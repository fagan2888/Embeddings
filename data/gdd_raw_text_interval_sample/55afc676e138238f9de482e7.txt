Forest P. Lyford
Introduction
' Test wells T-15, T-16, T-17, and T-18 were drilled between November 1968 and June 1969 as part of a continuing program by White Sands Missile Range to locate and evaluate potable water supplies in the area of Post Headquarters. These wells were drilled in bolson deposits southeast of Post Headquarters in Dona Ana County, New Mexico, on White Sands Missile Range and on Fort Bliss Military Reservation. Locations of the wells are shown in figures 1 and 2. Test well RC-3 was drilled during June of 1969 at Rhodes Canyon Range Center in Sierra County, New Mexico to investigate the availability of saline water to support a desalting plant. Rhodes Canyon Range Center is an isolated installation that occupies only a few acres of land. The purpose of this report is to present information retrieved during drilling and testing operations on each test well and to evaluate quality of water and aquifer properties in each locality.

All test wells were drilled by the hydraulic-rotary method to depths ranging from 750 to 2,500 feet. Samples of drill cuttings were collected at 10-foot intervals. A drilling-rate recorder provided a continuous record of the rate of bit penetration.
Upon completion of drilling, geophysical well logs of the following types were made: 1) proximity log - microlog with caliper; 2) dual induction - laterolog.
Water samples were collected from one or more zones in each test well by airlifting water from below an expansion packer that isolated higher water-bearing zones in the open hole. After water samples were collected a decision was made whether to case, develop, test, and retain the well for observation purposes. Such wells were cased with 8 5/8-inch outer-diameter steel casing with slotted sections opposite water-bearing zones. The mill-cut slots in the casing were 1/8-inch wide and 2 inches in length, placed 12 slots around and 3 rounds per foot. Retained test wells were developed by surging and bailing, and by surging and pumping. An 8-hour pumping test, followed by an 8-hour recovery test, then was conducted to evaluate aquifer characteristics. These test wells then were retained for future water-level observations and water-sample collection,
Throughout this report all depths are referenced to the landsurface datum. Depths shown on geophysical well logs are referenced to the kelly bushing which was 10 feet above the ground.

The contract administration and supervision of construction of the test wells was under the'direction of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. The U.S. Geological Survey, in cooperation with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and the White Sands Missile Range, provided technical assistance in well-site selection, contractspecification preparation, and hydrologic and geologic data collection. Geological Survey personnel involved in the collection of field data include G. C. Doty, Project Chief; F. E. Busch, J. A. Easier, and the writer, supervised by J. B. Cooper, Hydrologist and W. E. Hale, District Chief, Water Resources Division, Albuquerque, New Mexico.

Results of drilling and testing Test well T-15
Test well T-15 was started November 24, 1968. The Well was drilled with a 6 7/8-inch bit to a depth of 2,034 feet below the land surface. A description of well-cutting samples is given in table 1. Geophysical logs made in the well are shown in figures 3a, b. Two water samples were collected the first from below a packer set at 1,620 feet, and the second from below a packer set at 714 feet. Results of chemical analyses of these samples are given in table 11 f (p. 40).
After water samples were collected a cement plug was set from 670 to 690 feet and the well was reamed and cased to 670 feet. Slotted sections of pipe were placed from 446 to 476 feet, 507 to 522 feet, and from 595 to 650 feet. An attempt was made to develop the well by bailing but was discontinued because of the large quantities of sand bailed out with the water. No pumping test was conducted. The drilling and construction record of test well T-15 is given in table 2.
A cement platform was placed around the well casing and the well was retained for water-level and water-quality monitoring.
Water samples and resistivity values from geophysical well logs show a transition from potable to nonpotable water in test well T-15 between 850 to 1,000 feet below the land surface. Well depths, water sampling zones, water levels, construction details, and the approximate transition zone for test wells T-15, T-16, T-17, and T-18 are graphically summarized in figure 4, which is a profile drawn along the line A-A' of figure 2.

Test well T-16

Drilling on test well T-16 began January 25, 1969. A 6 7/8-inch

pilot hole was drilled to 2,007 feet below the land surface, geo-

physical well logs were made, and water samples were obtained by the

airlift method from below a packer set at a depth of 628 feet and

from below a packer set at a depth of 1,360 feet. Results of chemi-

cal analyses of water samples are given in table 11. A description

of well-cutting samples collected from the test well is given in

table 3 and geophysical logs with drilling time are shown in

figures 5a, b.

A cement plug was set from 710 to 730 feet and the well was

reamed to a diameter of 18 inches. Casing with slotted sections

from 310 to 360 feet, 470 to 500 feet, and 680 to 700 feet was then

placed in the well and surrounded by an envelope of 1/8- to 3/8-inch

diameter gravel emplaced in the annulus between the casing and the wall of the well. After development by surging and bailing for

18 hours and by surging and pumping for 19 hours, the well was pumped

at a mean rate of 175 gpm (gallons per minute) for 8 hours. During

the pumping test the sand content of the water discharged ranged from 3.5 ml/1 (milliliters per liter) at the start of pumping to 0.3 ml/1

at the end of pumping. The drilling and construction record of test

well T-16 is given in table 4.

Figure 6 is a graph of drawdown plotted against time since pump-

ing began in well T-16. The transmissivity (T) of the aquifer was

computed by the Jacob nonequilibrium method (Ferris and others,

1962, p. 98-100).

Figure 7 is a graph of drawdown plotted against the ratio of time since pumping began to time since pumping ended. The transmissivity of the aquifer was computed by the Theis recovery method (Ferris and others, 1962, p. 100-102). The values for transmissivity computed by the two methods agree well; the average value is 4,900 ft 2 /day. Results of chemical analysis of a water sample collected during the. pumping test are given in table 11.
After the pumping test, a concrete platform was placed around the well casing and the well was retained for water-level and waterquality monitoring.
Potable water in test well T-16 is present to a depth of about 800 feet. The water quality deteriorates rapidly between 800 and 1,000 feet, and then gradually worsens with increasing depth.

Test well T-17
Drilling of test well T-17 began April 7, 1969. A 6 7/8-inch pilot hole was drilled to 2,500 feet below the land surface, geophysical well logs were made, and water samples were obtained by the airlift method from below a packer set at 1,709 feet and from below a packer set at 1,023 feet. A description of well cutting samples collected from the test well is given in table 5 and geophysical logs, with drilling time, are shown in figures 8a, b.
After a concrete plug was set from 564 to 584 feet, the well was reamed to 18 inches and cased to 564 feet with slotted pipe from 443 to 472, from 492 to 504, and from 522 to 544 feet. The casing was centered by spacers welded to the casing every 200 feet. Gravel, 1/8- to 3/8-inch in diameter, was emplaced in the annulus, and the well was developed by surging and bailing for 24 hours and by surging and pumping for 24 hours. The drilling and construction record of test well T-17 is given in table 6.
Results of an 8-hour pumping test followed by a recovery test are shown with computed transmissivities in figures 9 and 10. The computed values of transmissivity are in close agreement and have an average value of 2,200 ft 2 /day. The gravel envelope was apparently effective in restricting sand movement because the discharged water contained only a trace of sand during the pumping test.

After the pumping test, a concrete platform was placed around the casing and the well was retained for water level and waterquality riionitoring.
The transition zone between potable and nonpotable water in test well T-17 is not well defined but seems to occur between 1,200 and 1,300 feet as determined from geophysical well Jogs. The dissolved solids content of 7,320 mg/1 in a water sample (table 11) collected below a packer set at 1,709 feet was considerably lower than dissolved solids in water samples collected from comparable depths in test wells T-15 and T-16 (table 11).
28

Test well T-18
Test well T-18 is located about 800 feet east of a fault scarp at the eastern edge of the Organ Mountains. Bedrock crops out about 200 feet west of the fault scarp. Drilling began May 19, 1969 and was to continue to a depth of 1,200 feet. Drilling rate decreased at a depth of 780 feet and remained low to 890 feet. At this depth a core run was made and about 4 feet of highly fractured monzonite fragments were recovered. Drilling was terminated at this point, geophysical well logs were run, and a water sample was obtained by the airlift method from below a packer sec at 505 feet. A description of well cutting samples collected from the test well is given in table 7 and geophysical well logs, with drilling time are shown in figures lla, b, Results of chemical analyses of water samples collected from the well are given in table 11.
A plug was set in the well from 704 to 724 feet, the well was reamed to a diameter of 9 inches, and casing was placed with slotted intervals from 506 to 524, 530 to 536, 572 to 580, 613 to 623, 632 to 652, and 676 to 684 feet. The well was then developed by surging and bailing for 24 hours and by surging and pumping 24 hours. A large volume of sand was removed during bailing and pumping. During the first three hours of pumping development approximately 30 percent of
«
the discharge by volume was very fine to medium sand. Near the end of pumping development the sand content had decreased to about 0.2 ml/1. The water was still slightly milky in color. The drilling and construction record of test well T-18 is given in table 8.

Results of an 8-hour pumping test followed by an 8-hour recovery test are shown in figures 12 and 13. Results of these tests are difficult to interpret because of several complicating factors. During the first hour of the test the well was developing and appreciable quantities of sand were being discharged. After 3 hours, pumping was stopped for 10 minutes for minor repairs to the gear head. The surge of stopping and starting the pump resulted in further well development; about an hour was required for the water to clear. Other factors affecting results of the pumping test include delayed drainage from water-bearing materials, storage in the well bore, and an apparent impermeable boundary condition that affected the latter parts of both the drawdown and recovery curves.
The middle portion of the recovery curve of figure 13 probably is affected least by complicating factors. This section when analyzed by the Theis recovery method gives a transmissivity of 184 ft 2 /day. The latter part of the drawdown curve of figure 12 can be used to compute transmissivity if the assumption is made that a vertical impermeable boundary affects this portion of the curve. In such a case the Jacob method can be used to compute transmissivity if the difference in drawdown in one log cycle (As) is divided by 2. This method gives a transmissivity of 153 ft 2 /day. These values of transmissivity are considerably lower than values obtained for T-16 and T-17. Lower transmissivities can be expected in poorly sorted materials near the mountain front (Herrick, 1960).
32

After the pumping test a concrete platform was placed around the casing and the well was retained for water-level and waterquality monitoring.
Water in T-18 is potable to, and probably within, the bedrock as shown by the water samples and well logs. Results of chemical analyses of a water sample collected during the pumping test are shown in table 11.

It should be noted that while the packer was set at 505 feet, water rose in the connecting pipe to 132 feet below the land surface after the well was pumped to obtain a water sample. Two months after the well had been reamed, plugged, cased, and tested, the water level stood at 257 feet below the land surface. This suggests that water in the fractured bedrock, or in some zone below the concrete plug set at 704 feet, is under a higher hydrostatic head than water above the zone. The possibility of higher pressure in the bedrock than in the unconsolidated materials is supported by water-level data collected from a nearby windmill well. This well is located about 1,000 feet west of T-18 at a slightly higher elevation. Bedrock can be seen at the surface only 180 feet west of the windmill well which would indicate the well is probably completed in bedrock. The water level in this well on May 29, 1969 was 132 feet below the land surface.
36

Test well RC-3
Test well RC-3 at Rhodes Canyon Range Center was started June 8, 1969 and drilled to a depth of 750 feet below the land surface. Nothing but clay, and clay with gypsum, was encountered during drilling (table 9).
Four zones were selected for water sampling using geophysical welllog information (figs. 14a,b). Water was obtained by the airlift method from below a packer set at the following depths: 560, 490, 390, and 253 feet. Maximum discharge from the lower three depths during pumping was 2 gpm and all sample zones produced muddy water that would not clear with continuous pumping. The uppermost sampling zone, produced 10 gpm.
Pumping from the lower sampling zone was discontinued after eight hours when discharge increased and field specific conductance decreased appreciably. It was assumed that the packer became, ineffective in separating upper zones of better water quality. Prior to the breakthrough, the field specific conductance was increasing with a maximum measurement of 25,500 micromhos. No sample was collected and no attempt was made to reset the packer at that depth because the hole had filled in below. Table 11 shows results of chemical analyses on water samples from the other three sampling zones.
37

It was decided, because of the poor quality of the water (table 11) and poor water-bearing properties of the material penetrated in test well RC-3, that a well drilled in this area would not meet production and desalting requirements. Therefore, development and further tests were not attempted and the well was sealed. The drilling and construction record is given in table 10.

Conclusions and recommendations
Data collected from test wells drilled southeast of Post Headquarters, White Sands Missile Range, show a fresh-water lens about 600 feet thick in the vicinity of T-15 and T-16. This lens thickens to about 1,000 feet near T-17. Supply wells completed near the sites of T-15, T-16, and T-17 should have yields in excess of 200 gallons per minute. Gravel packing should be considered as a means of minimizing sanding in future test and production wells in this locality.
Potable water in T-18 occurs to and probably within the bedrock that was encountered at a depth of 780 feet. The relatively low transmissivity measured in T-18 indicates that wells completed near the mountain front in unconsolidated materials will have lower yields than wells completed on fan deposits farther out in the basin.
The best quality of water measured in test well LC-3 at Rhodes Canyon Range Center apparently has a dissolved solids content in excess of 27,000 mg/1. Wells drilled in this area will encounter very fine-grained materials with poor water-bearing properties. Yields from such wells would probably not be greater than 15 or 20 gallons per minute.
