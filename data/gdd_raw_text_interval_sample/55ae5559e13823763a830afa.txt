ABSTRACT
Oil and gas trapped in Lower Silurian "Clinton" sands and Medina Group sandstone constitute a regional hydrocarbon accumulation that extends 425 mi in length from Ontario, Canada to northeastern Kentucky. The 125-mi width of the accumulation extends from central Ohio eastward to western Pennsylvania and west-central New York. Lenticular and intertonguing reservoirs, a gradual eastward decrease in reservoir porosity and permeability, and poorly segregated gas, oil, and water in the reservoirs make it very difficult to recognize clear-cut geologic- and production-based subdivisions in the accumulation that are relevant to resource assessment. However, subtle variations are recognizable that permit the regional accumulation to be subdivided into three tentative parts: a western gas-bearing part having more or less discrete fields; an eastern gasbearing part having many characteristics of a basin-centered accumulation; and a central oil- and gas-bearing part with "hybrid" fields that share characteristics ofboth discrete and basin-centered accumulation. A data set of 25 oil and gas fields is used in the report to compare selected attributes of the three parts of the regional accumulation. A fourth part of the regional accumulation, not discussed here, is an eastern extension of basin-centered accumulation having local commercial gas in the Tuscarora Sandstone, a proximal facies ofthe Lower Silurian depositional system.
A basin-centered gas accumulation is a regionally extensive and commonly very thick zone of gas saturation that occurs in low-permeability rocks in the central, deeper part of a sedimentary basin. Another commonly used term for this type of accumulation is deep-basin gas accumulation. Basin-centered accumulation is a variety of continuous-type accumulation. The "Clinton" sands and Medina Group sandstone part ofthe basincentered gas accumulation is characterized by: a) reservoir porosity ranging from about 5 to 10 percent; b) reservoir permeability equal to or less than 0.1 mD; c) low reservoir water saturation and an average water yield per well less than about 9 to 13 BW/MMCFG; d) a broadly defined updip water-block trap; e) underpressured reservoirs with a gradient ranging from 0.25 to 0.35 psi/ft; and f) reservoir temperature of at least 125°F (52°C).
Other than for historical and location purposes, the term field has little or no meaning as an assessment unit for the regional accumulation. In practice, each designated field represents a production sweet spot having relatively high EURs per well that in turn merges with surrounding gas-productive regions that are generally larger in area but have lower EURs per well. This important feature of the Lower Silurian regional accumulation, whereby most wells drilled into it are gas productive, must be considered when assessing its potential for remaining recoverable gas resources. Most of the remaining gas resources reside in "Clinton" sands and Medina Group sandstone in the basin-centered part of the accumulation where as much as several tens of TCP of natural gas may be technically recoverable. The Tuscarora Sandstone in the eastern extension of the basin-centered part of the accumulation underlies a very large area and, although commonly characterized by very low porosity and permeability and low-Btu gas, probably contains additional gas resources. Remaining undiscovered recoverable gas and oil resources in the discrete and hybrid parts ofthe accumulation are primarily located beneath Lake Erie.

INTRODUCTION
Two fundamentally different types of hydrocarbon plays were recognized in the regional, Lower Silurian oil and gas accumulation of the Appalachian basin for the U.S.Geological Survey (USGS) 1995 National Assessment of United States Oil and Gas Resources (Ryder, 1995; Ryder and others, 1996; fig.l).
The western part of the accumulation in east-central Ohio and northwesternmost Pennsylvania was defined as a play with conventional reservoirs and discrete fields, whereas an eastern part of the accumulation in eastern Ohio, northwestern Pennsylvania, western New York, northwestern West Virginia, and northeasternmost Kentucky was defined as a group of plays with unconventional reservoirs and regionally continuous zones of gas accumulation (fig. 1). The plays in the western and eastern parts of the regional accumulation were categorized, respectively, by the USGS as discrete (conventional) and continuous-type (unconventional) accumulations (Schmoker, 1995a,b). Major reservoirs in the Lower Silurian sandstone sequence consist of the "Clinton" sands and Medina sand in Ohio and adjoining West Virginia and their respective equivalents, the Grimsby Sandstone and Whirlpool Sandstone of the Medina Group, in Pennsylvania and New York. These sandstone units were deposited in shallow marine to estuarine environments. A third hydrocarbon play in the sequence, the Tuscarora Sandstone of west-central Pennsylvania, south-central New York, and west-central West Virginia is an eastern and more proximal facies of the Lower Silurian sandstone depositional system with a moderate fluvial component (Ryder, 1995; fig. 1). Although part of the regional Lower Silurian hydrocarbon accumulation, the Tuscarora Sandstone gas play with its generally small scattered gas fields is not discussed any further in this report.
General attributes assigned to the western (discrete/conventional) play in the USGS 1995 National Oil and Gas Assessment are: 1) discrete fields controlled by welldefined stratigraphic and (or) structural traps, 2) oil- and (or) gas productive regions surrounded by nonproductive regions, 3) sandstone reservoirs with good to moderate porosity and permeability, 4) well-defined oil- and gas-water contacts, 5) normal (hydrostatic) fluid pressures, 6) hydrocarbon production dominated by oil and associated gas, and 7) moderate to high water yields. Using a play analysis approach, where field size is the basic unit of assessment, the USGS estimated that, because of the densely spaced drilling in the play since the late 1870s, there are no remaining undiscovered fields of 1 million barrels of oil or greater (or 6 billion cu ft of gas or greater) except beneath Lake Erie. Thus, most of the remaining hydrocarbon resources in the western play were considered to be additions (growth) to existing reserves (Gautier and others, 1995; 1996).
The eastern (continuous-type/unconventional) plays were adopted from a deep basin/basin-centered model for the Clinton/Medina gas accumulation proposed by Davis (1984), Zagorski (1988, 1991), and Law and Spencer (1993). In this report, the term basin-centered accumulation is used. Following Rose and others (1986) and Law and Spencer (1993), a basin-centered gas accumulation is a regionally extensive and commonly very thick zone of gas saturation that occurs in low-permeability rocks in the central, deeper part of a sedimentary basin. Foreland basin examples, such as the Lower Silurian of the Appalachian basin, reside in the thicker, more deeply buried part of the

characteristic cratonward-tapered sedimentary wedge that lies updip of the thrust-faulted margin of the basin. Basin-centered gas accumulation is a variety of continuous-type accumulation (Schmoker, 1995a,b) and is synonymous with deep-basin gas accumulation (Masters, 1979; 1984). Tight gas (low-permeability) reservoirs described by Button and others (1993) are a necessary but not a sufficient condition ofbasin-centered gas accumulation.
General attributes assigned to the eastern (continuous-type/unconvential) plays in the USGS 1995 National Assessment ("Clinton" sands and Medina Group sandstone part of basin-centered accumulation of this report) are: 1) regionally extensive accumulations of nonassociated gas without stratigraphic or structural control on entrapment, 2) gas shows and (or) production after hydrofracturing in most wells drilled, 3) sandstone reservoirs with low porosity and permeability, 4) an absence of gas-water contacts, 5) rocks with high water saturation are situated updip of the gas accumulation and serve as the regional trap, 6) abnormally low formation pressures, and 7) low water yields. Because of the recency of drilling and production involving the eastern continuous-type plays (late 1970s to present), this part of the regional Lower Silurian accumulation is considered by the USGS to be an emerging source of natural gas. Using a new methodology (Schmoker, 1995b) that assumed a regionally extensive gas-saturated reservoir and used estimated ultimate recovery (EUR) of gas per well as a basic unit of assessment, the continuous-type plays were estimated to have, at a mean value, about 30 trillion cu ft (TCF) of technically recoverable gas (Gautier and others, 1995; 1996).
Primary objectives of this report are to compile a reliable set of oil and gas field data from the Lower Silurian regional accumulation and to develop criteria for subdividing it into discrete and basin-centered parts. Comprehensive field studies required for in-depth analysis of the Lower Silurian regional accumulation are sparse. However, numerous attributes of selected fields are available in the literature (Laughrey, 1984; Keltch and others, 1990), unpublished theses (Seibert, 1987; Zagorski, 1991), and published data sets (McCormac and others, 1996). At least two important elements of the second objective will be addressed. First, many of the criteria applied to the Lower Silurian regional accumulation in the 1995 National Assessment (Ryder, 1995) were based on Rocky Mountain basin analogues and, thus, need to be more rigorously tested with reliable Appalachian basin data. Secondly, the tentative boundary drawn by Ryder (1995) between identified discrete and continuous-type (basin-centered in this report) parts of the regional hydrocarbon accumulation needs to be validated. This boundary is presently located at the approximate downdip (eastern) limit of oil production (see fig. 2; Wandrey and others, 1997). Both elements identify a need to better define the nature and origin of a very complex hydrocarbon system.
Field-specific data collected for this investigation representing a variety of geoscience disciplines and conclusions reached from them are expected to increase the accuracy of future assessments of remaining recoverable natural gas and oil in the Lower Silurian regional accumulation. Assessment accuracy is expected to increase because of: 1) the better definition of the discrete and basin-centered parts of the accumulation each of which requires a different assessment methodology, and 2) a better understanding ofthe internal variability of the accumulation such as the distribution of production "sweet spots". Moreover, criteria developed for characterizing these Appalachian basin examples

AVAILABILITY OF RELEVANT OIL AND GAS FIELD DATA
The data set used in this report consists of 25 oil and gas fields that produce from the Lower Silurian "Clinton" sands, Medina sand, and Medina Group sandstones (table 1; figs.2, 3). Each of the 25 fields were chosen because of its wide variety of geological, geophysical, geochemical, reservoir, and production data that have been collected and recorded. Most of the field names are recognized by the petroleum industry as well as State geological surveys in the Appalachian basin region. Several fields have multiple names. Moreover, many of the older fields have coalesced with adjoining fields as a result of infill drilling. The data set is about equally represented by fields that occur in the discrete (13) and basin-centered (12) parts of the regional accumulation as delineated by Ryder (1995) and Wandrey and others (1997).
Recorded attributes for the selected oil and gas fields in the data set are: 1) location, 2) discovery date, 3) depth, 4) hydrocarbon types, 5) structural setting, 6) stratigraphic name of reservoir, 7) trap type, 8) porosity, 9) permeability, 10) natural fractures, 11) diagenesis, 12) water saturation, 13) volume and composition of produced water, 14) gas/water and (or) oil/water contacts, 15) reservoir pressure, 16) bottom-hole temperature, 17) well spacing, and 18) ultimate production. These data were compiled from published literature, unpublished M.S. and Ph.D. theses, records from State geological surveys and (or) oil and gas/mineral resources divisions, and records from petroleum industry files. Summary sheets for each of the 25 oil and gas fields cited in this report are shown in Appendices A through Y. This field data set and the one compiled by McCormac and others (1996) should be continually updated and expanded as new information become available.
COMPARISON OF SELECTED OIL AND GAS FIELD CHARACTERISTICS
Depth to Production and Hydrocarbon Types
A plot of depth to production vs. hydrocarbon type for the 25-field data set shows several clusters of data points (fig. 4). The depth to production for the oil and gas fields in the data set ranges from about 2,000 ft along the western margin of the discrete part of the accumulation in east-central Ohio (Homer, Appendix L, and Lancaster/Sugar Grove, Appendix O, gas fields) to as much as 6,200 ft near the eastern margin of the Clinton/Medina part of the basin-centered part of the accumulation in northwestern Pennsylvania (Oil Creek pool of the Cooperstown gas field, Appendix J).
Hydrocarbon types produced in the data set range from oil and associated gas to nonassociated gas. Intermediate categories of hydrocarbon type in the data set are 1) gas and associated oil and 2) gas and local associated oil. These general classes of hydrocarbon type are roughly determined by their gas-to-oil ratio (GOR) (fig. 4). For example, a GOR of 20,000 (cu ft of gas): 1 (barrel of oil) or greater defines a gas well or field. Few GORs are available for the fields in the data set so their location as plotted on

Figure 4. Plot of depth to production vs. hydrocarbon type for oil and gas fields. See table 1 for the field codes and appendices for the data. Also shown (heavy dashed lines) are approximate levels of equivalent vitrinite reflectance (%Ro) for the fields (Wandrey and others, 1997). The %R<, values are from Middle Ordovician rocks approximately 1,500 to 2,000 ft beneath Lower Silurian rocks.

the horizontal axis of figure 4 is very approximate. Several of the fields noted as having nonassociated gas as their hydrocarbon type also produce some condensate.
Most of the data fall in two slightly overlapping clusters (fig. 4). One of the data clusters consists primarily of fields in the discrete part of the regional accumulation that range in depth from about 2,800 to 5,100 ft and whose hydrocarbon types are either oil and associated gas or gas and associated oil. The second data cluster consists of fields in the basin-centered part of the accumulation that range in depth from about 4,300 ft to 6,200 ft and whose hydrocarbon types are either nonassociated gas or gas with local associated oil. The overlap of these data clusters is caused by gas and associated oil at about 4,000 ft in the Conneaut gas field (Indian Springs and Kastle pools; Appendices G, H) (fig. 2). Perhaps this overlap indicates that the Conneaut field has been misidentified as belonging to the basin-centered part ofthe accumulation. In this region of northwestern Pennsylvania, the discrete-basin-centered boundary ofRyder (1995) could be moved eastward to include the Conneaut gas field with the discrete part of the regional accumulation. Although obvious overlap occurs, figure 4 suggests that a depth of about 5,000 ft and a GOR of about 100,000:1 are threshold values to distinguish discrete verses basin-centered accumulations. Moreover, the addition of equivalent vitrinite reflectance (%Ro) isograds from Middle Ordovician strata about 1,000 to 1,500 ft below the Lower Silurian (Wandrey and others (1997) to figure 4 suggests that %Ro =1.10 may represent another threshold value for discriminating discrete versus basin-centered accumulations. Equivalent %Ro isograds may be significant for discriminating between discrete and basincentered accumulation because they identify areas of peak gas generation and, thus, favorable regions for basin-centered accumulation. Law and Dickinson (1985) report that in Rocky Mountain basin examples of basin-centered accumulation, %Ro = 0.94 corresponds to the top of active overpressuring, a temperature of 180° F (82° C), and the top of active gas generation.
Several small anomalous data clusters on figure 4 indicate that nonassociated gas can be present at shallow depths (2,000 to 3,000 ft) in the discrete and basin-centered parts of the accumulation. Shallow nonassociated gas in the Homer and Lancaster/Sugar Grove gas fields (fig. 2) characterizes a band of fields along the western margin of the discrete part of the accumulation that extends from northern Kentucky to Ontario, Canada. Moreover, shallow nonassociated gas in the Lakeshore gas field characterizes the basin-centered part of the accumulation (Ryder, 1995) in most of western New York State and adjoining Ontario, Canada (fig. 2). These large areas of shallow nonassociated gas that seem out of place with respect to their apparent thermal maturation history must be explained in petroleum generation and migration models that are proposed for the regional accumulation (Nuccio and others, 1997).
Structural Setting and Natural Fractures
The dominant structure associated with the Lower Silurian hydrocarbon accumulation is a gentle southeast-dipping homocline (<1°) that forms the northwest flank of the Appalachian basin (Knight, 1969; Boswell and others, 1993). In the 25-field data set, this dominant north- to northeast-striking structural trend commonly has a subtle overprint of structural terraces, anticlinal noses, faults, and fractures (table 2). Minor

closure is noted on several of the anticlinal noses. Moreover, several of the oil and gas fields are closely associated with probable basement-controlled, cross-strike structures such as the Cambridge arch (Baranoski, 1993; Root and Martin, 1995) and the TyroneMt. Union lineament (Rodgers and Anderson, 1984). The conspicuous absence of structural closure in the fields of the data set supports Knight's (1969) interpretation that structure has a negligible effect on entrapment in the regional accumulation. However, structure is considered important for controlling: 1) the segregation of oil, gas, and water in the reservoir (Knight, 1969), 2) conduits for hydrocarbon migration, 3) zones of preferential reservoir drainage (Bush and others, 1987), and 4) the distribution and character of naturally fractured reservoirs (Core, 1986).
Natural fractures are documented or inferred in over one-half of the fields in the data set (table 2). Many of the fractures accompany regional structures cited in table 1 and probably share a common origin with them. In the Best gas field (Appendix C) and the Carbon Hill oil field (Appendix D), measured fracture orientations in the "Clinton" reservoir are dominated by northwest- and northeast-trending sets. Outcrops ofDevonian strata near the Athens gas field (Appendix B) show similar fracture orientations. Very likely, the northwest-southeast oriented fracture sets were caused by compressive stresses during the Alleghanian orogeny (Engelder and Geiser, 1980; Engelder, 1985), whereas the northeast-southwest oriented sets were caused by contemporary compressive stresses on the crust of the eastern and midcontent regions of the U.S. (Zoback and Zoback, 1980; Engelder, 1982). Most petroleum-industry geologists recognize the importance of natural fractures for creating high-yield oil and gas wells in the Clinton and Medina sandstone reservoirs (Sitler, 1969; Alexander and others, 1985; Core, 1986). In wells stimulated by hydrofracturing, these natural fractures improve the permeability of the reservoir and the subsequent drainage of hydrocarbons into the wellbore. Also, Zagorski (1991) suggests that natural fractures are important conduits for migrating formation water. According to Zagorski, this water has dissolved chemically unstable grains, such as feldspar, to form highly productive gas-bearing zones with secondary porosity. Although concentrations of natural fractures are very important for predicting production sweet spots, they are widely distributed across both the discrete and basin-centered parts of the regional accumulation and, thus, have little discriminatory value.
Trap Types
Although most oil and gas fields in the Lower Silurian regional accumulation are identified as stratigraphic-trap fields (Knight, 1969; McCormac and others, 1996), many of them do not demonstrate a well-defined updip pinchout of the sandstone reservoir(s) (table 3). Entrapment of oil and (or) gas in these situations may be explained by several mechanisms: 1) subtle updip changes in depositional and (or) diagenetic facies and 2) high-water saturation in low- to moderate-permeability rocks (water block).
Subtle updip changes in reservoir character, for depositional and (or) diagenetic reasons, have been documented as the cause of stratigraphic entrapment of oil and gas in many shallow-marine and coastal terrigenous-clastic sequences (Harms, 1966; Reinert and Davies, 1976; Wood and Hopkins, 1992). Depositional and (or) diagenetic changes may create subtle increases in capillary pressure in a given reservoir that, in turn, form a barrier

to updip oil and gas migration (Berg, 1975; Schowalter, 1979; Vavra and others, 1992). The height of the hydrocarbon column is a direct measure ofthe effectiveness of the trap (Berg, 1975). That is, the thicker the hydrocarbon column the greater the differential capillary pressure between the reservoir and trap facies. Berg (1975) reports that permeable and water-bearing facies may form an effective barrier to hydrocarbon migration. Moreover, capillary pressures required to trap natural gas are higher than those required to trap oil. Undoubtedly, the majority ofthe stratigraphic traps in the Lower Silurian regional accumulation are controlled by similar factors.
The Athens gas field is one of a small number of Clinton/Medina fields that have been comprehensively studied for depositional and diagenetic facies variability and their effect on hydrocarbon entrapment (Laughrey, 1984). Laughrey reports that there is no obvious updip pinchout ofthe reservoir sandstones in the field but they do show an updip loss of porosity due to increased cementation. He proposes that gas may originally have been trapped in a paleostructure and cementation occurred at an associated gas-water contact beneath it. In a later episode oftilting that formed the present-day homocline, gas was kept in place by the pre-tilt zone of cementation. Gas is produced from the trapping facies but at lower initial rates than is produced from the reservoir facies (Laughrey, 1984).
Depositional facies of the Senecaville gas field (Appendix W) were studied in detail by Keltch and others (1990). They show that the field is a stratigraphic-trap accumulation caused by the updip pinchout of reservoir sandstone of distributary mouth bar and distributary channel origin. Four time slices through the 185-ft-thick "Clinton" sands-Cabot Head Shale interval show marked thickness variations of individual sandstone reservoirs ranging from 2 to 24 ft.
Except for the East Canton/Magnolia oil field (Appendix K; fig. 2) and its large associated gas cap, hydrocarbon columns in the "Clinton" sands of Ohio are relatively thin, perhaps averaging 50 ft thick or less. Such relatively thin hydrocarbon columns suggest that the trapping facies have capillary pressures that only slightly exceed those ofthe reservoir facies and, consequently, updip leakage of oil and gas has been a common condition ofthe regional accumulation. Schowalter (1979) postulated a stratigraphic-leak differential-entrapment model for such a setting where oil is trapped downdip from the gas. The model operates on the premise that the traps along a migration path are a series of displacement-pressure barriers that will hold a certain hydrocarbon column and leak gas preferentially to oil updip through the barrier before the trap is filled to its stratigraphic spillpoint (Schowalter, 1979). This model might account for the large gas fields that rim the western margin ofthe discrete part of the Lower Silurian regional accumulation in Ohio and Ontario, Canada. However, other origins for the gas also should be considered such as late-stage gas exsolution from oil during Mesozoic uplift and erosion of the Appalachian basin (R. C. Burruss, oral communication, September 1997).
High water saturation in low-permeability rocks was recognized by Masters (1979) as a dominant trapping mechanism for the deep basin Elmworth gas field in Lower Cretaceous strata of western Canada. This trapping mechanism differs from that accompanying conventional reservoirs because gas is overlain by water rather than the reverse. This mechanism of entrapment (commonly referred to as water block), is probably caused by moderate- to low-permeability rocks with high water saturation where
14

relative permeability of gas to water is reduced to essentially zero (Masters, 1979; Price, 1995). Gies (1984) suggests that the Elmworth deep basin (basin-centered) gas accumulation of western Canada is in a dynamic state of updip migration.
Davis (1984) and Zagorski (1988, 1991) applied the basin-centered (deep basin) concept to the Lower Silurian regional accumulation of the Appalachian basin. In Ohio, Davis interprets the eastern margin of the water-block trap to conform approximately with the -3,500 ft subsea structure contour at the top of the "Clinton" sands. In the area east of this contour line, which includes Best (Appendix C), East Canton/Magnolia (Appendix K), and Claysville fields (Appendix E), the "Clinton" sands are considered to be part of a 2,000-ft-thick gas column with no associated formation water (fig. 5). According to Davis (1984), west of this line the "Clinton" sands and their hydrocarbon accumulations are associated with formation water. Zagorski (1991) extends the line ofDavis (1984), and consequently the water-block mechanism of entrapment, into northwestern Pennsylvania along the updip margins of Sharon Deep (Appendix X), Kantz Corners (Appendix M), and Cooperstown (Appendix I) fields (fig. 5). There, the boundary between the water-block trap and the downdip gas accumulation is somewhat irregular as a result of its interaction with cross-cutting lineaments (Zagorski, 1996).
Of the 25 oil and gas fields in the data set, only the Cooperstown, Kantz Corners, and Sharon Deep fields having a water-block mechanism of entrapment can be clearly identified as belonging to the basin-centered part of the accumulation (table 3). The remainder of the fields in the data set, particularly those without a recognizable updip pinchout of the reservoir or a significant updip decrease in net sandstone thickness, have no distinguishing characteristics to classify them as either discrete or basin-centered accumulation. However, those fields characterized by an updip pinchout or decrease in thickness of the reservoir have a greater likelihood of being associated with the discrete part of the regional accumulation. Additional details of depositional and diagenetic facies variations and their associated capillary pressures are required to determine whether or not the traps are strictly stratigraphic. Data concerning the volume of produced water from these fields to be discussed in a following section of the report will provide a better understanding of the nature of entrapment. In particular, the produced water data are required to evaluate the disparity between the discrete and basin-centered accumulation boundaries identified by Davis (1984)-Zagorski (1991) and Ryder (1995).
Reservoir Porosity and Permeability
A plot of average reservoir porosity (<Dave) vs. average reservoir permeability (Kave) for the 25-field data set shows an expected direct relation between these variables (fig. 6). Although tentative, this plot suggests two distinct reservoir types in the Lower Silurian regional accumulation.; one type with Kave > 0.1 mD, <X>ave > 10%, and another with Kave < 0.1 mD, <X>ave < 10%. Furthermore, Kave = 0.1 mD is the threshold value used by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) to designate a tight (low-permeability) gas formation (Dutton and others, 1993), implying geologic significance to the regulatory limit.
Judging from figure 6, average reservoir permeability seems to be a reasonable first approximation for identifying discrete and basin-centered parts of the regional

accumulation. Of the 12 fields in the data set whose reservoirs have an average permeability of 0.1 mD or less, 8 fields are located in the basin-centered part of the regional accumulation as defined by Ryder (1995). In contrast, those fields in the data set whose reservoirs have an average permeability of greater than 0.1 mD, 9 of 13 are located in the discrete part of the accumulation. Although slightly different fields are involved, a 0.1 mD threshold value of average reservoir permeability has about the same degree of success for differentiating water saturated (discrete) versus gas saturated (basin-centered) parts of the regional accumulation as defined by the boundary ofDavis (1984) and Zagorski (1991).
The imperfect match between average permeability and accumulation type is further shown on the Grimsby-interval permeability map by Boswell and others (1993). This map suggests that highly irregular, northwest-oriented tongues having 0.3 to >1.0 mD permeability extend from the discrete part ofthe accumulation, where they predominate, into the basin-centered part of the accumulation where they eventually pinch out. In contrast, similarly oriented irregular tongues of lower permeability (<0.3 mD) are predominant in the basin-centered part of the accumulation but extend westward, tens of miles, into the discrete part ofthe accumulation.
Reservoir Water Saturation and Volume/Salinity ofProduced Waters
Law and Dickinson (1985) postulate that most reservoir water accompanying active basin-centered accumulation is at irreducible saturation levels. However, they add that mobile water may re-enter the accumulation after temperature and pressure reduction following basin uplift and erosion. Capillary pressure curves that show irreducible water saturation of a given reservoir rock are normally unavailable for the Lower Silurian accumulation and, thus, could not be used to help discriminate between its discrete and basin-centered parts. A plot of average water saturation (Sw) vs. depth to production shows a general trend of decreasing Sw with depth (fig. 7). Although the trend of the plot is consistent with basin-centered accumulation, the plot appears to have little value for differentiating discrete versus basin-centered parts ofthe accumulation as defined by Ryder (1995). Part of the reason for the poor discriminatory value of the plot is because reservoir permeability has not been accounted for as it would have been had irreducible water saturation been used.
Castle and Byrnes (in press) report that most water saturation in the Cooperstown field (basin-centered part; Appendix I) is at irreducible levels. Here, irreducible water saturation (Swi) ranges from 10 to 80 percent and varies inversely with porosity. Medina Group sandstones with porosity in the 6 to 8 percent range and Swi < 20 % contain the majority ofthe gas storage capacity in the reservoir whereas those with porosity less than 3 percent and Swi > 40% are non-pay.
Produced water has been reported for 20 fields in the data set (table 4) and, very likely, the remaining 5 fields will be reported as such when data are available. Of the 20 fields in the data set that produce water, 11 ofthem have information regarding the volume of produced water (table 4). Information ranges from incomplete reports that indicate "all wells produce some water" or "water production is low" to detailed reports that permit calculations of water production (table 4; fig. 7). Water production per well is

summarized in this report as barrels ofwater (BW) per million cu ft of gas (MMCFG). As suggested by the plot ofwater saturation (fig. 7), fields classified with the basin-centered part of the regional accumulation have lower volumes of produced water per well than fields classified with the discrete part ofthe accumulation (table 4). Four fields in the data set affiliated with the basin-centered part of the accumulation have an average yield per well that ranges from 9 to 13 BW/MMCFG (table 4; fig. 7). Water yields in this range or less may be a diagnostic feature of the basin-centered part of the accumulation. A water yield of 1,200 BW/MMCFG for the Logan field (Appendix Q) (fig. 7) suggests high water yields for the discrete part ofthe accumulation.
Produced water from the Lower Silurian regional accumulation is classified as a brine [>35,000 mg/1 total dissolved solids (IDS)] with sodium and chloride as dominant constituents and calcium and magnesium as major components (Stith, 1979; Breen and others, 1985; Lowry and others, 1988; Siegel and others, 1990; Rose and Dresel, 1990; Sanders, 1991). Sodium, calcium, and chlorine account for approximately 97% of the IDS (Sanders, 1991). Potassium and bromide are present in the brines as relatively concentrated minor components (Breen and others, 1985). These Na-rich brines in the Lower Silurian regional accumulation probably originated from the interaction of migrating connate water with beds of halite in the Upper Silurian Salina Group (Lowry and others, 1988; Rose and Dresel, 1990; Siegel and others, 1990)(see fig. 3 for the stratigraphic position ofthe Salina Group). Also, Lowry and others (1988) recognize a second type of brine (Ca-rich) that they imply may have originated beneath the Salina Group in the Appalachian basin. This second type ofbrine may represent water expelled during basin-centered gas generation and accumulation in a manner proposed by Law and Dickinson(1985).
Brine salinity expressed as TDS (in mg/1 or ppm) or as total concentration of common constituent elements (in ppm) is available for 14 ofthe fields in the data set. Salinity of the produced waters in the data set ranges from 147,000 to 327,000 TDS but is largely confined to a range of 200,000 to 300,000 TDS (fig. 7). In the data set used in this report there does not appear to be a correlation between salinity and depth to production or salinity and hydrocarbon type (fig. 7). However, larger data sets in Ohio suggest a regional eastward to southeastward decrease in Na-rich brine (Lowry and others, 1988) and divalent metal chlorides (Sanders, 1991). Sanders (1991) suggests that the southeastward decrease in divalent metal chlorides reflects an earlier stage of compaction-driven water flow toward the margin ofthe basin. Alternately, these waters characterized by a southeastward decrease in divalent metal chlorides could have been expelled during basin-centered gas generation and accumulation in a manner proposed by Law and Dickinson (1985).
Data in this report (table 4; fig. 7) reveal the important fact that water (brine) is produced from both discrete and basin-centered parts ofthe regional accumulation. Moreover, the data set suggests that fields in the basin-centered part of the accumulation produce less water than fields in the discrete part. Thus, although an oversimplification, the concept proposed by Davis (1984) whereby the Clinton/Medina hydrocarbon accumulation is subdivided into water-bearing and water-deficient compartments appears to be correct. Obviously more data are required to better quantify water production per well in terms of volume with respect to each MMCF of gas produced.
21

Judging from the small data set gathered to date, the basin-centered part of the regional accumulation seems to be characterized by an average water production per well of 13 BW/MMCFG or less.
Segregation of Gas and Fluids in Reservoirs
Of the few fields in the data set where fluid contacts were evaluated, none have recognizable oil-water or gas-water contacts. However, by analogy to the Arabia gas field in Lawrence County, Ohio (fig. 2), studied by Zagorski (1996), a gas-water contact could be present at the Homer and Lancaster/Sugar Grove gas fields. Moreover, probable oilwater and gas-water contacts although not reported as such appear to be present in the Onondaga oil field (Harkness, 1935) and locally in the Norfolk field (MacDougall, 1973) in Ontario, Canada (fig. 2). These proposed oil-water and gas-water contacts in the Canadian part ofthe regional accumulation may be very localized because they have not been reported in published investigations (MacDougall, 1973; Cochrane and Bailey Geological Services Ltd., 1986).
Referring to the regional Clinton accumulation in general, Lockett (1929) reports that, "gas occurs in the higher parts ofthe sandstone reservoir and, where the reservoir is relatively continuous, considerable oil has accumulated in its lower parts." He did not mention oil-water or gas-water contacts. This published comment by Lockett (1929) also seems to apply to oil-bearing fields in the data set such as 1) Best gas field (Seibert, 1987) and East Canton/Magnolia oil field (Sitler, 1969) where oil most commonly occupies a structurally low position with respect to gas and 2) Ravenna and Mantua/ Shalersville (Wilson, 1988) gas fields where oil seems to be associated with the thickest sandstone reservoirs. Exceptions such as the Lenox gas field (Munsart, 1975) where oil occurs in the structurally highest parts of the field and the Northeast Salem gas field (Seibert, 1987) where local oil lies updip or lateral to gas suggest special circumstances caused by paleostructure or marked stratigraphic variability within the reservoir.
Although water is most commonly located in the structurally lowest part of the reservoir, such as in the Lenox gas field (Munsart, 1975), it can appear anywhere. For example, in the East Canton/Magnolia oil field, the structurally highest part of the field produces the most water (Schrider and others, 1969). Moreover, long gas-to-water transition zones are reported in the Athens gas field (Laughrey, 1984) and in the Norfolk gas field (MacDougall, 1973). Finally, as discussed by Zagorski (1991), a zone of high water saturation is located updip ofthe Cooperstown and Sharon Deep gas fields and appears to serve as the trap. Even in this situation, the boundary between gas and water is very transitional and most water-bearing units contain some associated gas.
Normally, classical discrete (conventional) accumulations show well-defined gasoil-water, oil-water, or gas-water contacts due to the differential buoyancy ofthe fluid and gas involved. These well-defined oil-gas-water contacts are obviously missing in the discrete part of the regional accumulation in central and eastern Ohio, as defined by Ryder (1995). The absence of fluid-gas segregation begs the important question as to whether or not any of the oil and gas fields in central and east-central Ohio should be classified as discrete accumulations. A major cause of the poor oil-gas-water segregation observed here and the associated classification dilemma is pervasive reservoir heterogeneity.
22

Significant contributors to reservoir heterogeneity are relatively thin, intertonguing, lenticular sandstone bodies; marked depositional and diagenetic facies variability; and relatively low porosity and permeability. Another factor contributing to the classification dilemma is human nature. Commonly, we overly simplify a natural system into two end members when in reality it is far more complex (T. S. Dyman, written communication, March 1998). Only those fields observed or surmised to have gas-water contacts along the western margin of the accumulation are recognized here as true discrete (conventional) accumulations. The remainder of the discrete part of the accumulation as defined by Ryder (1995) is neither a discrete or basin-centered type and, thus, following Zagorski (1996), is tentatively classified as a hybrid type of accumulation.
Segregation of gas and water by a different mechanism occurs at the broad transitional contact between the discrete and basin-centered parts of the regional accumulation (Davis, 1984; Zagorski, 1988, 1991). By analogy to basin-centered accumulations in western North America (Gfies, 1984; Law and Dickinson, 1985), the zone ofhigh water saturation (water-block trap) located updip from the zone of high gas saturation consists, in large part, of mobile pore water that was displaced from deeper in the basin by large-scale gas generation. The continuous gas phase and irreducible pore water left behind constitutes the basin-centered gas accumulation. This mechanism can only operate in low- permeability rocks (Gies, 1984; Law and Dickinson, 1985; Price, 1995). The interface between downdip gas and updip water fluctuates according to rates of gas generation and accumulation vs. rates of gas loss. Law and Dickinson (1985) and Spencer (1987) suggest that gas generation and its net accumulation coincides with an overpressured phase in the basin that occurs during maximum burial and high heat flow whereas gas loss coincides with an underpressured phase that occurs during regional uplift and erosion. According to Gies (1984), the updip limit of high gas saturation is controlled by a regional facies change to sandstone reservoirs of higher permeability. This facies change to more permeable rocks permits buoyant forces to become dominant and, thus, permit gas to move updip at a rate that exceeds the rate of gas influx from lower permeability rocks in the deeper part ofthe basin.
Reservoir Pressure and Bottom-hole Temperature
A plot of reservoir pressure vs. depth to production for the data set shows that most of the Clinton/Medina reservoirs are underpressured with respect to a normal hydrostatic gradient for salt water (fig. 8). The plot shows considerable scatter because 8 fields include pressures calculated by Thomas (1993) in addition to those reported from other sources. Most pressures in the Thomas (1993) data set are higher than those from other sources, commonly by several hundred psi, because they represent bottom-hole pressure rather than wellhead pressure. However, in older fields, such as Homer and Lancaster/Sugar Grove, pressures calculated by Thomas (1993) tend to be lower than those reported from other sources because they were based on wells drilled after the original pressures had been greatly reduced.
The overall trend of the plot is toward increasing underpressuring with depth (fig. 8), a trend also recognized by Thomas (1993). Moreover, data points on the plot are grouped into two clusters. One cluster consists of fields very close to being normally

pressured and that define a trend with a gradient of approximately 0.35 to 0.40 psi/ft (fig. 8). All 5 fields in this cluster are from the discrete part of the regional accumulation and 4 of the 5 fields are located near the western margin of the accumulation where probable gas-water contacts occur. In contrast, the second cluster consists of fields that are markedly underpressured and that define a trend with a gradient of approximately 0.10 to 0.25 psi/ft (fig. 8). The second cluster is dominated by fields from the basin-centered part of the accumulation. Although overlap occurs, these two populations of pressure/depth gradients on figure 8 and also shown by Thomas (1993) may define useful criteria for differentiating discrete from basin-centered parts of the accumulation.
The origin of the underprejssuring is unresolved. According to Thomas (1993), no single existing hypothesis is sufficient to explain all the observed pressure trends. Most promising of the hypotheses appear to be basin hydrodynamics, deep basin gas saturation, epeirogenic movement, and horizontal flow (Thomas, 1993). Post-orogenic uplift ofthe regional accumulation with subsequent cooling and slow leakage of the hydrocarbons after an earlier phase of overpressuring offers another plausible explanation of the regional underpressuring (Law and Dickinson, 1985; C. W. Spencer, oral communication, May 1997).
Although the Lower Silurian regional accumulation has been modified by uplift and erosion, bottom-hole temperature may discriminate between discrete and basin-centered accumulation because it identifies areas of peak gas generation that were most favorable to basin-centered accumulation. A plot of bottom-hole temperature (corrected) vs. depth to production for the data set approximates a straight line that defines a regional temperature gradient of about 1.3°F/100 ft (23.7°C/km) (fig. 9). This gradient is slightly lower than the recognized norm of about 1.65°F/100 ft (30°C/km) but it is in general agreement with geothermal gradients shown for the Appalachian basin (American Association of Petroleum Geologists and USGS, 1976). A threshold temperature of about 125°F (52°C) separates most of the fields associated with the discrete and basin-centered parts of the regional accumulation (fig. 9). Moreover, as suggested in figure 4, a vitrinite reflectance -1.10 may be a plausible threshold value for discriminating discrete from basin-centered parts of the Lower Silurian regional accumulation. The 126° to 162°F (52° to 72°C) temperatures of fields in the basin-centered part of the accumulation (fig. 9) suggest significant cooling since the 180° to 200° F (82°-94° C) temperatures probably achieved during its active phase (Law and Dickinson, 1985; Spencer, 1989).
Ultimate Gas Recovery Per Well
Gas production expressed as estimated ultimate recovery (EUR) per well is available for 10 fields in the data set (table 5). These EURs are shown in table 5 as median (Fso) or mean (x) values depending on how they are reported in the literature or on probability plots used in this investigation (fig. 10). In fields such as Yorktown/Clay (Appendix Y) where production records are available for just the best 1 or 2 wells, the EUR is expressed as the 5th percentile (Fs) (table 5). EURs are most valuable where they are plotted as a probability distribution of at least 25 wells (fig. 10). However, only 5 of the 10 fields with mean or median EURs have been calculated from a probability plot; the remainder represent a "best guess" based on the experience of the reporting individual.

Judging from this preliminary data set, the fields from the basin-centered part of the accumulation have slightly greater median EURs than fields from the discrete part (fig. 11). Fields from the basin-centered part ofthe accumulation have median (or mean) EURs that range from 98 to 400 MMCFG per well whereas fields from the discrete part have median (or mean) EURs that range from 84 to 450 MMCFG per well. Far more production data are required from discrete and basin-centered parts of the accumulation before their EUR per well distributions are established. Also, additional production data are required to better understand the geologic causes of production sweet spots such as Ravenna (F50=200 MMCFG) and Cooperstown (x=400 MMCFG) fields (table 5, fig. 11), although it is probably significant that these fields adjoin fault zones and (or) surface lineaments.
DISCUSSION
The Clinton/Medina/Tuscarora basin-centered gas accumulation appears to differ significantly from the classic Cretaceous and lower Tertiary examples of the U.S. and Canadian Rocky Mountains and Great Plains (Masters, 1979, 1984; Law and Dickinson, 1985; Spencer, 1987). An important difference is the very wide transition zone that occurs between the Clinton/Medina/Tuscarora basin-centered, gas-bearing part of the accumulation and its updip discrete, oil- and gas-bearing part of the accumulation. Characteristics of this broad transition zone are: 1) low to modest water (brine) productivity, 2) a 50- to 75-mi-wide zone of oil-bearing strata in Ohio and northwestern Pennsylvania, 3) a general absence of hydrocarbon/water contacts, and 4) a continuous network of adjoining oil and gas fields. This zone of transition is so wide and the accompanying fields have coalesced to such a degree that the entire regional accumulation could be interpreted as a continuous-type accumulation.
One reason for the wide transition zone is the lack of an abrupt, regionally extensive depositional and (or) diagenetic facies change in the Clinton/Medina sandstone reservoirs. The sandstone bodies that constitute the reservoirs are so highly lenticular and complexly intertongued that they have similar properties, such as porosity and permeability, across a broad region. A general trend of eastward-diminishing porosity and permeability is noted across the regional accumulation but the rate of change is very gradual and, thus, no well-defined boundary exists between its discrete and basin-centered parts.
A second reason for the wide transition zone is that the regional accumulation has been substantially modified from its original basin-centered configuration. Among the probable post-generation/emplacement modifications to the regional accumulation are uplift and erosion, re-migration and slow leakage of constituent hydrocarbons, and mixing of several types of brine. A generalized model shown in figure 12 suggests how the Lower Silurian regional accumulation may have originated and how it was modified by post-entrapment processes. Important parts of the model include: 1) generation of oil and gas from a Middle Ordovician black shale source rock (Cole and others, 1987; Drozd and Cole, 1994; Ryder and others, 1998); 2) abnormally high fluid pressures caused by the transformation of oil to gas (Law and others, 1998), 3) updip displacement of moveable pore water by overpressured gas (Law and Dickinson, 1985), 4) post-orogenic uplift and

erosion resulting in temperature decline, pressure loss, hydrocarbon remigration and loss, and basinward retreat of the updip limit of the basin-centered gas (Law and Dickinson, 1985), and 5) mixing ofbasin-centered and discrete parts ofthe accumulation with highdensity brine derived from the Upper Silurian Salina Group.
The timing of mixing between Salina Group- and basin-center-derived brine is important for understanding the origin of the regional accumulation. The model shown in figure 12 suggests that brine from the Salina Group was introduced in Mesozoic time, much later than gas generation and entrapment in late Paleozoic time. B. E. Law (written communication, March 1998) favors pre-gas emplacement for the Salina Group-derived brine because ofthe unlikelihood that saline water has re-entered "Clinton" sands and Medina Group sandstone reservoirs during the underpressuring phase.
Because of its high degree of modification, one should perhaps also think about a paleo-configuration as well as a present-day configuration when classifying the accumulation as a whole. An understanding ofthe paleo-configuration ofthe accumulation would require reconstruction of the "zone of retreat" to determine the maximum updip extent ofthe original basin-centered gas. However, the most practical approach to classifying the Lower Silurian regional accumulation and its components, particularly for resource assessment purposes, is to work within the present-day framework established by Davis (1984), Zagorski (1991, 1996), and Ryder (1995). A tentative classification scheme that incorporates their contributions is shown in figure 13. This classification recognizes three parts ofthe regional accumulation: 1) an eastern, basin-centered part, 2) a western, quasi-discrete part, and 3) a wide, central hybrid part. This classification is imperfect because of the very subtle differences between its three components but it incorporates factors that are relevant to an understanding of the accumulation's origin as well as to its recoverable energy resources.
Other than for historical and location purposes, the term field is meaningless as an assessment unit for this regional accumulation. In practice, designated fields within the regional accumulation are production "sweet spots" having high EURs per well. Because of the lenticular and intertonguing nature of the sandstone reservoirs, wells surrounding the sweet spots also are gas and oil productive but characteristically they have lower EURs per well. Development and exploration drilling around given sweet spots in the regional accumulation gradually evolve into an elaborate hydrocarbon mosaic whose constituent parts have differing ultimate production capabilities. This important characteristic ofthe Lower Silurian regional accumulation must be considered when assessing its potential for remaining recoverable gas and oil resources.
CONCLUSIONS
1. Oil and gas trapped in Lower Silurian shallow marine and tidally influenced (estuarine) sandstone reservoirs of the Appalachian basin constitutes a regional hydrocarbon accumulation with large recoverable gas resources. Based on subtle variations, the regional accumulation is tentatively subdivided into three parts: an eastern, basincentered part, a western quasi-discrete part, and a wide central hybrid part having characteristics of both the discrete and basin-centered parts. Very likely, all three parts could be assessed with an EUR per well approach. A fourth part ofthe regional

accumulation, not discussed in this report, is an eastern extension of the basin-centered part where gas is trapped locally in a thicker sandstone sequence that represents a more proximal depositional setting with a moderate fluvial component. 2. The regional accumulation is characterized by such a broad region of interconnected oil and gas fields that, other than for historical and location purposes, the term field is meaningless as an assessment unit. In practice, designated fields represent production sweet spots having high EURs per well that merge gradually with surrounding regions that are also productive but have lower EURs per well. 3. Most of the resources reside in "Clinton" sands and Medina Group sandstone in the basin-centered part of the regional accumulation where as much as several tens of TCF of gas are estimated to be technically recoverable. However, the Tuscarora Sandstone in the eastern extension of the basin-centered part of the accumulation underlies a large area and, although characterized by very low porosity and permeability and low Btu gas, its potential for basin-centered gas should not be ignored. Remaining gas and oil resources in the discrete and hybrid parts ofthe accumulation are located primarily beneath Lake Erie. 4. Stratigraphic traps are the dominant mode of entrapment in the discrete and hybrid parts of the accumulation. These traps are caused by subtle lateral changes in depositional and (or) diagenetic facies. Locally, anticlinal noses and fault blocks play a secondary role in entrapment. A broad water-block trap, where water is located updip from the gas-saturated reservoir intervals, seems to control entrapment of the basincentered part of the accumulation. 5. The basin-centered part of the accumulation is characterized by: a) reservoir permeability equal to or less than 0.1 mD, b) low reservoir-water saturation and average water yield per well ranging from 9 to 13 BW/MMCFG, c) broadly defined water-block trap updip of the gas-saturated regional reservoir, d) underpressured reservoirs with gradients ranging from 0.25 to 0.35 psi/ft, e) reservoir temperature of 125°F (52°C) or greater, f) depth of production at 5,000 ft or greater, and g) a dominantly gas-bearing reservoir sequence. 6. The discrete part of the regional accumulation is characterized by: a) reservoir permeability greater than 0.1 mD, b) high reservoir-water saturation and average water yield per well of several hundred BW/MMCFG or more, c) facies-change and(or) diagenetic Stratigraphic traps, d) normally pressured to slightly underpressured reservoirs, e) reservoir temperature lower than 125°F (52°C), f) depth of production at 2,000 to 2,500 ft or less, and g) a dominantly gas-bearing reservoir sequence. 7. The hybrid part ofthe accumulation is both oil and gas bearing and has characteristics of both the basin-centered and discrete parts. 8. Available data indicate that EURs per well are very similar for the basin-centered (median range of 98 to 400 MMCF of gas) and hybrid parts (median range of 84 to 450 MMCF of gas) of the accumulation. No EUR per well data are available for the discrete part of the regional accumulation but it is expected that they would exceed these values. 9. High-salinity formation water (brine) with TDS = 200,000 to 300,000 mg/1 (ppm) commonly is produced from all parts of the regional hydrocarbon accumulation. Very likely these brines were derived from connate water derived from the Upper Silurian
34

Salina Group evaporite beds. Moreover, these Salina-derived brines may have mixed with an earlier brine derived during dewatering and (or) gas generation in the deep Appalachian basin. 10. The basin-centered part of the Lower Silurian regional accumulation has been significantly modified by post-emplacement episodes of uplift and erosion. Among the modifications are a reduction in temperature, gas remigration and loss, a reduction in fluid pressure from above normal to subnormal, and mixing with circulating brine. Many of these observed modifications to the Lower Silurian basin-centered accumulation differ largely by degree from those affecting the classic western U.S. and Canadian examples because of the much greater time involved (200+ million years versus 50 to 60 million years) following hydrocarbon emplacement and entrapment. However, some of the differences between the Lower Silurian Appalachian basin and Cretaceous-Tertiary Rocky Mountain basin-centered accumulations may be related to fundamentally different geologic processes.
