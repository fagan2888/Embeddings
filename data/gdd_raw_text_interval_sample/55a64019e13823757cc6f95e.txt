Overview of Environmental and Hydrogeologic Conditions near Port Heiden, Alaska
By Eppie V. Hogan
ABSTRACT
Port Heiden is an embayment of Bristol Bay on the Alaska Peninsula about 700 kilometers southwest of Anchorage. Port Heiden Airfield is about 5 kilometers northeast of the fishing village of Meshik. The Federal Aviation Administration operates airway-support and navigational aids at the Port Heiden Airfield. They are considering environmental and hydrogeologic conditions when evaluating options for environmental compliance that may be required at the airfield. Climatic conditions near Port Heiden are affected by the Bering Sea and the North Pacific Ocean and are characterized by high humidity, heavy precipitation, and frequent cloudy periods. Vegetation consists of tundra, shrub tundra, and beach vegetation. Geologic materials in the Port Heiden area consist of volcanic ash and debris-flow deposits, till, estuarine deposits, swamp deposits, alluvial deposits, outwash deposits, and marine-terrace deposits. The Meshik River and numerous creeks, lakes, and wetlands are the freshwater bodies in the Port Heiden area. The principal aquifers near Port Heiden consist of unconsolidated sand and gravel, volcanic tuff (mostly pumice), and bedrock. Ground water is the principal drinking-water source for local residents. Alternative drinking-water supplies may be obtained from local surface-water sources or from ground water in noncontaminated areas; however, available data are inadequate to characterize the present quantity and quality of these alternative sources.
INTRODUCTION
The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) owns and (or) operates airway support and navigational facilities throughout Alaska. At many of these sites, fuels and potentially hazardous materials such as solvents, polychlorinated biphenyls, and pesticides may have been used and (or) disposed of. To determine if environmentally hazardous materials are present at the sites, the FAA is conducting environmental studies mandated under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act and the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act. To complete these more comprehensive environmental studies, the FAA requires information on the hydrology and geology of areas surrounding the sites. This report, the product of compilation, review, and summary of existing hydrologic and geologic data by the U.S. Geological Survey, in cooperation with the FAA, provides such information for the FAA facility and nearby areas at Port Heiden, Alaska.
ABSTRACT 1

BACKGROUND
Location
The Port Heiden Airfield is on the Alaska Peninsula at lat 56°57' N., long 158°38' W. about 700 km southwest of Anchorage and about 5 km northeast of Meshik (fig. 1). Port Heiden, an embayment of Bristol Bay, is south of the airfield (fig. 1). The dominant physical feature near Port Heiden is Aniakchak Crater, which is about 30 km to the east. The crater is an active volcanic center that last erupted in 1931.
Facility History
In March 1949, the FAA began maintaining air-navigation facilities at the Port Heiden Airfield (fig. 1). Currently, the FAA has a Remote Center Air-Ground Communications (RCAG)TNondirectional Beacon (NDB)TDirectional Measuring Equipment (DME) Facility, Visual Approach Slope Indicators (VASI), and an Automated Weather Station. Detailed lists of FAA facilities and potential sources of environmental contamination are in an environmental compliance investigation report by Ecology and Environment, Inc. (1993).
PHYSICAL SETTING
Climate
Port Heiden has a maritime climate (Hartman and Johnson, 1984). Climatic conditions are affected by the Bering Sea and the North Pacific Ocean and are characterized by small temperature variations, high humidity, heavy precipitation, and frequent cloudy periods. Cyclonic storms with high winds, fog, and poor visibility occur frequently (Hartman and Johnson, 1984). Mountainous terrain of the Aleutian Range is about 10 km east of Port Heiden and provides protection from approaching southeasterly winds and precipitation. The mean annual temperature for the periods 1927-52 and 1957-87 for Port Heiden is 2.3 °C. Mean monthly temperatures range from an August mean maximum of 14.4 °C to a February mean minimum of -8.9 °C (Leslie, 1989; table 1). Mean annual precipitation is about 395 mm, and mean annual snowfall is about 1,310 mm. Mean monthly and annual temperature, precipitation, and snowfall for Port Heiden, Alaska, are summarized in table 1.

Vegetation
Vegetation in the Port Heiden area consists of tundra, shrub tundra, and beach vegetation (Viereck and Little, 1972; National Park Service, 1987). Wet-tundra vegetation grows in lowlands on poorly drained organic-rich soils and is dominated by water-tolerant plants such as sphagnum. Moist-tundra vegetation grows on terraces, subalpine slopes, and coastal lowlands and consists of heaths, shrubs, and grasses. Alpine tundra vegetation is found on exposed slopes in upland areas and on the summits of ridges and knolls and consists of scattered heaths, lichens, and mosses. Shrub tundra is found on moderately well-drained lowlands and slopes below about 300 m elevation and consists of alder, willow, and grasses. Beach vegetation is found on well-drained coastal sand dunes and consists principally of ryegrass.
GEOLOGY
Detterman and others (198 la, b) mapped the geology of the Port Heiden area. Major geologic units include volcanic deposits, till, estuarine deposits, swamp deposits, alluvial deposits, outwash deposits, and marine terrace deposits.
Volcanic deposits in the Port Heiden area consist of pumice, ash, debris-flow deposits, and ash-flow tuff of Holocene and Pleistocene age (Detterman and others, 198la). The ash-flow tuff was deposited during the caldera-forming eruption of Aniakchak Crater about 3,400 years before present. This tuff is unsorted, poorly stratified, and composed of pumice and scoria in a matrix of fine to coarse ash and lithic fragments (Detterman and others, 198la). The ash-fall tuff is moderately well sorted, well stratified, and consists of fine- to medium-grained dacitic ash. Near the airfield, volcanic deposits are exposed on either side of the runway, around the radio beacon, on slopes adjacent to Reindeer Creek and Aniakchak Crater, and along the eastern shoreline of Hendrickson Lake (fig. 1). Depth to volcanic deposits in other areas is not known specifically but will likely be encountered between 25 and 60 m (appendix 1).
Numerous arcuate moraine ridges are present in the Port Heiden area. Moraines consist of weathered, unsorted, and nonstratified till and have an irregular knob and kettle surface topography. Estuarine deposits found along the Bering Sea coast consist of dark-brown to black organic silt and clay. Swamp deposits are adjacent to the estuarine deposits south-southwest of the Port Heiden Airfield. These deposits form by the accumulation of sedge and sphagnum peat. A large alluvial fan, consisting mostly of well-sorted pumice, extends eastward from the base of Aniakchak Crater toward the coast. These deposits extend to about 10 km east of the airfield. Alluvial deposits also are found adjacent to Reindeer Creek (fig. 1). Outwash deposits found northwest of the airfield consist of moderately well-sorted and stratified sand, silt, and gravel that form a flat to gently sloping plain. Marine terrace deposits south of the airfield are typically about 15m above mean high tide. These deposits consist of stratified and well-sorted sand and gravel that form level plains truncated by steep wave-cut scarps.
Soils in the Port Heiden area generally are poorly developed because of the frequent deposition of volcanic ash (Rieger and others, 1979; Howard Grey and Associates, Inc., 1982). Where soils are well developed, they are dark brown to reddish brown and typically have buried surface horizons because of repeated deposition of volcanic ash. The soil particles are mostly sand or gravel size (Howard Grey and Associates, Inc., 1982). The Port Heiden area generally is free of permafrost (Ferrians, 1965).

HYDROLOGY
Surface Water
The Meshik River and numerous creeks, lakes, and wetlands are the principal freshwater bodies in the Port Heiden area (fig. 1). The mouth of the Meshik River is about 25 km south of the Port Heiden Airfield. The river originates on the southern slopes of Aniakchak Crater and flows south and westward into Bristol Bay. A lake and several small tributaries that drain the southern flanks of the volcano feed the Meshik River. The headwaters of most other creeks in the area also originate on the slopes of the Aniakchak Crater and flow west-southwest toward Port Heiden and Bristol Bay. Birthday Creek passes the airfield about 10 km to the south; Barabara Creek passes about 8 km to the south; Abbott Creek passes less than 2 km to the south; and Reindeer Creek passes about 4 km to the north (fig. 1). Hendrickson Lake is about 0.65 km2 in size and is about 2.5 km east of the airfield; Sven Lake has a surface areas of about 0.3 km and is about 2 km to the southeast; and Goldfish Lake has a surface area of about 0.5 km2 and is about 5.5 km to the south-
O ij
west. Mean annual runoff near Port Heiden is estimated to be about 0.01 to 0.02 (m /s)/km (T.P. Brabets, U.S. Geological Survey, written commun., 1995; Selkregg, 1976).
Small local streams may not be adequate sources of drinking water because of relatively low discharge, probable tidal influence, and dissolved-iron concentrations (appendix 1) that likely exceed U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) and Alaska Department of Environmental Conservation drinking-water regulations (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 1995; Alaska Department of Environmental Conservation, 1995). A stream that is impounded above tidal influence could possibly supply a small local population; however, the feasibility of such an impoundment is unknown. Water samples were taken from Abbott Creek in 1981, and major ions, dissolved metals, radioactivity, and other water properties such as pH were determined. Dissolved-iron concentrations of 1.5 mg/L and manganese concentrations of 0.56 mg/L exceed current USEPA drinking-water regulations of 0.3 and 0.05 mg/L, respectively (appendix 2). Analyses of water from Goldfish Lake indicate an iron concentration of 0.8 mg/L, but other measured water properties are within current drinking-water regulations.
The tide range averages 3.7 m near Port Heiden (Brower and others, 1977). The maximum daily tide is about 4.4 m above sea level, and the minimum tide is about -1.3 m below mean sea level (Brower and others, 1977). Surface-water bodies and aquifers near the coast probably are influenced by tides.
Flooding and Erosion
According to the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (1993), Port Heiden has a low flood-hazard rating and there is no record of flooding in the area. Beach erosion is a common phenomenon near Port Heiden (U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, 1993). Storm surges at high tide may cause beach erosion and landward migration of the beach. The rate of beach erosion near Port Heiden is estimated to be about 0.4 m/yr (appendix 1). Brower and others (1977) describe return periods for maximum significant waves for Port Heiden. A 5-year wave of 13 m is estimated for coastal areas near Port Heiden. A wave of this magnitude would not affect the Port Heiden Airfield, which is at an elevation more than 20 m. However, maximum significant waves with return periods in excess of 50 years are higher than 20 m (Brower and others, 1977).

SUMMARY
The Port Heiden Airfield is on the Alaska Peninsula about 700 km southwest of Anchorage and about 5 km northeast of the fishing village of Meshik. Climatic conditions are influenced by the Bering Sea and the North Pacific Ocean and are characterized by small temperature variations, high humidity, heavy precipitation, and frequent cloudy periods. Vegetation in the Port Heiden area consists of tundra, shrub tundra, and beach vegetation. Geologic materials in the Port Heiden area consist of volcanic ash and debris-flow deposits, till, estuarine deposits, swamp deposits, alluvial deposits, outwash deposits, and marine terrace deposits. The Meshik River and numerous creeks, lakes, and wetlands are the chief fresh surface-water bodies in the Port Heiden area. The main aquifers near Port Heiden consist of unconsolidated sand and gravel, volcanic tuff (mostly pumice), and bedrock. Ground water is the chief drinking-water source for residents in the Port Heiden area. Surface water and other ground-water sources represent alternative potable resources for the area. However, adequate data are not available to determine the present quality and quantity of these alternative drinking-water sources.

SUMMARY:
The United States Public Health Service proposes the construction of a potable water supply for the Port Heiden Native village of Meshik. Water availability has been discussed in earlier Public Health Service and other reports. The following summarizes available information and outlines most probable soils and groundwater conditions.
CONCLUSIONS:
1. Soils in general consist of alluvium, beach deposits, dune sands, glacial deposits, and volcanic ash deposits. Boggy areas are likely underlain by thin to thick organic silts.
2. Depth to bedrock is not known specifically but apparently is about 100 feet below the ground surface. Bedrock probably consists of layered sedimentary (shales, silty sandstone) and volcanic (breccia, sandstones, flows) rocks.
3. Discontinuous permafrost may exist in the Meshik vicinity but a thick active layer is probable. Although no permafrost is probable within the village, the most likely area for its presence is near the southeastern shore of Goldfish Lake.
4. Surface water sources include nearby shallow lakes and small streams. Analysis of water from Goldfish Lake shows a high iron content (0.8 ppm) but otherwise good quality water. Quality may deteriorate under winter ice. Ocean wave contamination of Goldfish Lake could occur during severe storms but is not likely. Streams are marginally feasible as water sources due to very low discharge, possible tidal influence, and a likely high dissolved iron content.
5. Shallow wells (16 to 20 feet) produce water for individual households and the village school. Water quality is fair to poor. Iron content apparently has a range of about 0.3 ppm to 2.5 ppm. Chloride content increases seasonally. Water production declines slightly during cold winters.
6. In the Port Heiden area deeper wells produce 20 to 25 gpm from bedrock aquifers. Well logs are not available but it is probable that the aquifers consist of shattered sedimentary or porous volcanic rock, particularly volcanic breccia or vesicular lavas. The water quality is fair with a dissolved iron content of 0.35 to 0.9 ppm. Chloride content is very low.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Construction of a deep community well at Meshik is recommended. A deep well should produce greater quality and quantity water than a shallow well and would be less subject to saltwater encroachment.
2. The deep well should be drilled into bedrock to intercept a bedrock aquifer. Neither casing nor screening should be required in the rock portion of the well. Bedrock will likely be encountered above 85 feet below the ground surface but may be as deep as 200 feet. Bedrock aquifers can be anticipated betv/een 85 and 150 feet below the surface.
3. Drilling in the surface sediments should, in general, be fairly easy. However, dense gravels and some cobbles and boulders may be encountered In addition, wells may enter breccia - angular coarse rock fragments in the bedrock sequence.

APPENDIX 4
Port Heiden Well Report, a written communication from R. Ingersoll, U.S. Public Health Service
A-4

The Port Heiden Village Council requested assistance from the U.S. Public Health Service in March 1974 to drill a deep well and develop a watering point for the community. The Indian Health Service (IHS), of the Public Health Service, acting under Public Law 86-121 (0MB 13.229) commenced drilling in May 1979. The drilling of the Port Heiden Well was done by the cable tool pecussion method with a Kirk - Hi 11man drill rig.
The formations drilled through were of unconsolidated rock mostly of glacial origin. Drilling through unconsol-idated material was accom- / piished by loosening the rock fragments by the repetitive impact action of the drill bit which produces a slurry - like mixture with the water in the hole. A jet pump supplied water from nearby Goldfish Lake.
The drill log of the formations encountered and a schematic drawing is on the following pages. The drill log was determined by examining the samples coming out of the hole when bailing. At first a dart valve bailer was used, but later on a sand pump was found to be more efficient.
Two sizes of casing were used at the site, 8-nnch and 6-inch. The outer 8-inch casing penetrated to a 31 foot depth to a layer of low permeability which in this case was a blue clay. However, due to heaving problems it was not penetrated properly. The outer casing's purpose is to keep the hole open for a grout seal at the completion of the well. The inside 6-inch casing closely follows the progress of the drill bit. Its purpose is to prevent caving and keep the .hole open in unconsolidated materials. Many problems occurred near the end of the casing driving process. Sand heaved up into the hole several times and once as much as 35 feet. Welding and cutting pipe for casing was required frequently in the driving and bumping process. Most of this type of work was handled by Henry Horner. as shown in the accompanying photographs.
An as-built was made of the well location. There is a possibility that the village may move to the north side of Goldfish Lake in a few years due to a serious beach erosion problem.
A confined aquifer was encountered at the 150 foot depth. A 5 foot 15 slot Johnson Watermark well screen was selected and installed by the pull back method. This is where the screen is set at the bottom of the casing and the casing is then pulled back to expose the screen.
After setting the screen, the outside casing was bumped out and grout' was pumped into the annular space. This was the first well where we used a grout pump. It worked fairly well, but there was not enough clearance between the outside and inside casing to move the copper tubing grout line down to the bottom of the outside casing. In the future a larger outside casing will be used. A grout mix of

approximately 10 to 12 gallons of water, 5 to 10 Ibs. of bentonite to one sack of type 1 portland cement. Initially a mix of 6 gallons water, one can of bentonite (3 Ib. coffee can) was added to a sack of cement. However, the mix proved to be to be much too thick to be pumped through the grout pipe. All 8 bags of concrete available were used and the remaining annul us was filled with gravel as advised by myself.
Development of the well was done by a surge block assembly. Devel- . opment increases permeability of the natural formation, stabilizes the sand, and corrects any damage to the formation. Surging and bailing was done for five hours.
Many problems occurred during test pumping because it was difficult to get a constant steady source of electricity. The generator on the welding unit could not supply the right voltage so the pump would stop after a short period of time. In addition, the village was having trouble with their diesel generator so it would shut off intermittantly. However, a 9 hour drawdown test was obtained running the pump at a constant 25 gallons per minute>(gpm).
The quality of the water was visibly poor due to the high iron content, Lab tests were run on a sample and the results are on the following page. It should also be noted that a rough level was run from the high tide mark of the Bristol Bay which is approximately 1,200 feet from the well. The top of the casing was found to be 16.5 feet above the high tide mark which would mean that the static water level in the well has approximately 2 feet of head above high tide. Thus over pumping should be avoided due to the threat of salt water intrusion. The maximum transmitting capacity from a well with a 15 slot screen at the recommended entrance velocity of 0.1 ft./sec is calculated by multiplying the number of square inches of open area by a factor of 0.31 (Reference - "Groundwater and Wells", Johnson, pp. 193 and 194)
Transmitting = 0.31 (30 gpm) (5 ft.) = 46.5 gpm
Capacity
The well was test pumped at 25 gpm which is then less than the transmitting capacity of the screen.
After test pumping a concentrated solution of HTH (dry chlorine) and water was poured down the well for disinfection purposes. Finally the rig was taken apart for transporting to the airport. Basically the mast was taken down and then the frame with the engine was dragged on skids to the airport.
