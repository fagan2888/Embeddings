FORAMINIFERA FROM THE NORTHERN OLYMPIC PENINSULA, WASHINGTON

By WELDON W. RAU

ABSTRACT
Foraminifera from a Tertiary sequence that crops out on the northern part of the Olympic Peninsula, Wash., show stratigraphic and ecologic significance. Forty-two species that are important both to correlations and to eeologic interpretations are illustrated and systematically discussed. The Foraminifera indicate that some of the rocks may be as old as early Eocene. The oldest rocks are tentatively referred to the Penutian stage of Mallory. Other parts of the sequence are referred to the Ulatisian and Narizian stages of Mallory, the Refugian stage of Schenck and Kleinpell, and the Zemorrian and Saucesian stages of Kleinpell.
Several short periods of shallow, sheltered sea conditions are suggested by the Foraminifera from several parts of the stratigraphic sequence, but Foraminifera from most of the rocks suggest relatively deep, open-sea conditions. With the exception of shallow, warm-water conditions in rocks of probable middle Eocene age, the Foraminifera suggest that cool-to-cold water temperatures, regardless of depth, prevailed during the deposition of most of the rocks of Tertiary age in the northern Olympic Peninsula.
INTRODUCTION AND ACKNOWLEDGMENTS
This report deals with the stratigraphic and eeologic significance of Foraminifera contained in a Tertiary sequence that crops out in the northern part of the Olympic Peninsula, Wash. (pi. 1). The work was done as a part of a program of geologic investigations for oil and gas possibilities conducted by the U.S. Geological Survey. The geology of four 15-minute quadrangles, the Pysht, Lake Crescent, Joyce, and Port Angeles, was mapped and the results published as two separate reports (Gower, 1960; Brown and others, 1960). Samples for foraminiferal study were collected during the course of the geologic fieldwork in the summer months from 1952 to 1956. Stratigraphic sections were measured by plane table and telescopic alidade.
Foraminifera indicative of Eocene, Oligocene, and Miocene age were recognized in the northern Olympic Peninsula. Assemblages compare with previously

known faunas from other parts of the west coast and are referred to the Penutian, Ulatisan and marizian stages of Mallory (1959), the Refugian stage of Schenck and Kleinpell (1936), and the Zemorrian and Saucesian stages of Kleinpell (1938).
Detailed studies of the Foraminifera are hampered by their scarcity and poor preservation. Foraminifera are particularly rare in the older part of the sequence but they generally become more plentiful and are better preserved in the younger strata. Many hundreds of samples were taken, but assemblages that are significant of age and environment were obtained from 183
localities. Several methods of disaggregating the samples were
tried, but the kerosene-water method was the most successful. When possible, approximately 150 grams of each sample was washed and all residue that was retained on a 150-mesh screen was examined.
Many members of the U.S. Geological Survey gave assistance on the report. R. D. Brown, Jr., H. D. Gower, and P. D. Snavely, Jr., collected many of the samples, measured some of the sections, and supplied the geologic data upon which parts of this report are based. All photographs of Foraminifera accompanying the report were retouched by Mrs. Mary Wagner.
GEOLOGIC SUMMARY
STRATIGRAPHY
The Soleduck formation of Reagan (1909) is stratigraphically the lowest unit known to crop out in the area and consists primarily of argillite and graywacke with minor amounts of conglomerate, arkosic sandstone, and reddish calcareous argillite in association with volcanic rocks. Within the mapped area, the formation crops out only in the area south of a line extending generally east and west of the south shore of
Gl

G2 SHORTER CONTRIBUTIONS TO GENERAL GEOLOGY

Lake Crescent (pi. 1). The thickness of the formation is unknown, but in the mapped area it is estimated to be about 16,000 feet. However, these rocks are believed to overlie similar rocks to the south, and the formation may therefore be much thicker. Although stratigraphically diagnostic fossils have not been found in the formation, its age is tentatively assigned as early Eocene (Brown and others, 1960). No Foraminifera from this formation were studied in connection with the present report.
In some places the Crescent formation conformably overlies, and in other places it interfingers with, Reagan's Soleduck formation. It consists primarily of pillow basalt, flow breccia, amygdaloidal basalt, and waterlaid tuff with minor amounts of tuffaceous sedimentary rocks and reddish calcareous argillite. In the area mapped by Gower (1960) and by Brown and others (1960) the formation is exposed chiefly in a belt that extends from Round Mountain on the east to Deadmans Hill on the west. It is also exposed 011 the north flank of the Clallam syncline between the mouth of Whiskey Creek and the Elwhat River.
The formation varies considerably in thickness and generally becomes thinner to the west; its greatest thickness in the southeastern part of the mapped area is estimated to be 25,000 feet, and the thinnest section, which is in the extreme western part near Bear Creek, is estimated to be 6,500 feet thick. Foraminifera from 11 localities indicate that the Crescent formation is post-Cretaceous in age and may be, in part at least, as young as middle Eocene.
The Aldwell formation conformably overlies and interfingers with the Crescent formation. It consists mainly of well-indurated marine siltstone with lesser amounts of standstone and volcanic rocks. Discontinuous outcrops of this unit are present south of the Clallam syncline and extend from east to west across the area (pi. 1). The Aldwell formation has a maximum thickness of about 3,000 feet in the vicinity of Lake Aldwell, but it is thinner elsewhere and in some places it is over-
lapped by younger rocks. The age assignment of the formation is based largely on Foraminifera, and they suggest an early late Eocene age.
The Lyre formation as redefined by Brown and others (1956) conformably overlies the Aldwell formation and consists chiefly of conglomerate and sandstone. It crops out in the central part of the mapped area in a belt that extends from about a mile east of the Elwha River to beyond the west border of the mapped area. The thickness varies from more than 3,000 feet in the East Twin River area to only a few feet in some places; in other parts of the area the formation is entirely absent. Al-

though no Foraminifera were obtained from the Lyre formation, assemblages of late Eocene age were collected from the rocks that crop out immediately above and below the formation.
The Twin River formation, as redefined (Brown and Gower, 1958) overlies the Lyre formation and older rocks. Its outcrop belt occupies approximately the northern half of the mapped area and extends beyond both the east and west boundaries. The Twin River formation is divided into a lower, a middle, and an upper member. The lower member is chiefly thinbedded siltstone and sandstone and has a maximum thickness of 7,500 feet and an average thickness of about 2,000 feet. The middle member is primarily massive to thin-bedded siltstone and contains abundant concretions. In places it is estimated to be as much as 5,000 feet thick, and it has an average thickness of about 2,000 feet. The upper member is predominantly massive, semi-indurated mudstone and sandy siltstone but includes some beds of calcareous sandstone. Its thickness is about 3,500 feet in the western part of the area, where its upper contact with the Clallam formation is exposed. Foraminifera from the Twin River formation range in age from late Eocene to late Oligocene or early Miocene.
The Clallam formation is the youngest known Tertiary unit in the area. It generally crops out only in the area north of Last Creek and west of Pillar Point. The formation is composed primarily of poorly sorted gray fine- to medium-grained thick-bedded sandstone with minor amounts of conglomerate and sandy siltstone. It is estimated to be more than 2,500 feet thick. A Miocene age has been assigned to the Clallam formation, on the bases of both the mollusks and Foraminifera.
STEUCTUEE
The principal structural feature of the area is the Clallam syncline. Its axis has been mapped from a point near the mouth of Murdock Creek eastward to the east boundary of the area. It is a west-trending asymmetric fold with steeper dips along its south limb. Smaller east-plunging folds are also present, particularly in the eastern part of the area. The Soleduck formation of Reagon is intensely deformed but no large continuous folds have been traced. Most of the major faults are parallel to the fold axes and trend generally westward. Some of them show stratigraphic displacements of as much as 5,000 feet, A few north-trending faults are also present, particularly in the eastern part of the area. No major faulting is believed to affect the measured sections; therefore, faults are not shown on
plate 1.

FORAMINIFERA FROM THE CRESCENT FORMATION
Two distinctly different types of foraminiferal faunas were found in the Crescent formation. One of these consists almost entirely of planktonic Foraminifera and is known only from lenticular bodies of reddish argillaceous limestone interbedded with volcanic rocks. The other type of fauna consists chiefly of benthonic Foraminifera, and is known to occur only in basaltic sandstone and tuffaceous siltstone in the upper part of the Crescent formation.
PLANKTONIC ASSEMBLAGES
Foraminifera were first reported from the lenticular bodies of reddish argillaceous limestone of the Crescent formation by Pardee (1921, p. 232) and were later mentioned by Park (1946, p. 310). About 50 thin sections of reddish argillaceous limestone from 12 localities were examined in connection with the present study. Five of these localities, f11711 to f11715 (pi. 1), are within the mapped area. Because the fossils could not be separated from the matrix, they were examined only in thin section and were not specifically identified. Most of the Foraminifera are planktonic and are either globigerinids or globorotalids, but none are globotruncanids (pi. 7, figs. 12, 13). The Foraminifera are abundant locally and are commonly concentrated in thin layers. Such concentrations of planktonic Foraminifera as are found in the calcareous rocks of the Crescent formation are rarely found in other Tertiary rocks of the Pacific Northwest.
The abundance of planktonic foraminiferal remains and the lack of benthonic foraminiferal remains in these red argillaceous limestone beds could be indirectly attributed to contemporaneous volcanic activity. The small lenticular bodies of red limestone probably represent periods during which volcanism was locally inactive. Nevertheless volcanism probably continued in nearby areas because volcanic debris is incorporated in the red limestone. It is unlikely that any type of Foraminifera can live in or near areas that are undergoing submarine volcanism. Planktonic Foraminifera can be brought into such an environment by ocean currents, but they probably would die in mass and their tests would be deposited in concentrations as part of the accumulating sediments. Benthonic or nonfloating forms are less likely to be transported in large numbers by ocean currents and therefore in general only planktonic foraminiferal tests would be deposited.
The planktonic assemblages of the Crescent formation are probably post-Cretaceous in age because they consist of globigerinids and globorotalids without any globotruncanids, which are indicative of a Cretaceous age.

BENTHONIC ASSEMBLAGES
In addition to the planktonic fauna, 25 species of benthonic Foraminifera were collected from six other localities, fll7l6 to fll721, in basaltic sandstone and tuffaceous siltstone of the upper part of the Crescent formation (table 1). Although locality f11721 was mapped as Twin Eiver formation by Brown and others (1960), the foraminiferal fauna from there is typical of the Crescent formation; it is therefore regarded here as fauna of the Crescent formation. Locality f11720 at Observatory Point yielded the most complete assemblage. Berthiaume (1938) described several species of orbitoid Foraminifera from this locality. Samples collected during the present study also contain a few orbitoid Foraminifera, but Amphistegina californica Cushman and M. A. Hanna is the most common form in these collections.

The association of orbitoid Foraminifera with many Amphistegina suggests a marine environment with warm, shallow water. Vaughan (1945, p. 69,70) stated:
The Discocyclinidae are warm-, shallow-water organisms. * * * The best temperature conditions [for the Discocyclinidae] would be those between 25° and 31°C. The depth of water in which the Discocyclinidae lived ranged from near or slightly below tide level to perhaps 100 meters. Some forms probably lived in tide pools.
Cushman (1950, p. 300, 301) stated:
This family [Amphistegenidael is largely limited to the Tertiary and Recent oceans. Asterifferina is often abundant on coral reefs and in warm shallow waters of the West Indian region, but less abundant elsewhere. Amphistegina is very abundant in similar conditions and often is present in enormous

G4 SHORTER CONTRIBUTIONS TO GENERAL GEOLOGY

numbers in shoal water, particularly of the Indo-Paciflc. It is frequent in such conditions through the late Tertiary. It is very probable that the genus is limited to about 30 fathoms in its living condition as, like other large Foraminifera, it seems to have commensal algae, the limits of which on account of the penetration of sunlight in the ocean are limited to this same depth.
AGE AND CORRELATION
On the basis of orbitoid Foraminifera, Berthiaume (1938) correlated the Crescent formation exposed at Observatory Point with the orbitoid-bearing Sierra Blanca limestone of Santa Barbara County, Calif., and referred them both to an early middle Eocene age. Mallory (1953) agreed with this correlation, but also suggested a correlation of the Crescent formation with the "Mabury Reef sandstone" and "basal Spiroglyplius sands" at Media Agua Creek in California. He assigned all these units to his Penutian stage, which he regarded as early Eocene (Capay) in age (Mallory, 1959).
The fauna here described from the Crescent formation substantiates a general age assignment of early to early middle Eocene. However, in terms of Mallory's stages the present fauna suggests a Ulatisian age rather than a Penutian age because of the common occurrence of AmpMstegina californica. This species was recorded by Mallory only from his Ulatisian stage (1959, p. 84), which he regarded as middle Eocene and possibly early Eocene in part (Mallory, 1959, p. 77).
In addition to the previously suggested correlations the fauna of the Crescent formation may also be correlated with that described from rocks of Eocene age at Cape Blanco, Oreg. (Bandy, 1944). Practically all the species in the Crescent fauna are represented by closely related forms in the Cape Blanco fauna and five species are regarded as identical.

FORAMINIFERA FROM THE ALDWELL FORMATION
Foraminifera are not abundant in the Aldwell formation, but 49 species from nine localities in different parts of the formation were identified (table 2).
AGE AND CORRELATION
The foraminiferal fauna of the Aldwell formation can best be correlated with Laiming's A-2 zone of the Eocene of California (1940; see also fig. 1, this report). Approximately one-third of the species known from the Aldwell formation (table 2) were recorded by Laiming from his A-2 zone, and many others in the Aldwell formation are either comparable with or similar to species of his A-2 zone. Uvigerina churchi Cushman and Siegfus, U. garzaensis Cushman and Siegfus, Bulimina corrugata Cushman and Siegfus, and B. lirata Cush-

man and Parker, all of which are in the Aldwell, are regarded as characteristic of the A-2 zone. A low position in the A-2 zone is suggested for the Aldwell fauna because it contains such species from Laiming's C zone as Asterigerina crassiformis Cushman and Siegfus, Bifarina nuttalli Cushman and Siegfus, Bolivinopsis directa (Cushman and Siegfus), and Tritaxilina colei Cushman and Siegfus. Laiming (1940) showed that these species, which are common in his C zone, also occur in the lower part of his A-2 zone. The fauna of the Aidwell formation is correlated with the A-2 rather than C-zone faunas because it contains only about one-half
as many species that are known from the C zone as are known from the A-2 zone or higher. This correlation is supported also by stratigraphic evidence because Bzone assemblages which normally separates C-zone and

A-zone assemblages have not been found in the relatively complete section above the Aldwell formation.
Of the faunas noted in Mallory's division of rocks of Eocene age in the California Coast Kanges (1959), the fauna of the Aldwell formation is best compared with that of his Bulimina corrugata zone of the lower part of his Narizian stage. The Aldwell formation contains

AmphimorpMna californica Cushman and McMasters, a form that Mallory indicated is restricted to the upper part of his subjacent Ulatisian stage in California. Therefore a part of the Ulatisian stage may be represented in the Aldwell formation. However, A. californica is found frequently in western Washington and Oregon in association with Foraminifera that compare

G6 SHORTER CONTRIBUTIONS TO GENERAL GEOLOGY

best with those of Mallory's B. corrugata zone and therefore, locally at least, A. californica may not be necessarily indicative of a pre-Narizian age. Faunas resembling those in the Aldwell formation are also found in the Canoas siltstone member of the Kreyenhagen shale (Cushman and Siegfus, 1942) and in the Alhambra formation (Smith, 1957) of California; similar faunas have also been found by the writer in the upper part of the Yamhill formation and the lower parts of the Nestucca and Toledo formations in Oregon, and in the Mclntosh formation of Washington.
PALEOECOLOGY
The similarity of all known assemblages of the Aldwell formation suggests that they probably lived in similar ecological conditions, but conclusions regarding these conditions are necessarily based on considerable supposition. It is possible to be reasonably certain of only a very generalized concept of the environment in which the Foraminifera of the Aldwell formation lived.
Bandy's work (1953) with Eecent Foraminifera from three widely spaced profiles normal to the California coast, off San Diego, Point Arguello, and San Francisco, is the only record of west coast assemblages that are at all similar to the fauna of the Aldwell formation. These assemblages are confined to the deepest and coldest water that was sampled, and are largely from the Point Arguello profile. Several of the species in these Eecent assemblages are similar to species of the Aldwell formation and most of the genera are represented in the fauna of the Aldwell formation. The comparable forms from off the California coast are recorded chiefly from depths between 3,000 feet and 12,000 feet and at temperatures between 15°C and 0°C. The number of individuals with similarities to the Foraminifera of the Aldwell formation generally decreases in shallower and warmer water.
From these generalized comparisons with Bandy's work on Eecent Foraminifera it can only be concluded that some of the Foraminifera in the Aldwell formation probably would have thrived in an environment of relatively deep and cold water.
FORAMINIFERA FROM THE TWIN RIVER FORMATION
Foraminifera are more common in the Twin Eiver formation than in any other formation in the mapped area. Assemblages were found in nearly 400 samples and, of these, approximately 160 samples contained sufficient foraminiferal material to be useful in this study. Foraminifera were collected from three measured sections, the Lyre Eiver (pi. 2), Deep Creek (pi. 3), and on the coast between the mouths of the East

Twin Eiver and Murdock Creek (pi. 4). Many samples were also obtained from isolated outcrops and short sections throughout the mapped extent of the Twin Eiver formation (table 3).
Most samples contain only a few species of Foraminifera and are only sparsely fossiliferous, but because many samples were studied, a sizeable number of species were identified from the formation. Because they are poorly preserved, many of the Foraminifera are tentatively or questionably identified.
AGE AND COBBELATION
Precise correlations and age determination of foraminiferal assemblages in the Twin Eiver formation are hampered by the scarcity and poor preservation of Foraminifera. Furthermore, some species that are known to have different stratigraphic ranges in other areas are found together in parts of the Twin Eiver formation. This apparently anomalous association of species may be due to varied local ecology or perhaps to a reworking of fossils from lower parts of the section ; therefore, age determinations of assemblages from isolated outcrops and correlations of faunas from parts of measured sections are based on assemblages or groups of assemblages rather than on individual species.
Four fauna! divisions are recognized and they are referred to the upper Eocene upper Narizian stage (Mallory, 1959), the Eocene and Oligocene Eefugian stage (Schenck and Kleinpell, 1936), and a lower part and an upper part of the Zemorrian stage (Kleinpell, 1938) of Oligocene or Miocene age.
Foraminifera were collected from all three members of the formation in a measured section in the Lyre Eiver area (pi. 2) ; this section is used as the basic reference for the study of the foraminiferal sequence in the Twin Eiver formation.
LTRE RIVER SECTION
Foraminifera are scarce in the lower member of the Twin Eiver formation in the Lyre Eiver section. Those species which are present, however, suggest a late Eocene age and for the most part they are recorded from the upper part of the Narizian stage of Mallory (1959). Angulogerina hawmi Beck, Cassidulina globosa, Hantken, and Globigerina cf. 6r. yeguaensis Weinzierl and Applin are the most significant species because they are most commonly known from rocks of late Eocene age in other areas.
No Foraminifera were obtained from approximately 1,400 feet of sandy strata in the upper part of the lower member, and the age of the upper part of the lower member could not be determined. Foraminifera indicative of the Eefugian stage make their lowest occurrence in the Lyre Eiver section at the base of the middle

member, immediately above the sandy strata of the upper part of the lower member. Because the highest assemblage of Narizian age and the lowest assemblage of Eefugian age are separated by 1,400 feet of unfossiliferous section, the boundary between these two stages cannot be placed precisely, and therefore, in this report, is questionably placed in the middle of the unfossiliferous part of the section. The following, whose lowest occurrence is above the unfossiliferous sandstone, are the more significant species of the Kefugian stage:
Qulnqueloculina weaveri Rau Nonion cf. N. pompilioides (Fichteland Moll) Bulimina alsatica Cushman and Parker
sculptilis laciniata, Cushman and Parker
Eefugian Foraminifera occur throughout all but approximately the upper 300 feet of the middle member of the Twin Eiver formation in the Lyre Eiver section. Such species as Cancris joaquinensis Smith and Cassidulina glob oso, Hantken occur in the underlying strata of the Narizian stage as well as in the Eefugian stage, but none occur in rocks of the overlying Zemorrian stage; therefore a combination of Narizian and Eefugian species in an assemblage is used as evidence to differentiate faunas of the Eefugian stage from those of the overlying Zemorrian stage. The base of the Zemorrian stage is indicated by the lowest occurrence of Bulimina cf. B. alsatica Cushman and Parker, Cassidulina crassipunctata Cushman and Hobson, and Sphaeroidina variabilis Eeuss. The known occurrence of these species is limited to rocks no older than those assigned to the Zemorrian stage. Additional species that characterize the Zemorrian stage in the Pacific Northwest and which are also present in the Lyre Eiver section are Entosolenia sp., Robulus cf. R. calcar (Linne), and Nonion inciswn (Cushman).
A lower fauna and an upper fauna of the Zemorrian stage are recognized in the Twin Eiver formation, but these two faunas do not necessarily correspond to the lower and upper faunas of the Zemorrian stage of Kleinpell in California. In the Lyre Eiver section the lowest occurrence of the upper fauna of the Zemorrian stage is best indicated by the lowest occurrence of Nonion incisum (Cushman), about 100 feet below the top of the measured section.
DEEP CREEK SECTION
Foraminiferal assemblages from the Deep Creek section suggest an age no older than that of the Zemorrian stage (pi. 3). Foraminifera were not found in the lowest part of the formation in the Deep Creek section, but the lowest assemblages obtained resemble those of the lower part of the Zemorrian stage in the
678833 O 63 3

Lyre Eiver section. No Foraminifera characteristic of either the Eefugian or the Narizian stage were found in the lower assemblages from the Deep Creek section. The occurrence of Cassidulina crassipunctata Cushman and Hobson in the lowest assemblages from the Deep Creek section is significant because this species not only is a common species in the Zemorrian stagte throughout the Pacific Northwest, but its lowest occurrence is in the Lyre Eiver section above the base of the Zemorrian stage. Bulimina cf. B. alsatica Cushman and Parker, although not a common form in the Twin Eiver formation, is found also in the lower assemblages of the Deep Creek section. Its lowest occurrence in the Lyre Eiver section is in the lowest beds assigned to the Zemorrian stage.
The lowest occurrence of Nonion incisum (Cushman) is a few hundred feet below the top of the measured section in Deep Creek and best marks the base of the upper part of the Zemorrian stage in this section. Bulimine.lla subfusiformis Cushman, Bolivina marginata adelaidana Cushman and Kleinpell, and Uvigerina gattowayi Cushman also make their lowest occurrence in the uppermost part of the measured section in Deep Creek, and Eponides man-sfieldi oregonensis Cushman and E. E. and K. C. Stewart was found in several samples in the upper half of the measured section. None of these species are abundant, but they are important because they rarely occur in rocks older than those assigned to the Zemorrian stage. Eecords of U. gallowayi Cushman are confined largely to rocks assigned to the Zemorrian stage.
COAST SECTION
Faunas of the upper part of the Zemorrian stage are well represented in the rocks exposed along the coast between the East Twin Eiver and Murdock Creek, where a thick section of rocks is assigned to the upper part of this stage (pi. 4). Because in the area of this report the coastal section contains the most complete section of rocks assigned to the upper part of the Zemorrian stage, it is regarded as a reference section. Nonion incisum (Cushman) occurs at the base of the coastal section and is found throughout the lower half of this measured section. Elphidium cf. E. minutum (Eeuss) is common in several samples from the upper part of the coastal section, and within the mapped area this species is known only from the upper part of the Zemorrian stage. Cassidulina crassipunctata Cushman and Hobson is present in a number of the samples from the coastal section and is regionally indicative of the Zemorrian stage. A high position in the Zemorrian stage is suggested by the presence of Bulimina alligata Cushman and Laiming, Uvigerina galloivayi Cushman,

G10

and Cassidulinoides sp. because of their common occurrence in the upper part of the Zemorrian stage in other regions of the Pacific Northwest.
ISOIjATED OUTCROPS
Studies of foraminiferal assemblages from the Twin River formation are based chiefly on collections from the three measured sections, but faunas from these sections are augmented by many collections from scattered localities in other parts of the northern Olympic Peninsula. About 300 samples of Foraminifera were collected at random and 65 of these contain fossils that are useful in dating the containing rocks (table 3). The relative age of assemblages from these samples was determined by comparing them with faunas in the measured sections. The 65 samples from scattered localities contain assemblages that range in age from Narizian to late Zemorrian.
Assemblages referred to the Narizian stage are generally of two types. Some are similar to those of the Aldwell formation, but most are similar to assemblages that are believed to be younger than those of the Aldwell formation. However, the younger appearing assemblages do not always occur in the highest stratigraphic position. This anomalous condition may be due to reworking, or it may indicate that the fauna is more indicative of facies than of age.
The following species were not found in the measured sections but are present in assemblages from isolated outcrops. They are at least locally indicative of the Narizian stage and are useful in delimiting its upper extent.
Quinqueloculina g&odspeedi Beck Robulus welchi Church Bulimina corrwgata Cushman and Siegfus Valvulineria aff. V. jacksonensis persimilis Biandy Asterigerina crassiformis Cushman and Siegfus. Cibicides lobatus (d'Orbigny)
Eefugian, lower Zemorrian, and upper Zemorrian assemblages from isolated outcrops do not differ significantly from assemblages from the measured sections.
CHARACTERISTICS OF FAUNAL UNITS
Faunal divisions in the Twin River formation are based primarily on observations of the Foraminifera in the Lyre River section. Additional and substantiating information was obtained from other sections and from isolated outcrops. Particular use was made of the observed range of species, the recorded range in other areas of species present in the Twin River formation, the association of species, and the frequency of occurrence of species.

Many species do not characterize any one faunal unit because they are found throughout the formation. Other species occur so rarely that their significance is not known. Species displaying the greatest significance are listed on figure 2. This figure shows the observed ranges, combination of occurrence, and frequency of occurrence of selected species. The frequency of occurrence of a species is given as a ratio, in percent, of the number of samples in which a given species occurred with respect to the total number of samples obtained from a given stage or stage subdivision. Because many more samples were available in the younger stages, the evidence concerning the limits of these stages and ranges of the species in them is much more reliable than is that concerning the relatively unfossiliferous lower part of the section. Therefore, the calculations shown on figure 2 should be considered only as a broad guide for determining which species are probably the most useful stratigraphically in the Twin River formation.
REGIONAL CORRELATION
Foraminiferal assemblages of the Twin River formation that are comparable to those referred to Mallory's Eocene Narizian stage are known in southwest Washington from an upper part of the Mclntosh formation and parts of the Skookumchuck formation. There they are referred to either the Bulimina scTiencki-Plectofrondicularia cf. P. jenkinsi zone or the Uvigerina cf. U. yazooensis zone (Rau, 1958). In western Oregon similar assemblages are known from the Coaledo formation (Cushman, Stewart, and Stewart, 1947, p. 57-69) and from a lower part of the Toledo formation (Cushman, Stewart, and Stewart, 1949), and they have been observed by the writer from parts of the Nestucca formation. In California similar assemblages are known from the Alhambra formation (Smith, 1957) and the Kreyenhagen shale (Cushman and Siegfus, 1942). Although faunas similar to those in both the lower and upper part of the Kreyenhagen shale are present in the Twin River formation, they do not necessarily occur in the same stratigraphic order as they do in the Kreyenhagen shale. In the Twin River formation these two faunas may represent two different environments or one of them may have been reworked into the Twin River formation from older rocks.
All the above-mentioned west coast assemblages have been referred to Laiming's A-l or his A-2 zone of California. In the standard west coast section (Weaver and others, 1944) these zones are considered late Eocene in age (fig. 1).

SHORTER CONTRIBUTIONS TO GENERAL GEOLOGY

Twin River assemblages that are assigned to the Refugian stage are comparable with Refugian assemblages from the lower and middle part of the Lincoln formation of Weaver (1912) in southwest Washington, where they are referred to the SigmomorpMna schencki and Eponides kleinpelli zones (Ran, 1958). In western Oregon similar Refugian assemblages are known from the Keasey formation and Bastendorff shale (Cushman and Schenck, 1928; Detling, 1946) and they have been observed by the writer from a middle part of the Toledo formation near Waldport, Oreg. Comparable Refugian assemblages of California are known from the Tumey formation (Cushman and Simonson, 1944), the Gaviota formation (Wilson, 1954), and the Wagonwheel formation (Smith, 1956). In terms of the standard west coast section (Weaver and others, 1944), the Refugian stage is "Eo-Oligocene" and Oligocene in age.
Zemorrian assemblages similar to those of the Twin River formation are known from the upper part of Weaver's Lincoln formation in southwest Washington, where they are referred to the Pseudoglandulina aff. P. inflata zone (Rau, 1958), the upper part of the Toledo formation of western Oregon, and the upper part of the San Lorenzo formation of California (Cushman and Hobson, 1935). The Zemorrian stage is generally regarded as "Oligo-Miocene" in age.
PALEOECOLOGY
Only generalized interpretations can be made of the environment in which the Foraminifera of the Twin River formation lived because many of the species are extinct. Conclusions are necessarily based largely on the assumption that fossil species required the same environment as similar living species. Furthermore, data on many living species are incomplete and in some cases controversial. The following generalized interpretations are based on depth and temperature records of living species either identical with or similar to species known from the Twin River formation. Data on the depths and temperatures under which certain Foraminifera are known to live come from several independent records and, in many cases, are too numerous to cite in the discussion. The following references are cited as the major sources of depth and temperature data used in this report: Cushman (1927), Norton (1930), Natland (1933), Kleinpell (1938, p. 11-19, fig. 5), Glaessner (1947, p. 183-194), Parker (1948), Phleger and Parker (1951), Crouch (1952), and Bandy (1953). Particular attention has been given to species that were found in substantial numbers or that occurred persistently throughout thick sections of the formation. Because the occurrence of many species is rare or

sporadic, the number of species used in determining paleoecology is limited.
The Foraminifera of the Twin River formation generally suggest an environment of deep cold water in an open sea. Gyroidina orbicularis planata Cushman is the most common and persistently occurring species known in the formation. Records of this species and similar species show that they prefer cold water at bathyal (600 to 6,000 feet) to abyssal (6,000 feet or more) depths. A similar environment is indicated by the commonly occurring species Uvigerina cocoaensis Cushman, U. garzaemis Cushman and Siegfus, and Cassidwlina erassipunctata Cushman and Hobson. Although it is never found in large numbers, the planktonic form Globigerina is found in places and suggests that the mapped area may have had reasonably good access to an open sea.
Although the evidence is not conclusive, Foraminifera from the lower part of the formation suggest a more shallow environment than do the Foraminifera from the middle and much of the upper part of the formation. Angulogerina and certain species of Cibicides that are similar to species generally recorded from upper bathyal and neritic depths (approximately 2,000 feet to tidal depth) were found in many of the samples from the lower part of the formation. Deepwater species, such as Gyroidina orbicularis planata., also are present. The depth at which the combination of species from the lower part of the Twin River formation lived is therefore estimated as moderate, uppermost bathyal to lower neritic (approximately 1,000 to 300 feet).
Several assemblages from isolated localities within the lower part of the formation are comparable to the cold-, deep-water fauna of the Aldwell formation and may have been reworked into the Twin River formation. However, if they lived during the deposition of the Twin River formation, a depth greater than 1,000 feet may have also existed in local areas during deposition of the lower part of the formation.
Costate Uvigerina., Plectofondicularia, and Nonion pompilioides suggest bathyal depths (6,000 to 600 feet), whereas Comeris and Alabavnina are recorded from cold but shallower water. These Foraminifera occur together in the middle and in much of the upper part of the Twin River formation and suggest bathyal depths, between 6,000 and 1,000 feet,
During the deposition of the uppermost part of the upper member of the Twin River formation, depths probably were decreased but water temperatures remained at least cool. Gyroidina, together with several other forms characteristic of bathyal to lower neritic depths, persist throughout the middle and upper members of the formation. However, Elphidivm cf. E.

FORAMINIFERA, NORTHERN OLYMPIC PENINSULA, WASHINGTON

G13

minutum (Keuss) and Nonion incisum (Cushman) become common in the fauna of the uppermost part of the upper member of the formation. Foraminifera of this type suggest shallow-water conditions. N. incisum suggests cool temperatures in a somewhat sheltered environment. Cool conditions are further suggested by the presence of abundant Cassidulina of the type that is found in cool water of Kecent seas. Although the uppermost part of the formation does contain some deepwater Foraminifera the greater abundance of shallow forms here than in any other part of the formation suggests that the water became more shallow but that the temperature remained cool. Probably in the final stages of deposition of the Twin Kiver formation upper neritic depths became dominant, a prelude to distinct neritic conditions that prevailed during the deposition of the overlying Clallam formation.

FORAMINIFERA FROM THE CLALLAM FORMATION
The known foraminiferal fauna of the Clallam formation consists of 11 species (table 4) collected from three localities (f11891, f11892, f11893) in the northwest part of the mapped area.

Although the fauna is small, it nevertheless is indicative of age. Nonion costiferum makes its lowest occurrence within the area at the base of the Clallam formation. According to Kleinpell (1938, p. 116), N. costiferwn makes its first occurrence in the Saucesian stage of California. This statement is substantiated by observations of the writer in Oregon and in southwestern Washington. In southwestern Washington it makes its lowest occurrence in the Epistom&nella parva zone (Kau, 1958), which occurs largely in strata mapped as the lower part of the Astoria (?) formation (Suavely and others, 1958; Pease and Hoover, 1957). In western Oregon its lowest known occurrence is near the base of the Nye mudstone in the Yaquina Bay area. The foraminiferal faunas of both the lower part of the Astoria(?) formation and the Nye mudstone are considered to be of Saucesian age by the writer. Both

Bolivina advena Cushman and Valvulineria cf. V. depressa Cushman support a Saucesian age even though thav occur in small numbers in the Clallam formation.
The upper age limit of the known foraminiferal fauna of the Clallam formation is not as strongly indicated. Anomalina californiensis makes a rare occurrence at one locality. This species is little known above the lower part of the Saucesian stage. A Saucesian age for at least the lower part of the Clallam formation is further suggested by stratigraphic evidence because in places the Clallam formation rests conformably on Zemorrian age strata of the Twin Kiver formation (Gower, 1960). Foraminifera were not collected from the uppermost part of the Clallam formation and therefore the age of that part of the formation was not determined on the basis of Foraminifera. The Saucesian stage of the standard west coast section (Weaver and others, 1944) is regarded as "Oligo-Miocene" in age.
The small foraminiferal fauna of the Clallam formation is also suggestive of the environment in which it lived, probably a shallow, cool, and somewhat sheltered sea. Nonion costiferum is common in samples from the three localities. Kleinpell (1938, p. 15; and table 1) inferred that this species is common in neritic waters and in areas sheltered from current action. Furthermore, Kleinpell (1938, fig. 5) considered the genus Nonion to be a cool-temperate-water form. Elphidium cf. E. minutum, is also common in the Clallam fauna. Species similar to it are almost always found at shallow depths (Phleger and Parker, 1951, pt. 2, p. 10). Eponides mansfieldi oregonensis occurred at all three Clallam localities. This species is similar to E. hannai, which Phleger and Parker (1951, pt. 1, p. 51) indicated is confined to depths of less than 100 meters in the northwest part of the Gulf of Mexico. Gyroidina orbicularis planata, which occurred at one locality in the Clallam formation, is the only conflicting evidence for a shallow depth, because records of this species are usually from greater depths. However, its known preference for cold water suggests cool-water conditions as suggested by Nonion. The remaining species from the Clallam formation occur too rarely, or their recorded environments are too varied, to be suggestive of the probable environment.
SUMMARY OF PALEOECOLOGIC INTERPRETATIONS BASED ON FORAMINIFERA
The abundance of planktonic Foraminifera known from parts of the Crescent formation suggests that sometime following the Cretaceous period and prior to late early Eocene or middle Eocene time, open-sea conditions probably prevailed in the area. The absence of benthonic forms in these assemblages suggests that

G14

SHORTER CONTRIBUTIONS TO GENERAL GEOLOGY

the environment was unfavorable for the existence of bottom-dwelling Foraminifera. The distribution of planktonic Foraminifera is largely dependent upon ocean currents; therefore, their presence in the Crescent formation suggests that they were brought into the area even though conditions were not continuously favorable for their existence. The concentrations of planktonic foraminiferal remains in certain places in the formation suggest periodic annihilation. Conditions for mass destruction of planktonic Foraminifera could have resulted from extensive submarine volcanic activity that is indicated by the numerous pillow basalt flows in the Crescent formation.
In late early to middle Eocene time shallow protected bays existed at least during the deposition of the upper part of the Crescent formation, as is indicated by the presence of benthonic Foraminifera that required shallow, warm, clear water. These conditions may have resulted from the extrusion of volcanic material to the extent that the seas became shallow and in places broken by barrier reefs or islands.
In the early part of late Eocene time the area probably underwent considerable subsidence, because all foraminiferal assemblages known from the overlying Aldwell formation indicate a cool, deep-water environment. This postulation is supported by the almost total absence of megafossils and the fine-grained nature of the sediments of the formation.
The absence of Foraminifera in the overlying Lyre formation may be due to a rapid deposition of the coarse clastic sediments of this formation. Such sediments most probably were deposited under turbulence which, in turn, would have created muddy seas, a condition unfavorable for most Foraminifera.
Following the deposition of the Lyre formation and during late Eocene time, the lower part of the Twin Eiver formation was probably deposited at various depths, but generally in a moderately shallow sea. If the Aldwell-like assemblages, found in a few places in the lower part of the Twin River formation, were not reworked, considerable depths existed locally in the area during that time. However, generally the Foraminifera of the lower part of the Twin River formation suggest moderately shallow depths, uppermost bathyal to lower neritic.
By Refugian time (late Eocene or early Oligocene), deepening of the sea continued, although in places, particularly to the west, moderately shallow depths continued to prevail.
Maximum depths of deposition for the Twin River formation were probably attained throughout most of the mapped area during the early part of Zemorrian time (late Oligocene or early Miocene). The Forami-

nifera suggest that the sea was shallowest in the western part of the area but that it gradually deepened during Zemorrian time. By the close of Zemorrian time the sea rapidly became more shallow.
The much greater thickness and generally coarser grained nature of the Twin River formation in the vicinity of Deep Creek, as compared to the formation in the Lyre River area, suggest that a source of sediments may have been closer to the Deep Creek area than to the Lyre River area. Furthermore, combined information on the paleoecology and age inferred by Foraminifera suggests that shallow conditions existed for a longer period of time in the Deep Creek area than they did in the Lyre River area.
In the Deep Creek section, foraminiferal information is available only from the middle member, a lithologic unit primarily of bedded siltstone and sandstone. Foraminifera indicate that all but the upper 500 feet of this member is early Zemorrian in age. The upper 500 feet is late Zemorrian in age. In the Lyre River section to the east all the Foraminifera of the middle member, except those from the upper 300 feet of the member, are Refugian in age. Foraminifera from the upper 300 feet of the middle member and those from almost all the upper member in the Lyre River section are of early Zemorrian age. The upper member of the formation is chiefly mudstone. Therefore, the siltstone and sandstone of the middle member were deposited during the Refugian time in the Lyre River area, whereas in the Deep Creek area their deposition continued throughout much of Zemorrian time to the west. The sediments of the middle member not only were deposited for a longer period of time in the Deep Creek area, but their greater thickness in a unit of time indicates they also accumulated more rapidly there than they did to the east in the Lyre River area.
These comparisons show that, although the three members of the Twin River formation maintain a stratigraphic sequence, the geologic age as well as the amount of time represented by any one member can vary throughout the mapped area.
Limited foraminiferal evidence indicates that during Saucesian time (early Miocene) at least part of the Clallam formation was deposited under shallow, coolwater conditions in a protected environment. Coal beds in the upper part of the Clallam fonnation indicate that other parts of the formation are continental deposits.

The frequent use of qualifiers such as "cf." and "aff." has been necessary because many forms are represented by few specimens and many specimens are poorly preserved.

This species is characterized by its elongate shape, rounded cross section, and a slightly protruding, round aperture with a thin tooth extending from the base. Although it is uncommon in the mapped area, it is useful when present because it indicates a late Eocene age in western Washington. It is known from the Cowlitz formation (Beck, 1943), the Skookumchcuk formation, and the upper part of the Mclntosh formation of southwestern Washington (Rau, 1958). It occurs in the lower part of the Twin Eiver formation in the northern Olympic Peninsula.

Quinqueloculina weaveri differs from Q. goodspeedi in that its cross section is more angular, the apertural face slopes, and the base of the aperture is flattened. This species,usually occurs in rocks of the Refugian stage, but it is also found in the northern Olympic Peninsula in rocks assigned to the Zemorrian stage.

Angular areas are present on the periphery of some specimens of Robulus where the periphery is joined by the sutures. Blunt spines even are formed at these angular areas on some specimens. All specimens displaying these features are tentatively and in a broad sense referred to R. calcar (Linne). This general form seems to be a good marker fossil for rocks of the Zemorrian stage in western Washington and Oregon because it is recorded only from rocks of this age in southwestern Washington (Rau, 1958) and is known from the rocks of the same age in western Oregon. It occurs in the upper part of the Twin River formation in the northern Olympic Peninsula.

only from rocks of late Eocene age. California records are also all from strata of late Eocene age (Mallory, 1959, p.143).

Family NONIONIDAE
Genus NONION Montfort, 1808
Nonion costiferum (Cushman)
Plate 5, figure 5

This species is common in all samples from the Clallam formation but was not found in any of those below the formation. It is recorded from many localities of Miocene age in California, Oregon, and Washington (Kleinpell, 1938). The lowest occurrence of Nonion costiferum generally coincides with the base of the Saucesian stage. Therefore its lowest occurrence in the northern Olympic Peninsula at the base of the Clallam formation suggests a Saucesian age for at least the lower part of the formation.

Many variations are shown among the specimens that are referred to this species. Some of the more conspicuous variations are in the amount of flaring of the latter chambers, the height relative to breadth, the thickness, and the amount of depression of sutures. Eegardless of these variations, all specimens fall within the limits of the species sensu lato.
Nonion incisum is a useful fossil in the northern Olympic Peninsula because there it is known to occur only in the upper part of the Zemorrian stage and the Saucesian stage where it is reasonably frequent.

Variations of the species have been recorded from California and Oregon from rocks referred to the upper part of Kleinpell's Zemorrian stage and to the lower part, of his Luisian stage (Kleinpell, 1938, p. 146, 232, 233).

Forms displaying bilateral symmetry and a broad final chamber are tentatively referred to Nonion pompilioides (Fichtel and Moll). (See Cushman, 1939, p. 19, pi. 5, figs. 9-12.) Most of the specimens came from rocks of the Zemorrian stage; however, a few specimens were also found in rocks of the Refugian stage.

Genus ELFHIDIUM Montfort, 1808
Elphidium cf. E. minutum (Reuss)
Plate 5, figure 8
The description of this species given by Cushman (1939, p. 40) agrees closely with that of a number of specimens from the upper part of the rock sequence of the northern Olympic Peninsula. However, his illustrations (Cushman, 1939, pi. 10, figs. 22-25) all display coarser retral processes than are developed on the specimens under question. Inasmuch as Cushman stated that the retral processes are very slightly developed, they may have been overemphasized in his illustrations.
Elphidium cf. E. minutum was found only in roc£s assigned to the upper part of the Zemorrian stage and the Saucesian stage within the mapped area. It is also recorded from rocks of Zemorrian and Saucesian age in southwestern Washington (Rau, 1951, 1958).

Plectofrondicularia gratilis Smith, 1956, California Univ. Dept. Geol. Sci. Bull., v. 32, no. 2, p. 93, pi. 12, figs. 2-5.
The Tertiary sequence of Washington, Oregon, and California contains a strain of Plectofrondicularia which displays considerable variation in form. The variant most significant stratigraphically was originally described from the Bastendorff shale of Oregon and called P. packardi Cushman and Schenck (1928). Subsequently a more common and widely distributed variant was described from the Tumey formation of California and referred to P. packardi multilineata Cushman and Simonson (1944). Studies of the faunas of the Tertiary rocks of Oregon and Washington strongly suggest that there, at least, P. packardi packardi does not occur above the Kefugian stage and is found only occasionally in the underlying Narizian stage. However, P. packardi multilineata occurs throughout rocks of late Eocene, Oligocene, and possibly early Miocene age. Many variants of the strain displaying a complete gradation from one form to another were found in samples from the northern Olympic Peninsula. Those referred to P. packardi packardi have few short and coarse costae which are sometimes curved on the initial chamber. The remaining forms of various shapes with varying number of straight and longer costae are referred to P. packardi multilineata. Certain variances in the latter group have been examined for stratigraphic value and have been found to be of no importance. Tlierefore, they are all grouped under the single name P. packardi multilineata in this study. P. gracilis Smith is within this group and is placed in synonomy with P. packardi multilineata in the report.

This species occurs rarely in the rocks of the northern Olympic Peninsula, only in the upper part of the Twin Eiver formation. Records of Buliminella subfusifoi^mis in Washington, Oregon, and California strongly suggest that it does not occur in rocks older than those of the Zemorrian stage. In southwest Washington it is recorded from the Pseudoglandulina aff. P. inflata zone and the Epistominella parva zone (Eau, 1958) of the Zemorrian and Saucesian stages, respectively. It is known in Oregon from the Astoria formation (Cushman, Stewart,, and Stewart, 1947) and the Nye mudstone. In California, Kleinpell (1938) recorded this species from the lower part of the Zemorrain stage to the lower part of the Delmontain stage.

The present specimens are small, tend to be triangular in cross section, display the greatest breadth slightly above the middle, and have numerous longitudinal costae extending continuously over all but the last chamber. These features characterize Bulimina corrugata as described by Cushman and Siegfus.
This species was found locally in the Crescent and Aldwell formations and the lower part of the Twin Eiver formation. In southwest Washington it is recorded from the Bulimina cf. B. jacksonensis zone and the Uvigerina cf. U. yazooensis zone of Mclntosh formation (Eau, 1956,1958). In Oregon it has been observed by the writer in samples from the Umpqua formation, lower part of the Toledo formation, Nestucca formation, Yamhill formation, and the Elkton siltstone member of the Tyee formation. The highest occurrence of B.

A few costate specimens of Bulimina are relatively broad with respect to length and taper rapidly to a sharp initial end. They compare well in all respects to B. lirata Cushman and Parker, which, according to Mallory (1959, p. 85), is known from his Penutian, Ulatisian, and Narizian stages of the upper part of the Eocene sequence of California.
This species has not been recorded previously from Washington or Oregon but has been observed by the writer in samples from the Umpqua formation and rocks of probable equivalent age in Oregon. In the northern Olympic Peninsula it was found in a few samples from both the Aldwell formation and the lower part of the Twin River formation.

A small, comparatively broad Bulimina with jagged costae over all chambers except those of the last whorl compares well with the illustrations and description of B. alsatica Cushman and Parker. This species is known from rocks of Oligocene age in France and Germany and from rocks of Miocene age in Italy, Spain, and Florida. It has also been tentatively recorded from rocks of Oligocene age in Washington (Rau, 1958). In the Twin River formation it occurs most frequently in

rocks that are assigned to the Zemorrian stage. It also makes a rare occurrence in the Refugian part of the Twin River formation.

Bulimina schencki Beck (1943) was originally described from the Cowlitz formation of southwest Washington and has been recorded since from the Skookumchuck formation of the same area (Rau, 1958). In California Mallory (1959) recorded this species from the upper part of his Ulatisian stage and his Narizian stage. It has been found in the Poway conglomerate, Cozy Dell formation, Point of Rocks formation, and the type Tejon formation (Mallory, 1959).

This large Bulimina with continuous, jagged, and platelike costae was found only in strata of the Twin River formation that are referred to the Refugian stage. It was originally described from beds at Waldport, Oreg., which are regarded as Zemorrian in age by the writer. It is also known in Oregon from the Bastendorff shale and the Keasey formation (Cushman and Schenck, 1928) of Refugian age. The southwestern Washington occurrences are from the Sigmomorphina schencki zone of the Refugian stage and the Bulimina schencki-Plectofrondicularia cf. P. jenkinsi zone of latest Eocene age (Rau, 1958). Although the species is found occasionally both above and below the Refugian stage, its occurrence is most frequent in the Refugian stage.

This species is rare in the present material. It occurs only in the uppermost part of the Twin River formation and the Clallam formation. It is known in southwest Washington from the Epistominella parva zone (Rau, 1958), and in Oregon it is recorded from the Astoria formation (Cushman, Stewart, and Stewart, 1947). The species is known in California from rocks ranging in age from that of the Saucesian stage to the Mohnian

stage (Kleinpell, 1938). In the northern Olympic Peninsula the presence of Bolivina advena in the rocks suggests a relatively high stratigraphic position in the local Tertiary sequence.

The spinelike extension of the chambers at the periphery and limbate sutures are well developed on the present specimens. This form occurs in rocks of Zemorrian age in the Twin River formation. In western Washington and Oregon it occurs only in strata that are no older than those of the Zemorrian stage. It is recorded from the Pseudoglandulina aff. P. inftata zone and Epistominella parva zone of southwestern Washington (Rau, 1958). In Oregon it is known from the Astoria formation (Cushman, Stewart, and Stewart, 1947) and it has been observed by the writer from the Nye mudstone, the Yaquina formation, and the upper part of the Toledo formation. Records of this variety in California are largely from beds of Saucesian age (Kleinpell, 1938, p. 277).

Mallory, 1959, Lower Tertiary biostratigraphy of the California Coast Ranges: Am. Assoc. Petroleum Geologists, p. 206, pi. 17, fig. 6.
The irregular longitudinal costae broken between chambers and the blunt initial end are characteristic features of Uvigerina churchi that are well shown on the specimens from the northern Olympic Peninsula. This species occurs in more than half of the assemblages of the Aldwell formation and is questionably identified from several samples from the lower part of the Twin River formation. U. churchi has not been recorded previously from either Washington or Oregon but a similar form referred to as U. cf. U. yazooensis Cushman is recorded from the zone of the same name of southwestern Washington (Rau, 1958). The latter form differs from U. churchi in that the test is more elongate and the costae are higher and more distinct. In California, U. churchi is known from strata that are referred to Laiming's A-2 zone (Laiming, 1940), and Mallory (1959) showed the occurrence of this form in his Narizian stage.

This well-known species occurs in the northern Olympic Peninsula only in strata of Refugian age. Because of its relatively frequent occurrence in the Twin River formation and because of its known restricted occurrence in rocks of the Refugian stage in other areas, it is a useful species for identifying rocks of Refugian age in the northern Olympic Peninsula. In southwest Washington Uvigerina cocoaensis is recorded from the Sigm-omorphina scTiencki zone (Rau, 1958), and in Oregon it is known from the Bastendorff shale and the Keasey formation (Cushman and Schenck, 1928; Detling, 1946). Records of the species in California are from theTumey formation (Cushman and Simonson, 1944), the Gaviota formation (Wilson, 1954), and the Wagonwheel formation (Smith, 1956). In all cases the containing beds have been regarded as Refugian in age.

This species is restricted to a few samples from the upper part of the Twin River formation. Although uncommon in the area, its presence high in the local sequence is in accordance with previous records of Uvigerina gallowayi which are from beds of the Zemorrian stage only. In southwestern Washington it is known from beds that are assigned to the Zemorrian stage (Rau, 1958). There are no records of the species from Oregon but the writer has observed it in the Bastendorff shale. In California it is recorded from beds mapped largely as the Vaqueros formation or Temblor formation (Kleinpell, 1938, p. 294).

This species is one of the more .frequently occurring forms in the Tertiary sequence of the northern Olympic Peninsula. It is found throughout the Aidwell and Twin River formations. The shape and size of the test are noticeably varied but these variations are gradational and show no stratigraphic significance. Several described species probably are within the range of variance of the present specimens, but no stratigraphic usefulness is gained by dividing the group and therefore in this report they are all referred to one species, Uvigerina garzaensis. U. garzaensis has very little stratigraphic significance but its presence does suggest a general environment of cool water at substantial depths.
In California U. garzaensis is recorded largely from rocks of late Eocene age. It is known from the Coaledo and Bastendorff formations of Oregon (Detling, 1946) and has been observed by the writer in many other assemblages from Oregon of late Eocene age. It is recorded from southwestern Washington from rocks of the same age (Rau, 1958).

Specimens from the northern Olympic Peninsula compare in detail with Beck's description and illustration of Angulogerina Jiannai. Although individuals of this species are never found in abundance in any one sample, it occurs frequently in the rocks of Eocene age within the area, particularly in the lower part of the Twin River formation.
The species was originally described from the Cowlitz formation (Beck, 1943). It has since been recorded from the Bulimina schencki-Plectofrondicularia cf. P. jenMnsi zone of late Eocene age in southwest Washington (Rau, 1958) and from beds of late Eocene age in the Helmick Hills of western Oregon (Cushman, Stewart and Stewart, 1947).

Rau, 1951, Jour. Paleontology, v. 25, no. 4, p. 447, pi. 66, figs. 4-6.
Gyroidina orbicularis planata is common in much of the Tertiary sequence of the northern Olympic Peninsula. It occurs in several samples from the Aldwell formation, is well represented in most of the samples from the Twin River formation, and is present in one sample from the Clallam formation. Its long range makes it of little stratigraphic use. However, ecologically it is useful, because it suggests substantial depths in cool to cold water. G. orbicularis planata is recorded from rocks of late Eocene age and rocks that are referred to the Refugian and Zemorrian stages in southwestern Washington (Rau, 1958). Although not recorded from western Oregon, it has been observed by the writer from many parts of the Tertiary sequence there. In California, it is recorded from rocks of late Eocene age (Mallory, 1959).

The outstanding features of Eponides mansfieldi oregonensis are the papillate umbonal area on the ventral surface, the depressed sutures on the same surface, and the slightly scalloped periphery.
In the northern Olympic Peninsula its lowest occurrence is in the lower part of the Zemorrian stage but it occurs most frequently in the upper part of the Zemorrian stage. The known occurrence of this form in southwestern Washington is in the Pseudoglandulina aff. P. inflata and Epistominella parva zones, which are assigned to the Zemorrian and Saucesian stages, respec-

tively (Ran, 1958). It is recorded from western Oregon from the Astoria formation (Cushman, Stewart, and Stewart, 1947) and has also been observed by the writer from the Nye mudstone, the Yaquina formation, and the upper part of the Toledo formation. Associated Foraminifera suggest that the Nye mudstone is Saucesian in age, whereas the Yaquina formation and the upper part of the Toledo formation are of Zemorrian age. The known occurrence of E. mansfieldi oregonensis is therefore in rocks no older than the Zemorrian age.

Specimens from the northern Olympic Peninsula compare in all respects with the illustrations and description of Cancris joaquinensis Smith. The species was originally described by Smith (1956) from the Wagonwheel formation of California, which he assigned to the Refugian stage. Smith indicated that the species also was observed from the Bastendorff and Keasey formations of Oregon. In the northern Olympic Peninsula area the highest occurrence of C. joaquinensis is in the Refugian stage, but its lowest occurrence in the area is in rocks of late Eocene age. This upper Eocene occurrence extends the lower range of the species, but its highest occurrence in the Refugian stage in northern Olympic Peninsula is useful for differentiating faunas of a pre-Zemorrian age from those of Zemorrian age.

All specimens are from the Crescent formation and there they are the most common benthonic form known in the formation. Although they are all poorly preserved, a composite of the features that can be observed on various specimens constitutes Amphistegina californica as described by Cushman and Hanna (1927).
Amphistegina californica was originally described from sea cliffs near La Jolla, Calif. Mallory (1959) recorded the species only from his Ulatisian stage. There are no records of this species from either Oregon or Washington, but the writer has observed forms which may be species in the Umpqua formation of western Oregon and in rocks in southwestern Washington tentatively assigned to the Crescent formation by Pease and Hoover (1957).

Smith (1956) described this species from the Wagonwheel formation of California and also noted its occurrence in the Bastendorff shale of Oregon. The Refugian stage is represented in both of these formations. In the northern Olympic Peninsula Alabamina kernensis is found in rocks of Refugian and pre-Refugian ages in the Twin River formation and in the underlying Aldwell formation of Eocene age. These occurrences extend the records of A. kernensis into rocks of late Eocene age, but the Refugian stage remains the upper limit of its known occurrence.

Considerable variation in form is shown among individuals placed under this species, but they are within the limit of variation of the description of Cushman and Hobson (1935)- Cassidulina crassipunctata is one of the more common species in rocks of Zemorrian age in the Twin River formation. Its lowest occurrence is useful for determining the base of the Zemorrian stage. This species has been tentatively referred to in southwestern Washington (Ran, 1958) where it also occurs in rocks of the Zemorrian stage.
The species was described from the type San Lorenzo formation of California (Cushman and Hobson, 1935) and has since been recorded in California from the Vaqueros and Temblor formations. All records of the species are from rocks of the Zemorrian stage.

Some individuals are decidedly asymmetric, whereas others are nearly bilaterally symmetric and are difficult to differentiate from Nonion pompilioides. In most cases the test of A. californiensis is thinner than that of N. pompilioides.
In both the northern Olympic Peninsula and southwestern Washington the occurrence of A. californiensis is confined to the Refugian and Zemorrian stages. California records of this species are from rocks of the Refugian stage (Smith, 1956), Zemorrian stage, and lower part of the Saucesian stage (Kleinpell, 1938).

The present specimens display high convexity of the ventral side and low convexity of the dorsal side; they have a coarsely perforate surface, and the early whorls are obscured on the dorsal side. These features are characteristic of Cibicides martinezensis malloryi. In the northern Olympic Peninsula this form makes one appearance in beds of Refugian age but all other occurrences are in rocks of late Eocene age in the lower part of the Twin River formation and the Aldwell formation. C. martinezensis malloryi was described from the Alhambra formation of California (Smith, 1957). Specimens similar to this form have also been observed by the writer from both the Umpqua and Tyee formations of Oregon.
Figured specimen (USNM 627022) from USGS locality f11799.
