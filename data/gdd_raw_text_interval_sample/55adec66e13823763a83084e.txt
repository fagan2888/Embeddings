GEONAMES Data Base of Geologic Names of the United States Through 1988

The GEONAMES data base is an annotated index lexicon of formal geologic nomenclature of the United States, its territories and possessions. The data base was compiled by R. W. Swanson, M. L. Hubert, G. W. Luttrell, and V. M. Jussen and was published in 1981 as Geologic names of the United States through 1975: U.S. Geological Survey Bulletin 1535, 643 p. This version of GEONAMES has been updated based on information published through 1988, and it contains approximately 30,000 records relating to more than 18,000 names.
Data are entered in 10 fixed fields containing up to 123 characters of information for each record. The fields are: 1. location of unit; 2. geologic age; 3. name of unit; 4. USGS usage; 5. lithology; 6. geologic province; 7. thickness at type section; 8. location of type section; 9. lexicon reference;
10. unique identifier.

DEFINITION OF FIELDS. The formats and codes used in the fields are explained below. Fields 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9 are used only once for each unit as this information pertains to its type locality and original reference.

FIELD 1. LOCATION. The U.S.. Postal Service 2-letter abbreviations are used to identify the State, territory, or possession in which the unit is located.

FIELD 3. NAME. The geologic name consists of a geographic name combined with a rank or descriptive term. A comma separates the two parts of the name. If a unit is part of a higher ranking unit, the name of that unit follows in parentheses. A slash (/) preceding a name indicates a violation of the North American Stratigraphic Code (for instance, a name may have been used previously in the same area, or a rank term may have been used improperly or may have been omitted)
FIELD <*. USGS USAGE, A "U" is entered in this field if the line entry is based on usage in a USGS report.

FIELD 5. LITHQLQGY. The principal lithology of the unit at the type section is given. If lithology is indicated by the unit name, the
lithology column may be blank.

FIELD 7. THICKNESS. Thickness at the type section, in meters, rounded to the second significant figure is shown. Where this information is unavailable, the maximum thickness is given, if known.

FIELD 8. TYPE LOCALITY. One of nine parts of the State in which the type section, locality, or area of a unit is located. Each State is divided into nine parts, designated NW, NC, NE, UIC, C, EC, SUI, SC, SE, by dividing its maximum latitudinal and longitudinal dimensions by three. Canada and Mexico are designated by CAN AND MEX .

FIELD 9. REFERENCE. The letters A through H refer to the volume of the lexicon of Geologic Names in which a name was first descr ibed:

FIELD 10. UNIQUE IDENTIFIER. A unique identifier consisting of a four-letter mnemonic plus a two-digit number is assigned to each record. It is used for recalling records for updating and for sorting. The mnemonic is derived from the geographic part of the name using a method devised by the AAPG Committee on Standard Stratigraphic Coding. English articles and prepositions are deleted first; those in foreign languages are retained. The first letter of each remaining word is retained. Names beginning with Me, 0*, De, or Van are treated as two words. Letters are then deleted, from right to left, in the following order until four remain: a, e, i, o, u, w, h, y, one of each double, t, n, s, r, 1, d, c, m, f, g, p, k, b, v, x, j, q, 2. All the records for each name have the same mnemonic but different numbers.

DATA RETRIEVAL

GEQNAMES is now available on IBM-compatible 5 1/^-in diskettes from Open File Services. The files were first sorted by state and then downloaded onto 16 diskettes, each one generally containing data for two or more adjacent states. Users may purchase one or more diskettes, combine the states, or use them individually, depending upon their specific needs and computer equipment. These state files can be loaded into and manipulated with almost any database management software. (Records are loaded into dBase, for instance, using the command "append from [file name] sdf . " ) In setting up fields, use the following parameters.

FIELD NAME

SIZE

CState3 CAgeH C Slash 3 CName3 CUse3 CLith3 CProv3 CThick3 CTypLoc3 CRefH CID3

C13 C623
C53 Cl<+3
C63 C103
-C73

The slash has been placed in a separate field in order to simplify sorting .

GEONAMES is also available on 8-track magnetic tape from NTIS. Units for the entire nation are listed alphabetically on the tape. This media may be more suitable for users interested in geologic names af the United States as a whole.

Following is a breakdown by diskette? showing the states, number of records, and the approximate size of the files. An asterisk indicates states included in more than one geographic grouping. Each diskette also contains the document, Geointro, a users guide to GEQNAMES.
