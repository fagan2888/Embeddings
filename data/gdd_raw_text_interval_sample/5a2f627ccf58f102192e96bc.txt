abstract
The six largest known impact craters of the last 250 Myr (!70 km in diameter), which are capable of causing signiﬁcant environmental damage, coincide with four times of recognized extinction events at 36 (with 2 craters), 66, and 145 Myr ago, and possibly with two provisional extinction events at 168 and 215 Myr ago. These impact cratering events are accompanied by layers in the geologic record interpreted as impact ejecta. Chance occurrences of impacts and extinctions can be rejected at conﬁdence levels of 99.96% (for 4 impact/extinctions) to 99.99% (for 6 impact/extinctions). These results argue that several extinction events over the last 250 Myr may be related to the effects of large-body impacts.

1. Introduction
The Cretaceous/Paleogene boundary (66 Myr ago) has often been described as the only extinction boundary with documented independent geologic evidence of impact (e.g., Hallam, 2004). A closer look at the geologic data shows that this is not the case. We chose the six largest known well-dated impact craters (!70 km in diameter) of the last 250 Myr (Table 1), and compared their ages with extinction events (Table 2) and independent geologic evidence for impact. We chose craters larger than 70 km in diameter because this has been suggested as the approximate cutoff of crater size capable of causing an extinction event that stands above background extinctions (e.g., Raup, 1990; Toon et al., 1997). For all of the six largest craters, the crater age overlaps that of a recognized extinction event (here we include the provisional minor event at the Bajocian-Bathonian boundary at 168 Myr, and also provisionally, the newly discovered Adamanian-Revueltian event in the midNorian at w215 Myr ago). At least ﬁve out of six large craters match times of stratigraphic evidence of impacts (iridium, shocked quartz

and/or microtektites or microspherules). In the sixth case, the Morokweng structure (!70 km diameter) at the Jurassic/Cretaceous boundary, the correlative impact debris layer is most likely related to the smaller roughly coeval Mjølnir crater (40 km in diameter). These impacts and their correlative stratigraphic signatures of impacts, and biologic events are discussed below.
2. Impact craters and stratigraphic evidence of impacts
2.1. Chesapeake Bay and Popigai impacts
The Chesapeake Bay crater (85 km in diameter, 35.3 Æ 0.1 Myr ago) and the Popigai crater (100 km in diameter, 35.7 Æ 0.2 Myr ago), produced tektite/microtektite (Chesapeake) and microspherule (Popigai) strewn ﬁelds with wide distributions (e.g., Poag et al., 1994, 2004; Koeberl et al., 1996; Bottomley et al., 1997; Gohn et al., 2008; Glass and Simonson, 2013). Two other well-dated smaller craters have ages that fall in the same interval (Wanapitei, 37.2 Æ 1.2 Myr ago and Mistastin, 36.4 Æ 4 Myr ago, both in Canada; Impact Data Base, 2016).
In the Global Stratigraphic Section and Point (GSSP) for the Eocene/Oligocene boundary at Massignano, Italy (Montanari et al., 1993), three iridium anomalies occur within an interval of enhanced extraterrestrial 3He over a span of about 2.2 million years in the Late Eocene (Farley et al., 1998; Bodiselitsch et al., 2004).

dinoﬂagellates about 60 kyr after the Popigai impact event layer, and the change in plankton may correlate with one of the small iridium anomalies seen at Massignano.
2.2. Chicxulub impact
There is considerable stratigraphic evidence around the globe for the Chicxulub impact (66 Myr ago; 180 km diameter) in the Yucatan. A layer enriched in iridium, and with shocked quartz, stishovite, microtektites and microspherules with Ni-rich spinel crystals, is found at the Cretaceous/Paleogene boundary worldwide, in marine and non-marine deposits (Schulte et al., 2010; Glass and Simonson, 2013). The impact layer is the time equivalent of the global end-Cretaceous mass extinction (66 Myr ago) (Renne et al., 2013).

extended 3He anomaly has been interpreted as the result of an unusual inﬂux of interplanetary dust particles, potentially shed from increased numbers of comets (a comet shower) (Farley et al., 1998), or of asteroids passing through the inner solar system (Schmitz et al., 2015). The lowermost Ir anomaly (at 5.6 m in the outcrop), is identiﬁed with the Popigai impact, and contains shocked quartz and microspherules containing Ni-rich spinels.
Another iridium anomaly occurs at 6.2 m at Massignano (just 60 cm higher in the section, equivalent to about 20,000 years at Massignano), which might be related to the Chesapeake impact crater and microtektite strewn ﬁeld, but thus far no microtektites have been discovered at this level in Massignano. The youngest of the three iridium spikes (at 10.3 m, or about 150 kyr after the lowermost Ir peak) coincides with a 3He peak about 6 times higher than background, making it an interesting candidate for further analyses for impact signatures (Bodiselitsch et al., 2004).
Biotic changes seem to have begun in the middle Eocene, and according to Sepkoski’s (2002) genus data (with rarefaction), marine species apparently suffered a w35% extinction from Late Eocene through Early Oligocene time. Six species of planktonic radiolarians went extinct at the same time as the microtektite layer from the Chesapeake impact (Sanﬁlippo et al., 1985). The period of time bracketing the microtektite event(s) seems to have been associated with 1 to 2 million years of stepwise events of faunal turnover in calcareous plankton, with a total Eocene/Oligocene turnover involving >60% of the plankton population (Keller, 1986). Bodiselitsch et al. (2004) reported a warm pulse in that same interval superimposed on a general Late Eocene cooling. Other researchers found evidence of a global cooling in the immediate aftermath of the two impacts (Glass and Simonson, 2013). Coccioni et al. (2000) found signiﬁcant changes in calcareous plankton and

2.3. Morokweng/Mjølnir impacts
The large !70 km diameter Morokweng crater in South Africa has been dated at 145 Æ 0.8 Myr ago, close to the accepted time of the Jurassic/Cretaceous boundary (145 Myr ago; Hart et al., 1997; Reimold et al., 2002). Two other well-dated craters, the Mjølnir crater in the Barents Sea (142 Æ 2.6 Myr ago; 40 km in diameter; Dypvik et al., 1996), and the smaller Gosses Bluff crater in Australia (142.5 Æ 0.8 Myr ago; 22 km in diameter) apparently also occurred near the Jurassic/Cretaceous boundary. According to the data compilations of Sepkoski (2002), the J/K transition was marked by the disappearance of w40% of marine species. Hallam (1986) emphasized that mollusk families show a drastic reduction in Late Jurassic times, although the mollusk extinction event(s) may have been concentrated regionally in Western Europe and Russia.
Ejecta found near the end-Jurassic extinction event in the Northern Hemisphere are most likely the result of the Mjølnir impact structure, and not the slightly older, larger and more distant Morokweng impact crater. Dypvik et al. (1996) traced the ejecta layer from Mjølnir in the Barents Sea, to an Upper Jurassic/Lower Cretaceous section in drill holes off northern Norway, more than 800 km from the impact. The layer contains shocked quartz grains and an Ir anomaly of up to w1 ppb with element ratios similar to meteorites. It is placed very close to the regional Boreal J/K boundary based on ammonites.
This agrees with the report of a large Ir anomaly (average 7.8 Æ 4.7 ppb) from a Jurassic/Cretaceous sequence in northern Siberia (Zakharov et al., 1993). The Ir anomaly, with chondritic siderophile element ratios and abundant pyritic microspherules, occurs at the same stratigraphic level as the ejecta layer from the Mjølnir impact, some 2300 km distant. Thus, although the worldwide formal correlation of the J/K boundary remains unsettled (stemming in part from the difﬁculty of correlating northern faunas with those of the equatorial Tethyan and Southern Hemisphere sites) (Housa et al., 2007) there is now evidence that the transition between those two periods is associated with the times of at least 3 impact craters and the widespread ejecta layer from a w40 kmdiameter impact structure (Smelror et al., 2001).
In England, the correlative horizon lies within the non-marine Purbeck beds of the uppermost Jurassic strata, at an exotic, oyster-rich marine-incursion deposit called the Cinder Bed (McDonald et al., 2006). A coarse-grained deposit of the same age is found in northern France (Deconinck et al., 2000), and these sediments have been attributed to tsunami. These horizons were examined for iridium (Irvine et al., 2003; McDonald et al., 2006), but with negative results thus far, and in a cursory manner for shocked quartz grains (e.g., in thin sections, where they would be so rare as to be undetectable).

At the Bosso Gorge section across the J/K boundary in Italy, Kudielka et al. (2000) found several iridium spikes (based on carbonate-free samples). These spikes are between 100 and 200 ppt, well below the ppb iridium values seen at the K/Pg boundary, but they are well above background Ir concentrations. Furthermore, in the Bosso section, one of the iridium-enriched layers is unusually coarse and contains rip-up clasts of the underlying bed. It appears to have been formed by rapid current movement (tsunami?), perhaps correlative with the deposits in northern Europe. That particular layer also has a large 4He spike, potentially indicating a source outside the basin. No one has looked for microtektites or shocked minerals in this section.
2.4. Puchezh-Katunki impact
The 80 km diameter Puchezh-Katunki crater in Russia has been dated at 167 Æ 3 Myr ago. It is thus correlative with the latest age of the Bajocian-Bathonian boundary (168 Myr) (Pallfy, 2004). This boundary is listed as a doubtful extinction event at the family level by Raup and Sepkoski (1986), but as a minor extinction peak in their genera-level data. Bambach (2006) did not include this event in his list of mass extinctions.
Rocchia et al. (1986) found an iridium anomaly of 3.2 ppb in a layer a few mm thick, in a Bajocian/Bathonian marine sequence in northern Italy. Jehanno and Boclet (1988) discovered pyritic microspherules in the same layer. These authors attributed the layer to the formation of a hardground. Shocked minerals were not speciﬁcally searched for. Two other, smaller impact craters (Zapadnaya, 4 km diameter at 165 Æ 5 Myr ago, and Obolon, 15 km diameter at 169 Æ 7 Myr ago) may also have contributed to the proposed distal ejecta layer. Recently, the Bajocian/Bathonian age of the PuchezhKatunki crater has been questioned. We note a recent abstract reporting a preliminary 40Ar/39Ar age of 192 Æ 0.8 Myr for the Puchezh-Katunki impact structure (Holm-Alwmark et al., 2016).
2.5. Manicouagan impact
The 100 km diameter Manicouagan crater in Quebec, Canada has been dated at 214 Æ 1 Myr ago, which would put it near the middle/ upper Norian stage boundary at 215 Myr ago (the Norian ranges from 228.4 to 209.5 Myr ago) of the Late Triassic period. Walkden et al. (2013) reported an Upper Triassic ejecta layer in the southwestern

UK containing iridium and shocked quartz linked to Manicouagan; Kirkham (2003) found spherules in the same layer (see also Thackrey et al., 2009). On the other side of the world, in Japan, Onoue et al. (2012) found an ejecta layer with platinum-group element anomalies, microspherules and Ni-rich spinel crystals in the mid-Norian, and correlated it with the Manicouagan impact-cratering event. The same layer has yielded a negative 188Os/187Os anomaly, in line with an extraterrestrial impact source (Sato et al., 2013).
The mid-Norian does not stand out as a peak of marine extinctions in the data compilations of Raup and Sepkoski (1984, 1986) or Bambach (2006), but terrestrial records of Upper Triassic vertebrate-bearing strata in the southwestern U.S. suggest that a signiﬁcant faunal (reptiles) and ﬂoral turnover, occurred in the middle Norian (the boundary between the Adamanian and Revueltian Late Triassic Vertebrate Faunachrons). This has been linked provisionally with the time of the Manicouagan impact (Parker and Martz, 2010).
In Japan, there was a great reduction of pelagic radiolarians at that time. We calculate that 19 out of 22 (90%) of extant Late Triassic radiolarian species went extinct at the ejecta horizon (using data from Onoue et al., 2012). Onoue et al. (2016) suggested a catastrophic collapse of the pelagic ecosystem at the Middle/Upper Norian boundary related to the Manicouagan impact. The impactevent layer also coincides with losses of conodonts and ammonoids (Onoue et al., 2016).
3. Correlation of the largest craters with stratigraphic evidence of impacts
There are in total 11 extinction events, including the provisional events at 168 and 215 Myr ago (after Raup and Sepkoski, 1986; Parker and Martz, 2010) (Table 1; see arrows in Fig. 1), and 6 large craters (diameters !70 km, taking the Morokweng/Mjølnir craters as one event) in the past 250 Myr (Rampino and Caldeira, 2015) (Table 1, see stars in Fig. 1). If we allow errors of Æ2 Myr for the times of extinction, and consider round-off errors, then the 11 extinction times occupy a total of 44 Myr. Thus, a single crater has a probability p of 44/250 ¼ 0.169 ¼ 16.9% chance of being within Æ2 million years of an extinction event.
The probability of n extinction events being contemporaneous (to within Æ2 Myr) with k cratering events is: P ¼ pn, where p in this case ¼ 0.169. Thus, the probability of the 6 largest impact craters

Arrows indicate times of 11 extinction events (dashed arrows indicate minor events) (Raup and Sepkoski, 1986; Parker and Martz, 2010). Stars are the ages of the 6 largest (!70 km in diameter) impact craters, which correlate with 4 (2 with the same event at 36 Myr), or possibly 6 extinction events (if one includes the minor extinction events at 168 and 215 Myr) and with 6 potential stratigraphic traces of impacts (including Morokweng/Mjølnir as one event) (see Table 1).

1244

being coeval with 6 proposed extinction events (Æ2 Myr) is only 0.0023% (note that 2 craters match the 36 Myr extinction). Furthermore, the probability of all 6 of the largest craters being coeval with 6 stratigraphic traces of impact (Æ2 Myr) (counting the Morokweng/Mjølnir impacts as one event), where p ¼ 0.169, is also only 0.0023%. These small values indicate that viewing these coincidences as chance occurrences can be rejected at greater than the 99.99% level of conﬁdence.
If we remove from consideration the provisional extinction events at 168 and 215 Myr ago, that leaves 9 extinction events during the last 250 Myr. If we include errors of Æ2 Myr, then the 9 remaining extinctions occupy 36 Myr. Thus, we have p ¼ 0.144, as the probability of a single crater being within Æ2 Myr from an extinction event, and if n ¼ 4 craters (Chesapeake, Popigai, Chicxulub, and Morokweng/Mjolnir), then pn ¼ 0.00043 or 0.043% (chance occurrences can be rejected at the 99.96% conﬁdence level).
4. Conclusions
The 6 largest craters (!70 km in diameter) (Chesapeake, Popigai, Chicxulub, Morokweng/Mjølnir, Puchezh-Katunki and Manicouagan) of the last 250 Myr coincide with recognized extinction events at 36 (2 craters), 66, 145 Myr, and with provisional extinction events at 168 and 215 Myr. The craters also coincide with independent stratigraphic signatures of impact e coincidences that are very unlikely to have occurred by chance. These results provide a potential link between several large impacts and extinction events.
