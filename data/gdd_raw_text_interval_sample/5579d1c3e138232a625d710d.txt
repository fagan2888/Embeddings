EXPLANATION OF FORMAT
In this pamphlet, descriptions of rock units are arranged in the traditional manner (youngest to oldest) except for rocks of Tertiary age. Because of the large number of Tertiary units, the descriptions and correlation table (see map sheet) have been divided into seven sections on the basis of similarities in volcanotectonic history (see "Areal index to subdivisions of Tertiary rocks," on map sheet). Rock units that are present in more than one area are fully described for the area in which they are best known. Cross references between areas are provided. Within each area, the rocks are subdivided into intrusive and extrusive groups and described from youngest to oldest. An index to map units follows the list of references (p. 32).
Modal analyses are reported in abbreviated form: phenocryst abundance is reported as volume percent of rock sample ("phenocrysts (30)" means that 30 percent of the rock consists of phenocrysts); phenocryst mineral abundance is reported as percent of total phenocrysts. Names of minerals are abbreviated: q, quartz; af, alkali feldspar; pf, plagioclase feldspar; b, biotite; hb, hornblende; px, pyroxene; cpx, clinopyroxene; opx, orthopyroxene; ol, olivine; op, opaque oxides.
Wherever it was necessary to use place names in the description of map units, we have provided geographic coordinates to the nearest minute, shown with latitude first and longitude following. These should enable the reader to locate the feature, map unit, or structure in question. In many cases the named location does not appear on the base map due to lack of space. Such locations are, generally, named on topographic quadrangles of larger scale.
A number of dating methods have been used in the Challis quadrangle. Potassium-argon and 40Ar-39Ar ages are listed in tables 1, 2, and 3 and cited where appropriate in the description of map units. The correlation of Tertiary units shows our best estimates of the ages of Tertiary rocks; these estimates are based on stratigraphic relations, selected radiometric ages, and limited magnetic polarity data. Where the radiometric age falls outside the time span shown on the correlation, it is our opinion that other data are more compelling than the radiometric age.

DESCRIPTION OF MAP UNITS

QUATERNARY SURFICIAL DEPOSITS
Qd Quaternary deposits, undivided (Holocene and Pleistocene)-Includes modem stream alluvium, terrace gravel, talus and related slope material, landslide debris, and unconsolidated glacial moraines and outwash gravel
Qa Alluvium, undivided (Holocene)-Floodplain, terrace, and alluvial-fan deposits that include stream-deposited gravel, sand, and silt. Gravel and peat are in filled ponds and lakes
Qf Alluvial-fan deposits (Holocene)-Shown separately only in area near Challis and Antelope Flat (44°18' N., 114°04' W.), 30 km north of southeast comer of quadrangle
Ql Landslide and related deposits (Holocene) Qm Glacial deposits, undivided (Pleistocene)-Un-
sorted boulders, cobbles, pebbles, sand, silt, and clay in moraines and in glaciofluvial outwash. Belt of coalescent moraines along eastern front of Sawtooth Range has been attributed to two major late Pleistocene glaciations, the Bull Lake and the Pinedale (Williams, 1961) Qtr Travertine (Pleistocene)-Yellowish-white to cream-colored, irregularly thin- to mediumbedded, locally finely banded deposits of travertine showing varying degrees of irreg-

Tcb

ular cellular and concentric texture with local cavities and encrustations. Layering in most of the deposit is nearly horizontal. Many exposures at eastern margin have steeply inclined layering; some of these clearly are of slumped blocks; others could be of undisturbed travertine deposited on steep slopes. Thought to once have covered about 2.5 km2 on southwest side of Bradbury Flat (44°26' N., 114°10' W.). Probably related to presently extinct hot springs that issued from faults in underlying Paleozoic carbonate strata. Estimated thickness 100 m
MIOCENE VOLCANIC AND SEDIMENTARY ROCKS
Columbia River Basalt Group (Miocene)Dark-gray to black, fine-grained ophitic basalt; consists chiefly of plagioclase laths embedded in augite, and scattered crystals of magnetite. Exposures include small cap on ridge immediately west of Grimes Pass (44°01' N., 115°49.8' W.) and small outcrops west of Paddy Flat (44°45' N., 115°59' W.), near northwest comer of quadrangle

1

Tpa Payette Formation (Miocene)-Stratified, tan Tgp to gray, loosely consolidated arkosic sandstone and siltstone and interstratified conglomerate and thin-bedded, dark-gray to black shale in which are abundant impressions of upper middle to lower upper Miocene leaves (W. C. Rember, written commun., 1983). Formation also contains seams of low-rank coal as much as 30 em thick, bedded intervals several meters thick of light-gray to white diatomaceous earth, and beds of gray volcanic ash as much as 30 em thick. Formation crops out along west side of Middle Fork of Payette River northwest of Crouch (44°07' N., 115°58' W.). It was deposited in an intermontane basin and is now part of a west-tilted, down-faulted block. Minimum thickness 1,680 m; base not exposed

EOCENE CHALLIS VOLCANIC GROUP; SEDIMENTARY AND IGNEOUS ROCKS
The Challis Volcanic Group is here raised in stratigraphic rank to replace the formation name "Challis Volcanics" (Ross, 1937) in this map area. The Challis Volcanic Group contains a large number of informal map units, many of which may be defined as formations in the future. The latite-andesite member and the Germer Tuffaceous Member of Ross (1937) are herein abandoned because these terms have fallen into disuse and they do not adequately describe the stratigraphic relations as currently understood. The term "Yankee Fork Rhyolite Member" was abandoned by Foster in 1982.

Gray porphyry-Gray dacite porphyry and minor diorite porphyry. Consists of both extrusive and intrusive rock. These rocks mostly have a dense or cryptocrystalline groundmass but, locally, have a holocrystalline, fme-grained groundmass (diorite porphyry). Phenocrysts of plagioclase generally are conspicuous and, in Indian Creek area (44°48' N., 115°13' W.), commonly are 23 mm long. Quartz is sparse. Mafic minerals consist of varying proportions of biotite, hornblende, and pyroxene. Phenocryst content varies from about 20 to 50 percent. In places, dacitic rocks clearly intrude lapilli tuff (Tdq) and possibly younger tuff units as well. In other places, rocks appear to be stratiform, having flow layering that defines gentle dips and containing interlayered zones of flow breccia characteristic of contact zones between lava flows. As mapped, therefore, this unit in some places includes dacite lava that is correlative with the lower latite lava (Tll) and in other places includes dikes and irregularly shaped intrusives that probably are younger than lapilli tuff (Tdq). Also correlates in part with dacite and diorite porphyry (Tdc) mapped in western part of quadrangle (see p. 20). For additional description, see p. 5 and 10
Extrusive and sedimentary rocks
Latite of Lookout Mountain-Black, nearly aphyric, vesicular lava interbedded with cinders and bombs. Rock locally contains sparse small (0.5 mm long) phenocrysts of plagioclase and small prisms (as long as 1.0 mm) of hypersthene set in groundmass of randomly oriented plagioclase microlites and glass. Leonard and Marvin (1982) report whole-rock potassium-argon ages of 41.0±1.4 m.y. and 43.4±1.4 m.y. for two samples collected just north of Challis quadrangle. Thickness 0-50 m
Beds of Dewey mine-Cauldron-filling sedimentary rocks and bedded, reworked ash-fall tuff. Includes siltstone in varved lake beds and coarse volcaniclastic conglomerate containing intercalated landslide debris and talus; carbonaceous in part. Thickness 0-50 m
Sunnyside tuff of Shannon and Reynolds (1975)-An informal term used by Shannon and Reynolds (1975) in the Thunder Mountain mining district and now used throughout the Thunder Mountain cauldron complex.

Unit overlies tuff of Ellis Creek (Te), underlies the tuffs of Camas Creek-Black Mountain (Tc), and locally shares some characteristics of each unit. Included in tuff of Pennal Gulch (Tp) south of Table Mountain. Where densely welded and rich in phenocrysts, it is not easily distinguished from tuff of Ellis Creek; it differs only in contammg significant amounts of alkali feldspar and fewer mafic minerals.

Unit contains abundant apatite, modest amounts of zircon, and sparse allanite as accessories. Most quartz phenocrysts are slightly embayed. Large grains that are extensively embayed are common. Biotite from exposures of this unit near West Fork of Morgan Creek (44°43' N., 114°15' W.) has potassium-argon age of 48.4±1.7 m.y. (see table 1), which agrees with stratigraphic position of this tuff, below 47.8-m.y.-old tuff of Table Mountain (Ttm). Thickness 0 to more than 300m. For additional description, see p. 9, 13, and 15

Rocks exposed within cauldron complex commonly are partly altered to chlorite, epidote, and associated minerals. Locally, as along West Fork of Camas Creek (44°49' N., 114°18' W.), abundant very fine grained magnetite darkens rock. Sample from northeast of Duck Peak (44°55' N., 114°29' W.), in Panther Creek graben, has potassiumargon age on biotite of 48.4±1.6 m.y. (see

Trf Rhyolite dikes, plugs, and flows-Light-gray, tan, and pinki~h-red, generally crystal-poor or only moderately crystal-rich, porphyritic intrusive rocks and minor flows. Rock typically contains phenocrysts of quartz and sanidine in variable amounts; plagioclase locally present in minor amounts. Locally contains minor biotite and, rarely, trace amounts of pyroxene. These rocks display fabrics ranging from massive to flowlaminated to autobrecciated. In thin section, textures vary from glassy to devitrified to fine grained, allotriomorphic, and granular. In ridges between East Fork of Mayfield Creek and Yankee Fork (44°30' N., 114°40' W.) at least two generations of rhyolite are present. Older rhyolite is glassy to devitrified and is intruded by dikes and pluglike masses Tdc of more massive rhyolite. Narrow rhyolite Tgp dikes and irregularly shaped intrusive masses pervade west and north margins of Twin Peaks caldera and crosscut lower part of tuff of Challis Creek (Tcrl, see p. 12) and the caldera-wall slump debris (Tsd, see p. 11 ). Potassium-argon age of sanidine is 46.5±1.7 (see table 1)

Locally, near contacts, rock is black and vitrophyric or perlitic, devitrified, and gray-green weathering. Rock has steep to vertical flow foliation and locally has isoclinal flow folds with steep to vertical axial planes of variable strike. Locally, this rock contains cavities lined with chalcedonic quartz. In hand specimen, rock resembles rhyolite of Red Butte (Trb, see p. 13), except that, unlike rhyolite of Red Butte, it generally contains scattered sanidine phenocrysts. Unit is in intrusive contact with tuff of Challis Creek (Tcr) in upper Pats Creek area (44°36' N., 114°21' W.) and in upper Eddy Creek above Eddy Basin (44°40' N., 114°27.5' W.). A pluglike mass (not shown on map) containing plagioclase, biotite, sanidine, and hornblende phenocrysts is on Spider Creek (44°40.5' N., 114°26.5' W.). This rock is light greenish gray, medium brown weathering, and steeply flow foliated; it contains abundant gas cavities lined with rosettes of gypsum and minor calcite Diorite complex-For description, see p. 20 Gray porphyry-Biotite from sample collected near Casto (44°34' N., 114°50' W.) gave potassium-argon age of 48.6±1.4 m.y.

Tuff of Challis Creek-Principal ash-flow tuff sequence erupted with collapse of Twin Peaks caldera (see table 4) (Hardyman, 1981). Caldera-wall slump debris (Tsd) and three ash-flow-tuff units (Tcru, Term, Tcrl) are mapped within caldera. A single ashflow tuff (Tcr) is mapped outside caldera
Tsd Caldera-wall slump debris (megabreccia-Heterogeneous deposit of coarse talus and megabreccia (following usage of Lipman, 1976) interfingering and admixed with ash-flow tuff. Deposits of this material are localized along ring-fracture system on southeast margin of Twin Peaks caldera (44°34' N., 114°23' W.) and in northern part of caldera, where they extend into caldera from its north and west margins. In lower

part of unit are bedded, indurated, coarse conglomeratic sandstone and angular talus deposits, resembling concrete on fresh fracture; these deposits also form thin, lenslike layers and pods throughout the map unit. Megabreccia consists of tuffaceous matrixsupported to block-supported deposits of angular, unsorted pebble- to boulder-size clasts and house-size blocks of ash-flow tuff, intermediate and siliceous lava, epiclastic rock, and abundant fragments of tuff of Challis Creek. Ash-flow tuff matrix of megabreccia is nonwelded and crystal poor; it resembles tuff of Challis Creek except for higher plagioclase content.

Accessory minerals are zircon, allanite, and trace amounts of apatite. Sanidine phenocrysts, as long as 5 mm, are chatoyant. Quartz phenocrysts commonly are slightly resorbed, bipyramidal, and smoky. Phenocrysts are somewhat smaller and less abundant in basal part of unit than in densely welded tuff. This unit, like middle and lower cooling units (Term and Tcrl), has little or no plagioclase or ferromagnesian minerals. Plagioclase does not generally exceed 0.5 percent of total phenocrysts, biotite is uncommon, and minor pyroxene grains are preserved only in most densely welded tuff. Except locally near base, this unit is medium-gray to brownish-gray, brownweathering, densely welded, devitrified ashflow tuff containing pumice lapilli as much as 12 em long and 3 em thick (uncommonly as much as 26 em long and 2 em thick) and scattered pebble- to cobble-size fragments of gray to lavender, aphyric intermediate to rhyolitic lava. Pumice lapilli are in places medium to rusty brown and darker than matrix or light gray and lighter than matrix. Sanidine has been dated by 40Ar-39Ar methods at 45.5±0.3 m.y. (see table 3).

At all these localities, these rocks crop out beneath volcaniclastic rocks mapped as Tvs. Near Sheep Mountain, tuff of Sage Creek is mixed with breccia and intermediate lava (Tdf); contact between the two units is arbitrary. In some samples of breccia containing blocks with phenocrysts of plagioclase, quartz, biotite, and amphibole, dominance of matrix by crystals of plagioclase and sanidine demonstrates intermingling of material from two sources.

Matrix Tri of conglomerate contains volcanic component throughout. Locally includes pyroclastic flow that contains lava blocks containing plagioclase, biotite, amphibole, and quartz phenocrysts. Present only near southeast corner of quadrangle. Also included in this unit is prevolcanic fanglomerate exposed southeast of Lone Pine Peak (44°21' N., 114°10' W.). Clasts in fanglomerate were derived Td from nearby exposures of Paleozoic rocks, which formed topographically high ridges prior to volcanism
Western and south-central parts of quadrangle
Intrusive rocks
Tdl Diabase and lamprophyre dikes-Diabase dikes are the more common. Rock is dark and fine to medium grained; consists chiefly of lathlike crystals of plagioclase enclosed in matrix of pyroxene crystals. Diabase dikes are youngest dikes and crosscut all others. They are the most continuous and commonly trend northwest. Lamprophyric dikes are Tdu dark gray to black, fine grained, and somewhat porphyritic; commonly range from a Tg few centimeters to a meter or so in width and are only a few meters in strike length. Augite, brown hornblende, biotite, and plagioclase are principal minerals of this rock, which is a young rock but its relation to the diabase is unknown
Trd Rhyolite dikes-Rocks are light colored and generally porphyritic, containing rounded

and embayed quartz phenocrysts. Potassium feldspar phenocrysts are more plentiful than plagioclase. Matrices are pinkish gray and aphanitic. Modal compositions include rhyolite, quartz-latite, and rhyodacite. The rocks are altered: sericite is developed from feldspars and iron oxides from pyrite. Dikes range from a few meters to more than 30 m wide and are as much as several hundred meters long. Rhyolite dikes are more numerous near bodies of granite (Tg), to which they probably are related, and, like that rock, are more radioactive than other plutonic rocks or dikes. Granophyric matrices common in dikes cutting Idaho batholith rocks north of Stanley. Some dikes in that area also are composite, having marginal zones more mafic than rhyolite Rhyolite stock-Red-weathering, yellowishgray, aphanitic rhyolite that contains sparse phenocrysts of quartz as long as 1 mm and pyrite or pyrite casts. Forms massive outcrops. Rhyolite is well exposed on ridge southeast of Cape Horn Creek (44°21.5' N., 115°11.5' W.), where stock contains roof pendants of granodiorite (Kgd, seep. 21) and metasedimentary rocks (rp, see p. 26) Dikes-Rocks are dark green to gray and commonly porphyritic, containing phenocrysts of zoned plagioclase as long as 2 em; compositions are primarily andesite, dacite, and latite. Phenocrysts of hornblende, somewhat altered to chlorite, and euhedral biotite also commonly present. Quartz phenocrysts are sparse. Phenocrysts are set in groundmass of andesine-oligoclase, minor potassium feldspar, hornblende, and magnetite. Sphene and allanite are common accessories. Dikes range from a few meters to more than 30 m wide and are as much as several hundred meters long.

much as 5 percent of rock. Except for visible muscovite, rock is similar to biotite granodiorite (Kgd), with which it is transitional through zone about 2 km or more wide. It is" exposed in western part of quadrangle and comprises what is considered to be core of Atlanta lobe of Idaho batholith. Includes quartz monzonite of Warm Lake of Schmidt (1964). Potassium-argon ages of nine samples range from 65.3 to 73.9±2.7 m.y. for biotite and from 68.8±0.2 to 74.7±2.7 for muscovite (see table 2) Biotite granodiorite-Gray to light-gray, medium- to coarse-grained, and equigranular to porphyritic rock. Plagioclase (An22_30) is chief component of rock, which has lesser quantities of quartz and potassium feldspar. Biotite is principal mafic mineral, constituting as much as 5 percent of rock in most places; however, east of Stanley Basin it makes up 25 percent of rock. Hornblende is rare. Biotite granodiorite is most common granitic rock of Idaho batholith and is exposed over vast areas. In western part of quadrangle rock was identified by Schmidt (1964) as granodiorite of Gold Fork. Biotite granodiorite is intruded into older tonalite (Kt, see below) and in the 60- to 90-m-wide contact zone it exhibits intensive primary foliation as well as xenoliths of tonalite. Includes foliated diorite in Loon Creek (44°35' N., 114°51' W.) and at mouth of Camas Creek (44°53' N., 114°44' W.). Potassium-argon ages of biotite range from 61.5 to 98.1±3.3 m.y. (see table 2) Sphene-enriched biotite granodioriteMapped by Schmidt (1964) as leucocratic quartz diorite of Little Valley Porphyritic biotite granodiorite and graniteCoarsely porphyritic granitoid rock containing metacrysts of pink potassium feldspar (microcline) from 3 to 10 em long in medium- to coarse-grained matrix that contains roughly equal amounts of microcline, plagioclase, and quartz; generally 5-15 percent biotite and variable amounts of hornblende. Foliation commonly present and locally strongly developed in area west and north of Stanley Basin. Also included in this unit are rocks that form cores of stock at White Cloud Peaks and large pluton east of Stanley Basin. In those areas rocks are unfoliated porphyritic biotite granite and biotite granodiorite that contain metacrysts of mi-

crocline 1-3 em long in medium-grained granitoid matrix containing predominantly 5-10 percent, and rarely as much as 20-25 percent, biotite and approximately equal amounts of quartz, potassium feldspar, and plagioclase. Equigranular margins of two bodies are separated from porphyritic granite cores by potassic metasomatized transition zone as much as 1.5 km wide that contains abundant veins and pods of potassium feldspar and locally abundant secondary muscovite that coats joints. Potassium-argon ages of biotite from four samples range from 62.6 to 84±2 m.y. (see table 2) Hornblende-biotite granodiorite-Gray, medium- to coarse-grained, equigranular to porphyritic, commonly foliated granodiorite; biotite and hornblende are aligned in plane of foliation. Rock commonly is associated with xenoliths and pendants on high ridges in western part of quadrangle. It is intermixed with tonalite (Kt); the two rock types form border zone of Atlanta lobe of Idaho batholith Tonalite and granodiorite-Gray to dark-gray, medium- to coarse-grained, equigranular to porphyritic rock. Plagioclase (andesine) is dominant mineral of rock, some of which contains biotite or hornblende and which ranges from massive to highly foliated. It is exposed in western part of quadrangle, where it includes quartz dioritic gneiss of Donnelly (Schmidt, 1964), and in westcentral part of quadrangle in Loon Creek drainage basin (44°32' N., 114°51' W.). East of Stanley and southwest of mouth of Warm Spring Creek (44°08' N., 115°58' W.) this unit is equigranular, medium-grained, granitoid rock containing 30-35 percent amphibole laths, 40-50 percent plagioclase, and about 20 percent quartz. Amphibole is partly altered to brown, highly pleochroic biotite and to epidote. Sphene is principal accessory mineral. Potassium-argon ages of biotite from three samples range from 71.9±2.5 to 81.6±2.9 m.y. (see table 2) Mixed rock units-Mainly alaskite that encloses Precambrian metamorphic xenoliths

Occurs as numerous small, irregular dikes, small plugs, and sill-like tabular masses scattered over area east and northeast of Clayton. Most commonly found intruded along or near thrust fault at base of Clayton Mine Quartzite (0£q). Fissiontrack age of 140.1±17.4 m.y. was obtained from zircon in quartzite immediately adjacent to contact with gabbro at mouth of Bayhorse Creek (44°22.5' N., 114°15' W.) (R. A. Zimmermann, written commun., 1983). This age for the zircon indicates time of track annealing caused by heat from gabbro intrusion. It also serves as limiting age for thrust fault beneath Clayton Mine Quartzite, already in existence prior to intrusion of gabbro

PALEOZOIC SEDIMENTARY ROCKS
Grand Prize Formation (Lower Permian)Well-exposed sequence of fine-grained, dark-gray, carbonaceous argillite, siltite, limy siltite, and silty limestone. Weathers dark brown, reddish brown, or dark gray. Much of sequence is graded and has abundant crossbedding, convolute structures, and prominent banded appearance. Measured section on north side of Pole Creek at confluence with Grand Prize Creek (43°56' N., 114°41' W.) at type locality in Hailey 1°X2° quadrangle is about 2,000 m thick, but neither top nor bottom is exposed. Conodonts collected by C. M. Tschanz from low in section at Pole Creek are reported to be Leonardian-Roadian (upper Lower Permian) by Bruce Wardlaw (written commun., 1979). On Pungo Mountain a sequence about 100 m thick of thin-bedded limestone and calcareous argillite that have been extensively metamorphosed to tremolite-actinolite is questionably assigned to this unit.

Interbedded in calcareous sandstone are fine-grained sandy limestone, fine- to medium-grained bioclastic limestone, and brown, thick-bedded, fine-grained quartzite. Crossbedding and convolute structures are common. Unit is dated on basis of abundant fusulinids. Minimum thickness 3,400 m at type locality (Hall and others, 1974) Lower part (Upper to Middle Pennsylvanian)-Includes units 1, 2, 3, and 4 of Hall and others (1974). Lower part of Wood River Formation is present only from Railroad Ridge (44°08.5' N., 114°35.5' W.) at Little Livingston and Hermit mines south to Livingston mine. Unit 1 is chert and quartzite conglomerate present as thin fault slivers at Little Livingston and Hermit mines. It is overlain by succession about 150 m thick of fine-grained limy sandstone, silty limestone, and limy siltstone that includes units 2, 3, and4 Salmon River assemblage (Paleozoic)Medium- to dark-gray, thin- to thick-bedded, well-laminated argillite, siltstone, calcareous siltstone, and fine-grained calcareous sandstone; some local grit and nearly pure, medium-gray limestone. Weathers tan, medium brown to dark brown, and, locally, light gray, blue gray, and pink. Sandstone is predominantly very fine to fine grained; some medium sand and grit layers; localized thin beds of chertlike, very siliceous argillite. Rock composed of variable proportions of quartz (predominant), clay minerals, carbonaceous material, sericite, mica, feldspar (usually only few percent), lithic fragments (argillite, shale, chert, fine-grained quartzite), various accessory minerals, and carbonate. Faint to prominent lamination in most places; cross lamination, current bedding, and sole structures in many fine-grained, thin sandstone beds and laminae. Dark colors related to amount of carbonaceous material, which ranges from nil to nearly 100 percent in few impure, coaly seams. Age of this assemblage is poorly known. Megafossils recovered from blocks of float found near mouth of Mill Creek (44°15' N., 114°33' W.) were assigned a Mississippian age (Hobbs and others, 1975).

Base of sequence as exposed in quadrangle is thrust fault; overthrust by Grand Prize Formation (Pg) between Warm Springs and Slate Creeks (44°13' N., 114°38' W.) and by Wood River Formation (PIPw and Pwl) near Washington Peak (44°01' N., 114°00' W.). Thickness and sequence of units indeterminate in most places because of isoclinal folding and thrust faulting.

Medium to thick bedded. Forms ledges. Contains much crinoidal debris, many corals, and brachiopods. Locally contains jasperoid (black silica as replacement of carbonate rocks). Evidence obtained elsewhere in region indicates that this material was formed during or after Eocene volcanism (B. A. Skipp, oral commun., 1983). Fragments of what appears to be this material within conglomerate at base of volcanic sequence (Tcg) suggest that jasperoid in this area may be both older than and penecontemporaneous with the volcanic rocks.

Lower 10 m includes foliated dolomitic quartzite, which grades downward to massive, cliff-forming, white to light-gray quartzite about 200 m thick consisting of virtually pure quartz in two size fractions, a framework fraction 0.4-0.6 mm in diameter and a matrix fraction 0.1-0.2 mm in diameter. Landreth (1964) noted a few pale-red-purple beds near lower part of unit and considered entire sequence to be Kinnikinic Quartzite. Dolomite sampled by P. J. Modreski from upper 30m contains conodonts of Middle or Late Ordovician age (J. Repetski, written commun., 1983) and an orthoid brachiopod identified by J. T. Dutro, Jr., (written commun., 1983) as probably genus Valcourea. Dutro further suggests that the collection might well represent Ella Dolomite. This allows possibility that quartzite is older than Kinnikinic and equivalent to Lower Ordovician Summerhouse Formation (Ruppel and others, 1975; McCandless, 1982). Total thickness about 1,450 m Upper carbonate unit (Ordovician)-Heterogeneous sequence of dolomite, silty dolomite, and dolomitic sandstone that crops out in Squaw Creek drainage basin, northwest of Clayton. Estimated thickness about 150m Siltstone, sandy siltstone, and quartzite of Rob Roy mine area (Ordovician? or Cambrian?)-Thickness of at least 600 m exposed only near Kinnikinic Creek north of Clayton. Top eroded; thrust fault at base Quartzite (Lower Ordovician or older)Divided into five map units by Hobbs and others (1975). Over most of its outcrop area, consists mostly of Clayton Mine Quartzite (Middle Ordovician or older), which is poorly sorted, coarse- to medium-grained, feldspathic quartzite that, in upper two-thirds of section, includes conglomerate layers, pebbly quartzite, and scattered pebbles. Very thin shale partings throughout. More than 1,000 m thick Ramshorn Slate (Ordovician?)-Gray, greenish-gray, purple, thin-bedded, welllaminated slate, locally phyllitic. Commonly shows well-developed cleavage at angle to bedding. Includes thin beds of sandstone toward top. Thick lens of conglomerate at

base in outcrops west of Challis. Thickness about 800 m
Bayhorse Dolomite (Lower Ordovician and Upper Cambrian)-Light-gray to yellowish-gray, medium-bedded to very thick bedded dolomite in upper part and medium- to dark-gray, thin-bedded, fine-grained limestone in lower part. Dolomite contains darkgray, silicified oval structures resembling pisolites in several layers as much as 9 m thick. Both upper and lower parts locally contain thin interbeds of siltstone, argillite, or fine-grained sandstone. Top of unit is erosional disconformity characterized by zone of probable paleokarst topography. Minimum thickness about 400 m
Garden Creek Phyllite (Cambrian(?))-Darkgray to black, slightly calcareous phyllite. As shown, includes small area of dolomite beneath phyllite, which is exposed in bed of Bayhorse Creek west of Bayhorse. Estimated thickness is 150--300 m
Quartzite, shale, and carbonate rocks of Squaw Creek area (Cambrian)-Includes fossiliferous upper Middle Cambrian shale and underlying sequence of quartzite and carbonate rocks of Cambrian or older age (Hobbs and others, 1968). Mapped as four separate units by Hobbs and others (1975)

Interbedded quartzite, dolomite, and argillite of Leaton Gulch and Pennal Gulch areas (Ordovician?, Cambrian?, Late Proterozoic?)-Sequence of predominantly quartzitic strata containing subordinate dolomite interbeds and some thin argillitic interbeds and locally thicker argillite intervals. Quartzite generally deep red to dark purplish gray to medium gray; some thick zones of light pinkish or tannish gray and very light gray to white; medium grays and purplish grays predominate. Thin to medium bedded, platy, laminated; some massive units are thick bedded and structureless; mostly medium to fine grained, locally coarse grained and pebbly; lamination prominent in some thick layers; includes several zones of very coarse conglomerate or intraformational breccia. Much of thin-bedded platy quartzite shows ripple marks, flute casts, worm trails; abundant magnetite in parts of section. Do-

lomite very fine grained to dense, light to medium tan on fresh surface, weathers rich reddish tan to brown; beds dispersed in quartzite and range from 0.2 m to several meters in thickness; restricted to area within y s 1 km east from Beardsley Hot Springs (44°31' N., 114°10' W.). Argillite occurs as laminae or thin interbeds in much of quartzite sequence and locally forms continuous sequence as much as 100m thick; generally thin bedded, fissile; dark gray or purplish gray, in places altered to deep gray green. Many argillaceous layers metamorphosed to phyllite close to thrust faults. Sequence of rock types is indeterminate because of com- y g plex structure and discontinuity of exposures. General characteristics of strata and structural relations to Swauger Formation suggest possible correlation with Late Proterozoic Wilbert and (or) Lower Ordovician Summerhouse Formations (Ruppel, 1975) or with formation of Tyler Peak of Early Cambrian age (McCandless, 1982) rp Roof pendants and xenoliths of metamorphic rock in Idaho batholith, undivided (Paleozoic? or Proterozoic?)-Includes schist, quartzite, and calc-silicate rocks. At some places graphite is common constituent of rocks. Includes Thompson Peak Formation of Reid (1963) rps Schist roof pendant-Exposures of these y a rocks east of Big Baldy Lookout (44°47' N., 114°13' W.) are principally staurolitemuscovite-biotite-quartz schist and locally, according to B.

MIDDLE PROTEROZOIC SEDIMENTARY AND METAMORPHIC
ROCKS
Yl Lawson Creek Formation-Thin- to mediumbedded and interbedded fine-grained, platy, pink to greenish-gray quartzite and darkpurplish-gray quartzitic phyllite containing some zones of laminated purple, sandy argillite. Quartzite is feldspathic, locally containing much coarse mica on bedding planes, and has conspicuous ripple marks and other sedimentary structures. Some thicker quartzite beds similar to Swauger Formation in general characteristics. Base of sequence is

gradational through distance of a few meters with the Swauger Formation on which it lies; top not known; minimum thickness about 1,300 m (Hobbs, 1980)
Swauger Formation-Light-pink, pinkish-tan, purplish-gray to locally red, medium- to coarse-grained, fairly pure, well-sorted quartzite; commonly contains several percent feldspar; medium to thick bedded, locally prominent cross-lamination; few very thin shaly partings. Base not exposed; top seems to grade over several meters into Lawson Creek Formation (Yl). Minimum thickness about 3,000 m
Gunsight Formation-Light-brownish-gray, fine- to medium-grained (0.3-0.6 mm diameter), thin- to thick-bedded, sericitic quartzite; typically contains about 60-65 percent quartz, 30 percent sericite, 2-4 percent orthoclase and perthite, 3-6 percent microcline, 0.4-0.6 percent plagioclase. Rock is not well sorted; mostly well rounded quartz "berries" as large as 0.7 mm commonly occur in matrix of grains averaging about 0.3 mm diameter. Some exposures contain only trace amounts of alkali feldspar and plagioclase and considerably less than 15 percent sericite, and appear to be gradational with overlying Swauger Formation. Thickness 400 m (incomplete)
Apple Creek Formation-Mainly siltstone and fine-grained sandstone; medium-greenishgray to grayish-red-purple to dark-gray, thinbedded, laminated siltstone containing irregular streaks and lenses of light-gray, pinkishto pale-brown sandstone cemented by ferrodolomite. Sandstone lenticles are typically a few millimeters to several centimeters thick and 1 m, more or less, long, although much longer lenses are known. Medium-gray to brownish-gray to light-gray or pale-red, feldspathic, fine-grained quartzite beds several centimeters in thickness occur in what appear to be stratigraphically higher parts of unit. Ripple marks and other sedimentary structures are abundant, and many bedding surfaces are coated with detrital mica; lamination and cross-lamination in fine-grained sandstone common. Disconnected exposures and complex structure prevent accurate correlation of beds and determination of thickness. No base or top exposed in quadrangle. It is possible that upper part of section mapped as Yellowjacket Formation (Yy)

Cater and others (1973) considered these rocks to be Precambrian in age, and Peale (1982, p. 58) considered them to be Cambrian(?) to Ordovician(?). Diorite and quartz diorite are part of composite mass that includes syenite (sr, see below). Gabbro and diabase may be as old as Precambrian, but ages of other rocks of this unit clearly are uncertain. Karl Evans (written commun., 1984) obtained an Ordovician age on zircons from syenite in this map unit from a locality a few kilometers east of Middle Fork Peak (44°58' N., 114°39' W.) sr Quartz syenite, syenite, and granite-A composite mass, considered by Ross (1934) to be Tertiary in age. According to Peale (1982, p. 61-62), rocks all contain quartz except for syenite, which is rare. Mode: q, 5-32; af (mostly microcline-microperthite), 37-85; pf, 1-28; b, 0-5; ferrohastingsite, 0-15. Much of rock in this unit is remarkably fresh and postorogenic; it intrudes highly deformed Precambrian rocks. Rock resembles syenite of known Tertiary age elsewhere in quadrangle; in particular, it resembles syenite that is part of intrusive mass at Jackson Peak (Tdc), which intrudes Idaho batholith and has an Eocene potassium-argon age (see page 20). It also closely resembles ''hornblende granite" of Ross (1934); which intrudes Challis Volcanics. These rocks presumably are same age as syenite mapped within unit dr (see p. 27)

Table 2. Potassium-argon ages of Cretaceous granitic rocks of the Idaho batholith

[All ages calculated using constants of Steiger and Jaeger (1977). Many of these potassium-argon ages do not represent ages of pluton emplacement. Many are younger because of prolonged residence of the rocks at temperatures above the argon blocking temperature and because of reheating associated with Eocene plutonism (see Criss and others, 1982); do, ditto]
