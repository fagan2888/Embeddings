GEOLOGY AND COAL RESOURCES OF THE CUMBERLAND, HOBART, AND MAPLE VALLEY QUADRANGLES, KING COUNTY, WASHINGTON

By JAMES D. VINE

ABSTRACT
'l'he Cumberland, Hobart, and Maple Valley quadrangles, King County, Wash., are 11 to 32 miles southeast of Seattle along the east side of the Puget Sound lowland and the west side of the Cascade Range. The area is underla~n by Tertiary nnd Quaternary sedimentary, Yolcanic, and intrusive rocks covered in places by surficial deposits. Geologically and geographically the map11ed area may be divided into two main m·ens-the Green RiYer area to the south, and the Tiger Mount·nin-'l'nylor Mountain upland area to the north.
~L'he Puget Grou11 includes the oldest rocks known to crop out in this aren. In the Green Rin•r area the Puget Group was not subdb·ided in map11ing; it includes about 6,200 feet of nonmarine sedimentary rocks that range in age from early !Docene to early Oligocene. In the Tiger Mountain-Taylor Mountnin uvland areas, rocl\:S of the same age crop out but are about 14,000 feet thick and are subdivided into four formations. Three of the formations are in the Puget Group--the Tiger Mountain, Tnlnvila, and Renton Formations. The underlying Raging River ]!"ormation is excluded from the Puget Group partly because it contains marine fossils. Marked changes in thickness and lithology of the strata suggest that deposition was in a trough which subsided nearly twice as fast in the northern part of the area as in the southern part. Very little mixing of sediment occurred between the two areas.
In the southern part of the area, the undifferentiated Puget Group is almost continuously exposed in the canyon of the Green River. More than half the sequence is sandstone; siltstone, carbonaceous claystone, and coal make up the rest. Coal beds are numerous, and some beds have been traced in underground mines for several miles. Most of the commercially important coal beds are in two zones, the Kummer and Franklin coal zones. The Kummer coal· zone comprises about 1,200 feet · of strata in the upper part of the sequence; the Franklin coal zone includes about 3,000 feet in the middle of the sequence. Correia tion of strata from the canyon to outlying areas is based on a sequence of floral stages established by Wolfe in 1968 from abundant fossil leaves in the finer grained rocks.
In the northern part of the area, volcanic sandstone, siltstone, nnd conglomerate as much as 3,000 feet thick make up the Raging River Formation. These strata locally contain abundant marine fossils, including Foraminifera referable to the Bulimina jacf..'soncnsis zone of Ran and several species of Tttrritclla, Vcncrioan1ia, Pif.ar, and other mollusks. ~rhe characteristically dark gray sandstone beds are composed largely of reworked

volcanic material and commonly contain as much as 50 percent plagioclase feldspar and plagioclase-rich lithic grains.
As much as 2,000 feet of nonmarine sandstone and coal beds conformably overlies the Raging River Formation and is assigned to the Tiger Mountain Formation, the lowest formation in the Puget GrOUJl. The upper ·part of the Tiger Mountain Formation is interstratified with, and overlain by, the Tukwila Formation. The Tukwila Formation, about 6,800 feet thick, is made up of interbedded units of volcanic sandstone and siltstone, tuff, lapilli tuff, tuff-breccia, and volcanic conglomerate and relatively thin units of arkosic sandstone, carbonaceous claystone, and impure coal. The Tukwila Formation is conformably overlain by, and interfingers with, nonmarine arkosic sandstone, siltstone, and coal beds that make up the Renton Formation, at least 2,185 and possibly as much as 4,000 feet thick. The Renton Formation is the youngest formation in the Puget Group and is characterized by rather friable sandstone beds whose principal cement is kaolinite. The Renton Formation in the study area was a commercial source of coal and clay in the past and still contains large resources of both.
The Puget Group is conformably overlain by, and locally intertongues with, a thick section of unnamed volcanic rocks that farther east constitute most of the volcanic sequence in the southern Cascade Range. These rocks range from tuff, tuffbreccia, and lava flows on the east to volcanic sedimentary rocks on the west. Fossil leaves from the main lower part of the unnamed volcanic rocks were assigned to the upper Kummerian Stage of early Oligocene age. Locally, the Puget Group is unconformably overlain by flat-lying to gently dipping upper Tertiary sedimentary deposits, which occupy the same stratigraphic position but were never coextensive with the Hammer Bluff Formation of Miocene age. A generally northward trend of folding is evident in most of the Eocene and Oligocene rocl{S.
Pre-Vashon drift of Pleistocene age is exposed locally along the Cedar River, but most of the three-quadrangle area is blanketed by the Vashon Drift of Pleistocene age, which was deposited in the Puget Sound lowland by the last continental ice sheet as it moved south. The ice sheet was as much as 3,000 feet thick where it lay against the front of the Cascade Range, and it completely disrupted the normal drainage pattern from the mountains. During the recession of the ice, several meltwater rivers flowed across the area and left a series of broad gravel terraces and channels that are now abandoned. Many
glacial lakes were formed : some in depressions in the ground
moraine, others in l\:ettle holes. At least one temporary lake

was formed by an ice block in the valley of Issaquah Creek. Lake dej1osits include silt, sand, and, locally, peat.
Dn rl~-greenish-gray vorphyriti.c andesite sills, probably of Oligocene age, intruded the sedimentary rocks in many places. A greenish-gray vrophyritic hornblende andesite or dacite in Issaquah Canyon may be a volcanic vent related to the rocks of the Tukwila Formation.
Known resources of coal are estimated to be about 600 million tons, of which 78 vereent is bituminous and 22 percent is subbituminohs. Potential .coal resources are much greater and are estimated to be about 5 billion tons. The Renton Formation and the UlJlWr llart of the undifferentiated Puget Group contain the princi})al clay resources of the area. Deposits of outwash gravel in the Vashon Drift are important sources for sand and gravel. Construction stone, quicksilver deposits, silica-sand deposits, and petroleum prospects are of minor economic importance in the area.
INTRODUCTION
PURPOSE AND SCOPE OF INVESTIGATION
An investigation of the geology of Cumberland, Hobart, and Maple Valley quadrangles, IGng County, vVash., was begun in tTuly 1959 in cooperation with the Washington Department of Conservation, Division of Mines and Geology. The objectives of the project were fourfold: (1) to prepare a detailed map of the bedroek of the area, showing outcrops and geologic structure on a topographic base; (2) to determine the stratigraphic relation between the sequence of coal-bearing rocks in the Cumberland quadrangle on the south and. the dominantly volcanic rocks in the Hobart quadrangle on the north; (3) to map the coal beds and calculate the coal resources of the area; and (4) to examine the clay deposits and other mineral resources of the area and evaluate their potentiaL
Two preliminary reports (Wolfe and others, 1961; Vine, 1962b) and two preliminary maps (Vine, 1962a; Gower and 'Vanek, 1963) have been published as part of the eooperative project. A report describing the basis for, and the definition of, new floral stages has also been published (Wolfe, 1968).
LOCATION AND ACCESSIBILITY OF THE AREA
The Cumberland, Hobart, and Maple Valley quadrangles are in central western 'Vashington along the east margin of the Puget Sound lowland and the west flank of the Cascade Range. The central business district of Seattle is about 11 miles northwest of the nearest corner of the Maple Valley quadrangle and about 32 miles from the southeast corner of the Cumberland quadrangle (fig. 1). Near Preston, U.S. Highway 10 passes within half a mile north of the Hobart quadrangle. In

1961 the State Highway Department began construction of a new highway to connect U.S. Highway 10 near Preston with U.S. Highway 99 near Tacoma. The new road passes southwestward across the area from the northeast corner of the Hobart quadrangle to the southeast corner of the Maple Valley quadrangle (fig. 1). A network of State and county roads, many paved with asphalt, provide access to most of the lowland area. The most important of these are shown in figure 1. However, access to the upland is limited chiefly to private roads and roads maintained by Government agencies. Nounauthorized travel is permitted within the boundary of the city of Seattle Cedar River watershed. The area north of the watershed is administered jointly by the 'Vashington Department of Forestry and 'Veyerhaeuser Co., each of whom controls large parts of the land and access roads in the area.
FIELDWORK AND ACKNOWLEDGMENTS
A. A. Wanek, assisted by J. D. Vine and P. J. Pattee, began the fieldwork for the present investigation in July 1959. In 1960 J. D. Vine, H. D. Gower, and C. L. Rice continued the fieldwork. Vine and Gower each did additional fieldwork in 1961. D. C. Wiese and J(enji Sakamoto assisted in the laboratory and with the compilation of coal data. F. Stearns MacNeil and W. W. Ran rendered great aid in'identifying the invertebrate fossils and interpreting the age and environment of deposition. J. A. Wolfe joined the writer in the field to obtain additional collections of fossil leaves.
To the city of Seattle Water Department the writer expresses his thanks for access to the Cedar River watershed and for cooperation on numerous occasions. He also thanks the many others who provided access to restricted forest roads, especially John Buchanan, District Forester for the Washington Department of Forestry at North Bend, and Donald Dowling, Branch Forester for the Weyerhaeuser Co., Snoqualmie Falls Branch. The assistance of Ernest Seliger in locating several abandoned coal mines and obscure coal outcrops in the Cumberland quadrangle is appreciated. Thanks are also extended to the many private landowners, mine operators, and other individuals in the area whose courtesy and cooperation facilitated the investigation.
Unpublished data and the coal-mine maps of W. C. Warren and his associates were made available to the writer from their investigation of the l{ing County eoal fields in 1943 and 1944 as were the coal resource data and compilation sheets prepared for the recent detailed estimate of coal resources for the State (Beikman and others, 1961).

second growth is in various stages of development.

The Cumberland, Hobart, and Maple Valley quadrangle boundaries encompass a wide variety of landforms of little to moderate relief and, l'OCally, undrained depressions. Altitudes· in the area range from about 120 feet at the lowest point on the Cedar River to 3,004 feet at the 'top of Tiger Mountain. The western front of the Cascade Range forms a prominent escarpment that ranges in altitude from 1,400 to 2,700 feet along most of the east side of the Cumberland quadrangle. The Tiger Mountain-Taylor Mountain upland area, which extends in a northwesterly direction across the northern two-thirds of the Hobart quadrangle .and the northeast corner ·of the M·aple Valley quadrangle, is part of a western spur of the Cascade Range. These mountains, as well as many of the lesser outlying hills, owe their relief to the resistance of the underlying bedrock, whereas the subdued relief of most of the lowland areas is due to the cover of glacial deposits.
Two major rivers traverse the area and bring generally clear water from the snowfields and catchment

Within the first few years after an area has been logged, it can become a virtually impenetrable thicket of young trees, shrubs, and ferns. Blackberry thickets commonly spring up along the margins of clearings and may cover roads and mine dumps. Thickets of devilsclub (Oplopanax lwrridu.'Jn) form locally on saturated ground. In time, broadleaf trees, including vine maple (Acer circinaturn), red alder (Alnus o'regona) and bigleaf maple (Acer 'lnacrophyll;u,1n), become dominant and are gradually overshadowed in turn by the conifers, including western hemlock (Tsuga heterophylla). Douglas-fir and western redcedar eventually return to the logged-over areas, though not so quickly as some of the less valuable conifers.
ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT
Economic development of the Cumberland, Hobart, and Maple Valley quadrangles has been closely connected with the economic growth of Sellittle and Tacoma. Coal fields near the Green River and at Cedar Mountain were first developed early in the 1880's to

Farming is not so important in this area as in many others because the soils formed on glacial till are rocky and poorly drained, and those formed on glacial outwash gravel are excessively rocky and too permeable to hold moisture near the surface.

Detailed mapping and classification of Quaternary deposits, with emphasis on the engineering properties of various materials, have been completed in the Buckley quadrangle (Crandell ·and Gard, 1959) .and in the Reuton, Auburn, and Black Diamond quadrangles (Mullineaux, 1965a, b, c).
STRATIGRAPHY
RAGING RIVER FORMATION AND PUGET GROUP
Because of the marked difference in lithology and thickness of strata between the Tiger Mountain-Taylor Mountain upland area on the north and the Green River area on the south, the stratigraphic sequence is described separately for each area. The Green River area is described first because the floral stages established there provide a standard for comparison. In the Green River area the Puget ·Group was not subdivided in m·apping (pl. 1) because no stratigraphic markers were found to distinguish the units. Rocks exposed in the Tiger Mountain-Taylor Mountain upland area are nearly equivalent in age to the Puget Group in the Green River area but are about twice as thick and can be subdivided into four formations, three of which are included in the Puget Group. The fourth formation, the Raging River Formation, which forms the base of the exposed sequence on the north, was excluded from the Puget Group because it contains marine fossils. The three overlying nonmarine formations included in the Puget Group are, from oldest to youngest, the Tiger Mountain Formation, the Tukwila Formation, and the Renton Formrution. Of these, the Tiger Mountain and Renton Formations are most typical of the Puget Group as originally described (White, 1888, 1889 ; 'Villis, 1897, 1898a) . Rocks in the Tukwila Formation compose a wedge or tongue of epiclastic volcanic rocks within the coal-bearing sequence of the Puget Group.
GREEN RIVER AREA
PUGET GROUP
The Green River area includes almost all the Cumberland quadrangle. Although most of this area is underlain by the Puget Group, bedrock outcrops are limited because of the cover of Quaternary deposits. The best exposed outcrops of the Puget Group are in the central and southwestern parts of the Cumberland quadrangle,

where the Green River has cut a canyon 100-300 feet deep. These outcrops continue west about 2 miles into the Black Diamond quadrangle (Mullineaux, 1965c).
In the Green River area the Puget Group is composed of nonmarine sedimentary rocks containing coal beds that are locally useful as marker beds for stratigraphic and structural control. The group is about 55 percent feldspathic or arkosic sandstone, 35 percent siltstone, and 10 percent shale, carbonaceous claystone, coal, and minor conglomerate. The clastic rocks are generally poorly sorted, except locally in the upper part of the group.
The Puget Group is exposed in a series of folds that extends from the axis of the Lawson anticline to the axis of the Kummer syncline (pl. 1). The youngest rocks of the group crop out along the axis of the Kummer syncline; where they are overlain by unnamed volcanic rocks of Oligocene age. Although that contact is concealed in the canyon of the Green River, there is no evidence of an unconformity. The oldest rocks of the Puget Group occur along the axis of the Lawson anticline, but the base of the group is not exposed, and the total thickness is not known.
Many previous workers have measured stratigraphic sections along these folds. Willis (1897) ascribed .a thickness of 5,800 feet to Puget strata; Evans (1912, p. 42-49, pls. 18-20) made a transit survey and measured about 8,400 feet; Weaver (1937, p. 57-61) described in detail the transit survey made while he was assisting Evans; and Warren, Norbisrath, Grivetti, and Brown (1945) estimated the thickness to be at least 6,500 feet. The present writer found that the measurement by Evans (1912, p. 42-49) and Weaver (1937, p. 57-61) was accurate for the upper part but was too great for the lower part. The Puget Group exposed in the canyon of the Green River is estimated herein to be about 6,200 feet thick. The discrepancies have doubtless resulted from the difficulty in correlating strata on opposite limbs of folds in the absence of distinctive marker beds.
Evans (1912, p. 42) divided the rocks of the Puget Group exposed in the canyon of the Green River into three lithologic units which he called, beginning with the oldest, Bayne, Franklin, and l{ummer series. Weaver (1937) used the same divisions but classified them as formations instead of series. The boundary between the two younger units was defined by Evans as the base of a "light-colored massive sandstone with nodules or boulders of harder sandstone" which he called the Kummer sandstone. This sandstone underlies the l{ummer No. 0 coal bed and crops out in the canyon of the Green River on opposite limbs of the Kummer syncline. The boundary between the two older units was defined as the base of the "close-grained massive

sandstone" that crops out beneath the county bridge at the Green River Gorge, SW% sec. 17, T. 21 N., R. 7 E., and was called the Franklin sandstone by Evans. These units are not mappable outside the immediate vicinity of the canyon; however, two of the names have been preserved by grouping the coal beds in the Green River area into the n:::ummer and Franklin coal zones. The l(ummer coal zone is defined to include the coal beds that lie above the Kummer sandstone bed, and the Franklin coal zone is defined to include the coal beds that lie between the l(ummer and Franklin sandstone beds. No commercially important coal beds are known to lie below the Franklin sandstone bed.
S'Outhwest of 'Valker Lake the upper 300 feet of the Puget Group contains abundant volcanic debris, and the sandstone beds grade into, and intertongue with, the unnamed volcanic rocks. The contact is arbitrarily mapped at the top of the highest stratigraphic occurrence of quartz-rich micaceous sandstone. Along the road in the NE% sec. 33, T. 21. N., R. 7 E., west of 'Valker Lake, the transition from quartz-rich micaceous sa.ndst.one below to volcanic sandstone above occurs within a few inches. North of vValker Lake, a volcanic sandstone as much as 40 feet thick occurs about 650 feet stratigraphically below the top of the Puget Group. It is mapped as a tongue of unnamed volcanic rock within t.he Puget Group because of its distinctive lithology. Isolated outcrops of unnamed volcanic rock-
one east of Cumberland in the N"T% sec. 26, T. 21 N.,
R. 7 E.; another half a mile northwest of Bayne; and several in the area north and northwest of Sugarloaf Mountain-are also possibly tongues of volcanic rock within the Puget Group but cannot be d·istinguished from the main mass of post-Puget unnamed volcanic rocks. Directly south of the mapped area, near the cen-
ter of t.he "TYz sec. 6, T. 20 N., R. 7 E., the upper con-
tact of the Puget Group is exposed at the top of a hard claystone bed in the roadcut.
.:\composite stratigraphic section of the Puget Group, compiled from the exposures in the canyon of the Green R.iver, is described below and illustrated on plate 2. The thickness of each unit was estimated in the field, and the strike and the dip of beds were recorded for key points. The key points were plotted originally on aerial photographs and later transferred to the topographic map. Stratigraphic intervals between key points were Inter measured from geologic cross sections. The estimated thickness of each stratigraphic unit between key points was then adjusted to the intervals measured from t.he cross sections. Intervals between con l beds from the Harris bed to the Franklin No. 10 bed were measured directly from mine maps of workings adjacent to the Green River. l\f.easurements for other intervals were

made as follows: Base of section to top of Franklin No. 9 coal bed measured on "·est limb of Lawson anticline; top of Franklin No.9 coal bed to base of Franklin No. 10 coal bed measured on west limb of anticline in N'V% sec. 8, T. 21 N., R. 7 E.; Franklin No. 10 coal bed to Gem coal bed measured on west limb of anticline in NEY.t, sec. 19, T. 21 N., R.. 7 E.; Gem coal bed to top of the l(ummer sandstone bed measured south of Franklin fault on east limb of l(ummer syncline; top of the l(ummer sandstone bed to top of exposed section measured on west limb of syncline.
The sandstone beds range from very fine to coarse grained and locally granular, but fine-grained sandstone is probably most common. M~ost beds contain poorly sorted sandstone and 10-20 percent silt and clay in the ·matrix. Typically, the grains are subangular to subronnded. Although quartz is the dominant constituent, making up as much as 65 percent of the rock, feldspar is fairly abundant and makes up 10-40 percent of the rock. Quartz and feldspar together make up 8090 percent of the sand-size fraction. In general, plagioolase feldspar is most abundant in the lower part of the sequence, and potash feldspa.r is most abundant in the upper part. Lithic grains, including chert and rock fragments, generally constitute less than 10 percent of the rock. The more friable sandstone is cemented only by the finer grained minerals in the matrix, including clay, whereas the harder sandstone is generally cemented by authigenic ankerit~, calcite, or quartz. Some sandstone beds contain spherical and elliptical calcareous concretions and concretionary lenses. The concretions range from a few inches to 5 feet in diameter. Concretionary lenses are commonly 6 inches to 2 feet thick and 6-15 feet long. A bed of glauconitic sandstone 2-3 feet thick crops out in the canyon of the Greeil. River in the S'Vlti sec. 11, T. 21 N., R. 7 E., and in the strip pit on the Big Elk coal bed in the SWlti sec. 34, T. 22 N., R. 7 E. The glauconitic sandstone at both localities contains brackish-water mollusks.
Most sandstone beds in the Puget Group weather to massive cliffs. The internal stratification of these beds is commonly obscured by the weathered rind that forms on the surface, but. in general the coarser grained rocks are cross-stratified, and the cross-strata range from about 1 to 20 feet in length (fig. 2). The finer grained sandstone beds and siltstone beds are generally crosslaminated. or horizontally laminated. In places the siltstone beds are so inconspicuously stratified that they have a thick-bedded appearance. A thinly interbedded alternating sequence of different lithologies locally gives a striped appearance to the outcrop (fig. 3).
Convolute bedding was observed locally. Some sandstone beds are characterized by intraformational breccia

consisting of angular fragments of dark-gray sandy siltstone embedded in a, sandstone matrix. One intraformational breccia zone exposed in the canyon of the Green River in the NW1,4 sec. 8, T. 21 N., R. 7 E., is about 80 feet thick. Ripple marks were observed in only n, few places, probably because such features tend to be obscured by weathering.
Siltstone is generally medium to dark gray and sandy. Commonly, it occurs in beds as much as 2 feet thick interstrntifiecl with stnndstone. More rarely, siltstone beds occur as mnssiYe-weathering beds as much as 20 feet thick. Locally, siltstone is interlnminnted >Yith sandstone. Most siltstone is carbonaceous, and all gradations exist bet>Yeen carbonaceous siltstone, carbonaceous claystone, and impure coal. Carbonaceous siltstone associated with con 1 commonly contains \Yell-preselTecl fossil leaYes. Beds of soft carbonaceous claystone less than 1 foot thick are nlso associated ''"ith many of the coal beds.
A peculiar hard, brittle claystone occurs in beds as much as 17 feet thick at seYernl places in the Green River area. Its color varies with the amount of carbonaceous matter from light gray to very clark gray, but it is locally reddish brom1 because of siderite pellets. One characteristic common to most outcrops is subroundecl

light-gray spots 1-5 mm long. Kaolinite, gibbsite, and boehmite a.re the principal const~tuents of the clay-size fraction. Pellets of siderite as much as 1 mm thick make up as much as 35 percent of the rock. The claystone de.posits lmve been considered as potential ore for alumina (Nichols, 1946) and are mined at two localities for use in refractory clayware. Both the Kummer clay deposit in sec. 26, T. 21 N., R. 6 E., and the Blum clay deposit in sec. 31, T. 21 N., R. 7 E., both underlie the Kummer No. 0 coal bed and are therefore probably the same bed. PositiYe correlation with other beds has not been made.
The only beds of conglomerate, other than intraformational breccia, that " ·ere observed in the Puget Group in the Green RiTer area are composed of volcanic rock. ~\.volcanic. conglomerate 20 feet thick composed of subangular to snbroundecl pebbles and cobbles of porphyritic andesite (?) crops out south of Landsburg in the SW1;4 sec. 19, and NW~ sec. 30, T. 22 N., R. 7 E. This Led is similar to some beds in the Tukwila Formation and may ben tongue of that formation, but it is thought to be stratigraphically belmY the Franklin coal zone. Similar volcanic conglomera-te beds crop out in the canyon of the Green River. One is about 2 feet thick and is in the north-central part. of sec. 17, T. 21 N., R. 7 E.;

the other is about 1 foot thick and crops out in the SW:J4 sec. 9, T. 21 N., R. 7 E. Both beds are thoug-ht to 11nderlie the Franklin coal zone.
The stratigraphic positions of the principal coal beds in the canyon of the Green River are shown on plate 2. These are grouped into two zones designated the Franklin coal zone and the Kununer coal zone. Some individual coal beds can be traced as much as 2-3 miles beyond the canyon of the Green River, but many cannot be traced into isolated areas. Although the Kummer coal zone is largely confined to the Kummer syncline, the Sunset coal beds in the vicinity of Coal Creek, the beds northwest of Sugarloaf Mountain, and the beds near Palmer Junction may be correlative with it. Most of the other economically important coal beds in the Cumberland quadrangle probably correlate with the Franklin coal zone. A detailed description of the coal beds and their correlation is given in the section "Economic geology."

To better define the lithology and to find a means of subdividing the sequence, rock samples were collecteq from the undifferentiated Puget Group for laboratory study. Many petrographic techniques were used in testing, including magnetic-mineral-grain separation, staining of feldspar grains, and analysis of the clay-mineral fraction. Magnetic mineral grains were separated from disaggregated sandstone samples by use of a Frantz isodynamic magnetic separator. Magnetic minerals identified were chiefly ankerite and related cn,rbonate minerals plus mica, but a few grains of red garnet and black tourmaline were identified in samples taken from the upper part of the sequence. The feldspar staining of the disaggregated sandstone samples showed that plagioclase is several times more abundant than potash feldspar in the lower part of the sequence and that the reverse is trne in the upper part of the sequence.

The mineralogy of the clay-size fraction 1 was most useful in establishing lithologic zones within the Puget Group in the Green River area. Mostly sandstone beds were sampled, although a few finer grained rocks were also sampled. Samples were selected· primarily from outcrops of known stratigraphic position. An attempt was made to select samples representative of their strata, but this was not always possible. The study did show a very consistent change in the mineralogy of the claysize fraction from the bottom of the stratigraphic sequence sampled to the top. The samples and results are listed in table 1, and the clay minerals determined are shown graphically along the side of the stratigraphic column on plate 2.
The clay-mineral suite was found to change progressively with age through the stratigraphic sequence in the Green River area. Mica (illite) occurs throughout the sequence. In addition to mica (illite), the lower part of the Puget Group is characterized by about equal amounts of kaolinite, randomly interlayered illitemontmorillonite, and a regularly interlayered clay mineral which is probably chlorite-montmorillonite. Stratigraphically higher in the group, the regularly interlayered clay mineral is absent. At a still higher level, the randomly mixed illite-montmorillonite is absent, and kaolinite is more abundant. In the upper part of the sequence, montmorillonite occurs as a discrete mineral. Mica (illite) is absent in the overIying unnamed volcanic rocks, and kaolnite is a minor constituent; montmorillonite is the principal clay mineral in some areas, and chlorite the principal mineral elsewhere. Chlorite does not occur as a discrete mineral anywhere in the Puget Group of the Green River area.
The sedimentary rocks in the Puget Group of the Green River area were probably derived chiefly from the erosion of a granitic or metamorphic terrane. Beds of volcanic conglomerate and the volcanic material lo-
1 The laboratory procedure was as follows : A 10-30-g split of each rock sample was crushed t() a:bout -50 mesh, covered with distilled water in a 250-ml beaker, and placed in an Acoustica ultrasonic vibrator and stirred for about 10 minutes to keep the finer sediment in suspension. The suspended sediment was decanted, and' the coarse fraction was again covered with water and returned to the vibrator. This procedure was repeated until the decanted fluid was clear. The suspended fine sediment was placed in a centrifuge to settle the fraction larger than 2 microns. The remaining suspension was decanted and returned to the centrifuge to settle remaining particles larger than 0.2 microns. After decanting the excess water, a slurry was prepared of the claysize fraction (>0.2 and <2 microns) UJnd pl.aced on a glass slide to dry. The mineral .composition of the clay-size fraction w•s identified by using a Ph.lllps Norelco X-ray dil.ffra.ctometer equip.ped wi•th a. Geiger counter detector and continuous recording instrument. The slide was exposed to C()Piper Ka ra.dliation (X=1.5418 A) with a nickel fil:ter and scanned from 2" 20 t() 38° 20. ITbe observed peaks UJre rec()rded, in angstrom units, and the relative intensities of the peaks visually compared. Identification of the clay minerals followed, in general, the procedures outlined by Warshaw and Roy (1961). As many as four separate runs were made_,for the untreated. sample, for the glyc'Olated sample, and for samples heated to 400" C and then to 550" C.

cally mixed in the upper 300 feet of the Puget Group are exceptions; however, altered volC'an'ic rock occurs ·as partings as much as 2 feet thick in some coal beds below the Mcl(ay bed. The partings consist of fine-grained tuff to lapilli tuff and probably represent single episodes of volcanic activity during which volcanic ash fell upon the. accumulation of plant material in a coal swamp. Volcanic ash probably fell during the time intervals represented by sandstone and siltstone between con.l beds, too, but was so diluted by the nonvolcanic sediment that this ash is not classified as volcanic detritus in the field.
In the Green River area, Wolfe (1968) recog11ized a sequence of floral stages ranging in age from early Eocehe in the lower part of the Puget Group to early Oligocene in the basal part of the unnamed volcanic rocks that overlie the Puget Group. The lowest stage, the Franklinian Stage, includes all the rocks exposed in the canyon of the Green River below the base of the Franklin No. 11 coal bed. This stage includes the Chalk Bluffs flora (MacGinitie, 1941), which is the same age as the "Capay" Stage of the Pacific Coast standard marine sequence ('Veaver and others, 1944). The second stage, the Fultonian Stage, is divided into a lower and an upper part. The flora of the lower part of the Fultonian Stage is best represented in rocks directly overlying the Franklin No.12 coal bed and may be equivalent to the lower part of the "Domengine" Stage. The upper part of the Fultonian Stage includes beds from about 100 feet above the Franklin No.12 coal bed to the base of the Big Dirty coal bed and may be correlative \vith the upper part of the "Domengine" Stage. The third stage, the Ravenian Stage, includes rocks between the base of the Big Dirty coal bed and the base of the J(ummer sandstone bed. This stage is divided into a lower and v.n upper part. The lower part of .the Ravenian Stage ·includes the Mcl{ay coal bed and probably correlates with part of the "Transition beds" of the standard Pacific Coast section (Weaver and others, 1944). The upper part of the Ravenian Stage probably includes the "Tejon" Stage and the lowermost part of the J(easey Stage. The fourth stage, the J(ummerian Stage, is also divided into a lower and an upper part. The lower pa.rt includes all the rocks of the Puget Group in the canyon of the Green River above the base of the J(ummer sand-
stone bed and is equivalent to most of the lower part of
the Keasey Stage. It is regarded by 'Volfe as earliest Oligocene in age. The upper part of the J(ummerian
Stage is in the lower part of the unnamed volcanic rocks
that overlie the Puget Group in the canyon of the Green River and is believed to be equivalent to the uppermost
J(easey or lower "Lincoln." Therefore, it also is early

Oligocene in age. "rolfe (1968) describes in detail the basis for subdividing the Puget Group into floral stages and snoe·oO'ested their correlations with equivalent rocks in other parts of the west coast.
TIGER MOUNTAIN-TAYLOR MOUNTAIN UPLAND AREA
Sedimentary and volcanic rocks in the Tiger Mountain-Taylor Mountain upland area have an aggregate thickness of about 14,000 feet, more than twice that in t.he Green River area. l\iarine strata occur in the lower part, and volcanic detritus is abundant in the lower and middle parts. The presence of marine and volcanic rocks and the greater thiekness characterize the northern sequence a.nrl distinguish it as a different lithofacies from the sequence to the south.
RAGING RIVER FORMATION ·
The oldest sedimentary rocks in the Tiger MountainTaylor l\iountain upland area occur directly southwest of the Raging River (pl. 1). These rocks were not differentiated from other Eocene sedimentary strata or from the Puget Group by most early workers in the region, thong-h the lack of coal beds was noted. 'Varren Norbisrath, Grivetti, and Brown (1945) were the first to record marine fossils from these strata, and on the basis of a preliminary study of the fauna, they suggested a possible correlation with the Co"·litz Formation of southwestern ''Tashington. However, because of the wide geographic separation from other marine strata of Eocene age in western 'Vashington and the need to distinguish these rocks from the nonmarine strata of the Puget Group, these rocks were named the Raging R.iver Formation (Vine, 1962b, p. 7-11), after the Raging River which crosses the northeast. corner of the Hobart quadrang-le. The type area of the Raging River Formation is in sees. 9, 10, 15, and lf), T. 2:3 N., R. 7 E., 'Yhere streams tribnt.ary to the Raging River have eroded canyons throug-h the mantle of glacial drift and exposed some discontinuous rocky ledges (pl. 1). Less than 1,000 feet of strata is exposed continuously in any one outcrop, and the base of the formation is not exposed; therefore, the total thickness is not knmYn. By projection of outcrops into a generalized section, however, the thickness is estimated to be as much as 3,000 feet. This estimate of thickness is uncertain because outcrops ·are inadequate to deduce the pattern of faulting and because igneous intrusions occnr in the lmYer part of the Heqnence.
The principal outcrops of the Raging River Formation are on the southwest side of the valley of the Raging River and extend from U.S. Highway 10, about 2

miles north of the mapped area near the town of Pres-

ton, to the valley of Deep Creek on the south. The

outcrops are in a belt about 4 miles long and less tluin 1

mile wide. One small isolated outcrop of the formation

occurs about 1 mile west of this belt in a small anticline

at Tiger Mountain. Natural exposures are almost en-

tirely limited to stream canyons where the mantle of

glacial drift has been removed by recent erosion. A road-

cut on U.S. Highway 10 about 500 feet northwest of the

Preston overpass contains very fine grained hard sili-

ceous sandstone overlying an igneous sill. This sandstone

is similar to beds of .the Raging River Formation near

intrusive rocks i~1 the mapped area bnt is not typical of

the formation.

·

The Raging River Formation is characterized by mas-

sive· outcrops of thick-bedded siltstone, sandstone, and

conglomerate. The constituents of these clastic rocks are

dominantly of volcanic origin. Most outcrops of the fine-

grained rocks are extremely hard, especin.lly in :the

lower part of the formation, where the rocks have been

intruded by igneous sills. The medium- to coarse-grained

sandstone and chert-pebble conglomerate are locally

friable. In the lower part of the Raging River Forma-

tion, the strata next to the igneous sills have been partly

recrystallized to a rock that has an intergrannlar tex-

ture and is partly replaced by calcite and silica.

Metamorphic rocks, generally regarded as pre-

Tertiary in age, crop out about 4 miles northeast of the

mapped area, near North Bend. They unconformably

underlie the Tertiary sedimentary rocks there and

thi:oughout the northern Cascade Range. In the mapped

area the Raging River Formation may therefore un-

conformably overlie pre-Tertiary metamorphic rocks.

The contact of the Raging River Formation with the

overlying Tiger l\{onntain Formation was placed at the

top of a silty claystone nnit that is 160 feet thick and

contains marine mollusks and Foraminifera. where ex-

posed in a trench in the S"Tll.l, sec. 9, T. 23 N., R. 7 E.

Although the silty claystone is transitional with the

overlying unfossiliferous micaceous siltstone and sand-

stone, the contact is mappable.

The upper part of the Raging River Formation is

almost continuously exposed in the unnamed tributary

creek that flows northeastward across the Wlh sec. 9,

T. 23 N., R. 7 E., and in clay prospect trenches near the

southeast bank of the c.reek. A stratigraphic section was

measured along this creek and is described on page 57.

The 160 feet of silty claystone that forms the top

of the Raging River Formation is particularly well

exposed in the prospect trenches. A bed of sandstone,

about 3-5 feet thick, at the base of the silty claystone, ·

forms a distinctive marker because it has been altered

and recemented with a green mineral (celadonite or

glauconite) and contains abundant Turri.tella uvasana cf. subsp. hendoni Merriam and root tubes. This bed is continuous and easily recognized in the creek (altitude about 1,775 ft), in the prospect trench, and along the road for a distance of about 2,000 feet along the strike. Underlying the green cemented sandstone is about 500 feet of mostly very fine grained volcanic sandstone and siltstone. Except for 30 feet of horizontally stratified sandstone in the upper part, the strata throughout this part of the section are uniformly Inassive weathering, medium to dark gray, thick bedded, and well indurated and contain rather abundant marine fossils. The next underlying part of the section, about 250 feet thick (altitude about 1,565-1,665 ft), 'is distinctly coarser grained and more friable than the overlying part. The horizontally stratified ~mudstone· is generally medium to coarse grained, although locally it is granular to conglomeratic. Dark-colored chert pebbles are dominant in the conglomerate. Carbonaceous silty lami~ nae are locally present in the sandstone beds, but the strata are generally thick bedded and massive weathering. Beds of siltstone interstratified with the beds of sandstone. are also locally soft and friable. No fossils were found, and this part of the Raging River Format.ion could possibly be of nomnarine origi~l. However, the dominant horizontal stratification and the lack of crossbedding or channeling preclude a fluvial origin for these strata. Below the coarse-grained sandstone, and siltstone, glacia1 drift conceals an estimated 700 feet of strata. Farther downstream the strata exposed along this unnamed creek-from near the margin of the Hobart quadrangle northward for some distance into the Fall City quadrangle (from altitudes of about 1,170 to 800 ft) -have been intruded by igneous sills :1nd altered to n. hard compact rock. Erratic clips nnd shear zones suggest thnt the normal stratigraphic sequence has heen disturbed. For this reason, only a. small part of the strata exposed in the lower part. of the creek below ~the glacial drift are described in stratigraphic section 2.
Southeastward along the strike the top of the Raging River Formation is not exposed in the large tributary creek that flows east and northeast across the Nlh sec. 16 and the S'i\Tl;4 sec. 10, T. 23 N., R. 7 E. Anomalous dips and the structually low position of the Tiger Mountain Formation in the NE~4 sec. 16 suggest that the upper part of the Raging Ri,·er Formation has been
faulted or that there is unrecognized intertonguing of
Hthologies. 'Vhether faulting has duplicated or removed
part of the sequence has not been determined. Thick-
bedded dark-gray very fine grained sandstone and siltstone containing marine fossils are exposed along and
up the slope from the old logging .road that closely

parallels the 1,300-foot contour line on plate 1. In the creek bed at about the 1,420-foot contour (pl. 1)-near the section corner common to sees. 10 and 16-and extending downstream to about the 880-fo~t contour, ·a partial stratigraphic t:ection of the Raging River Formation can be observed. (See description on p. 58.)
A bed of medium-grained gray volcanic sandstone at an altitude of about 1,220 feet contains Cri8tispira pugetensis Allison, a turritellid. This species was also found, but in greater abundance, at locality 648 on the nose of the Raging River anticline, about 600 feet southwest of the center of sec. 15, T. 23 N ., R. 7 E. Although the precise stratigraphic position of locality 648 is not known, it is probably at least 1,000 feet below the top of the formation. If C. pttgetensis proves to have a narrow stratigraphic range, it may be possible to correlate its occurrences in stratigraphic section 3 and at locality 648. Moreover, if the C. pugetensis in stratigraphic section 3 is about 1,000 feet below the top of the formation, there must be several hundred feet of the upper part of the Raging River Formation missing, and the 700foot covered interval of stratigraphic section 2 must be
represented by part of stratigraphic section ?·
Farther southeast, part of the Raging River Formation is exposed in the channel of a :tributary that flows across the NWl!t, sec. 15, T. 23 N:, R. 7 E. Dark-gray very fine grained volcanic sandstone crops out where the old logging road crosses the creek, at an altitude of about 1,260 feet, and the outcrop continues upstream to an altitude of about 1,360 feet. Below the road the bedrock is mostly concealed clown to an altitude of about 1,030 feet, where a.n igneous sill is exposed. A second sill crops out at an altitude of about 960 feet, and there are e.xposures of altered sandstone between the two sills. Below the second sill, altered fine- to mediumgrained gray sandstone laminated with siltstone •and claystone are exposed down to about 870 feet. None of these strata have been correlated with strn.t:1 in the previously described sequences.
Upstream on the same creek, between altitudes of about 1,510 and 1,560 feet, nearly vertical beds of micaceous sandstone typical of the sandstone beds in the Tiger Mountain Formation crop out. Because these strata seem to be on strike with the Raging River Formation, they might represent a tongue of nonmarine rocks coming into the marine sequence; however, the
steep clips indicate concealed structural complications,
and the stratigraphic relations are uncertain.
Additional exposures of.the Haging River Formation
occur along the old logging road in tl1e west half of sec. 15, T. 23 N., R. 7 E. About 100 feet of inter-
bedded fine- to course-grained sandstone and chert-

pebible conglomerate crop out along the roadbank about 1,000 feet northwest of the center of sec. 15.' These rocks are similar to the beds of chert-pebble conglomerate nen.r the base of stratigraphic section 3 in SWl)J, sec. 10, but projection of the strike suggests that they are much higher stratigraphically. Dark-gray massive very fine grained to meditim-grained sandstone and siltstone of the Raging River Formation also crop out in cuts along the Bonneville Power Authority right-of-way, but these exposures were not correlated with a stratigraphic section.
Fossiliferous rocks of the R.aging River Formation crop out in n. small isolated area in the. core of a small
anticline on the south slope of Tiger Mountain, N"T%
sec. 17, T. 23 N., R. 7 E. These strata. have been intensely altered by hydrothermal solutions to kaolinized reddish, hematitic quartzose rock. Only the preservation of numerous marine fossils allowed these rocks to be recognized as Raging River Formation.
The Raging River Formation is characterized by horizontal stratification. Many outcrops along the streams are so thick bedded, massive, and well cemented that the strike n,nd dip are almost impossible to measure. Locn,lly, sandstone beds are laminated with siltstone or claystone. Such primary structures as ripple marks, cross-stratification, convolute bedding, channeling, and graded bedding were not seen.
Chert concretions were observed in a sandstone bed near the base of the sequence in stratigraphic section 3. Calcareous concretions about 1-5 em in diameter in siltstone or silty claystone occur in the highest unit in stratigraphic section 2 and also in the new highway cuts in the. south-central part of sec. 15, T. 23 N., R. 7 E. The cores of these concretions commonly con:tain fossil remains, such as fragments of crabs or echinoid shells. Spheroidal wea.thering occurs locally in outcrops of massive sandstone.
Though the rocks in the Raging Rive.r Formation range from claystone to conglomerate, very fine grained sandstone and siltstone are the most abundant rock types. Generally, the clastic gra.ins are angular and unsorted, and no clear distinction is apparent between clasts and matrix, except where the ma,trix has been preferentially altered or replaced. Plagioclase feldspar and lithic grains rich in plagioclase generally make up more than 50 percent of the sand-size fraction and may make up as much as 90 percent. Analysis of the plagioclase from one sample indicated a composition of An20• The large percentage of plagioclase and lithic grains indica;tes an origin from plagioclase-rich volcanic rocks; these rocks are therefore classified as volcanic sandstones or volcanic wacke$. The percentages of quartz

and chert grains, mafic materials, and opaque minerals vary ; grains of potash feldspar are rare. The coarsegrained sandstone beds and the pebble-conglomerate units contain a greater amount of chert grains than the finer grained rocks.
The matrix of friable sandstone !beds is chiefly chlorite, vermiculite, and kaolinite but includes limonite in the zone of weathering. The matrix of hard sandstone and siltstone beds also contains clay minerals, as well as variable amounts of quartz, calcite, and, locally, dolomite. In some rocks carbonate has replaced selected mineral gra.ins, and the petrographic study of thin sections showed carbonate to l·ange from 10 to 25 percent of the rock. X-ray diffraetometer studies showed quartz replacement of the matrix to be moderately common in most sa.mples. Carbonaceous fragments occur as opaque material, as films on mineral grains, and probably as a dispersed constituent of the matrix in many of the <iarker rocks.
Near igneous intrusions the proportion of quartz or calcite as cement and as a replacement of large mineral grains increases in the Raging River Formation. 'Vhere the formation is exposed on the south side of Tiger l\1ount.ain, the rock is almost entirely altered to quartz, clay, and iron oxides. P:irtial alteration to a green miueral related to celadonite or glauconite has occurred in a sandstone bed in the upper part of stratigraphic section 2. Individual grains show various degrees of alteration and replacement. Some gra;ns have been completely replaced by the celadonitelike mineral, and their original boundaries have been modified, apparently by swelling accompanied by radial fracturing. In other parts of the formation, the matrix and many of the plagioclase grains have more commonly been partly altered and replaced by chlorite or by a mixture of chlorite and vermiculite. In some places the chlorite is a swelling variety.
Marine echinoids, gastropods, pelecypods, scaphopods, and Foraminifera have been collected and identified from several horizons in the upper few hundred feet of the Raging River Formation. In addition, woody fragments of trees ~tnd leaves were found assoeiated with the marine fossils, but specific species could not be identifierl. Fossils were not found in the lower, more altered part of t.he sequence. Table 2 lists the megafossil forms that were identified in material studied by F. Stearns MacNeil (written commun., 1959, 1960). He-
ferring 'to this collection, he stated: "There seems to be
little question that this is a middle Eocene fauna." The megafossil collection was taken from the highest sandstone bed near the top of the Raging River Formation (fossilloc. 649). A claystone sample taken from about

Comparison of the fossil collections from the Raging River Formation with those from other Eocene marine strata in vVashington provides a suitable means for correlation but does not seem adequate to restrict the age of the form~ition to one or more of the informa1 Eocene subepochs-early, middle, and late. Most of the Raging River Formation is probably older than the Cowlitz Formation of southwestern 'Vashington that Henriksen (1956) regarded as late Eocene. I-Iowever, the Raging River Formation is probably equivalent to part. of the Mcintosh Formation of western 'Vash ington (Snanl.ly and others, 10;)1a), which ranges in age from middle to late Eocene in the Cent.ralin,-Chehalis area (Rau, 1D58) and is entirely of late Eocene age in the Doty-l\1inot Peak area (Pease and Hoover, 1957). 'Valdron (19G2) described mari1i.e and nonmarine volcanic sedimentary rocks of middle Eocene age in the Duwnmish Valley in the Des l\1oines quadrangle. These rocks probably cor-

with siltstone and coal beds. Evans regarded these rocks as part of the Puget Group but indicated (Evans, 1912~ p. 66) that the coal beds could not be correlated with those in any of the better known areas. Warren, Norbisrath, Grivett.i, and Brown (1945) mapped these rocks with the underlying marine rocks as Cowlitz ( ~) Formation. However, physical and fossil evidence indicates that this sequence correlates with rocks of the Puget Group in the Green River area. The sequence can be separated on the basis of lithology from the underlying Raging River Formation and from the overlying volcanic rocks. Vine (1962b, p. 12-13) therefore included these rocks in the Puget Group and named them the Tiger Th1ountain Formation. The type area for the Tiger l\1ountain Formation is on the east and southeast slopes of T'iger Mountain and on the north slope of Taylor l\1ountain, S'Vl}t sec. 9, sec. 16 Slh sec. 17, Nlf2 sec. 20, sec. 21, and sec. 22, T. 23 N., R. 7 E. This is an area of fairly steep dips and of discontinuous outcrops, so the stratigraphic sequence is incompletely known.
The contact of the Tiger Mountain Formation with the underlying Raging River Formation is exposed along the road to the Tiger Mountain lookout tower and in prospect trenches on the south side of the road, S"TlJJ,
sec. n, T. 2~ N., R. 7 E. The contact there is transitional
from marine fossil-benring clnystone below to nonmnrine micnceous sandstone above.
The upper part of the Tiger Mountain Formation intertongues with the partly equivalent and partly younger Tukwila Formation, nlso of the Puget Group~ '\There individual members of each formntion were mapped sepnrntely, the contacts nre conformable. The top of the highest member of the Tiger Mountain Formation is arbitrarily placed at the contact above which volcanic rocks predominate (pl. 2).
The Tiger Th1onntain Formation is known only from outcrops in the Tiger Th1ountain-Taylor Mountain up-
land area,, principally in the northeastern part of the I-Iobart qmu.lr;tngle. The belt of outcrops can be t.raced
a short distance northward into the Fall City quad-
l'l1ngle and eastward into the North Bend quadrangle.
In the Green R.iver area, about 10 miles to the south,
strata of eqnivn.lent age are mapped as part of the undifferentiated Puget Group. Strata of equivalent age do
not crop out in the mapped area west of Tiger Mountain. 'I'he Tiger l\1ountain Formation is exposed chiefly in
narrow canyons cut through the glacial drift by postglacin,l streams. Beds of sandstone form massive ledges
and cliffs along the steep canyon slopes; beds of siltstone, claystone, and coal are generally concealed by
Quaternary deposits, though a few scattered exposures occur in roadcuts and coal prospects.

North of Deep Creek, the Tiger Mountain Formation is exposed in scattered outcrops on both flanks of the Taylor syncline. The most complete sequence is exposed on the east flank, where the formation is about 2,000 feet thick, as described in stratigraphic section 4 (p. 58). In this section the stratigraphic interval from the base of ~ihe Tiger Mountain Form·ation to the top of its highest member is 2,825 feet, but in its upper part this interval includes •two members of the Tukwila Formation, which together are 825 feet thick.
The base of the Tiger Mountain Formation is not exposed on the south side of Deep Creek, and the lower strata are poorly exposed. The upper members, however, crop out between the more resistant ledges of the Tukwila Formation, with which these upper members. are interstratified, as shown in stratigraphic sections 5 (p. 59) and 6 (p. 60).
Sandstone in the Tiger Mountain Formation differs from that in the underlying Raging River Formation by the presence of mica flakes and the plant remains and by the absence of marine fossils. In general, the proportion of quartz to feldspar grains also increases. Throughout mo~t of the Tiger Mountain Form•ati0n the sandstone beds range from arkosic to locally quartzose, but mica flakes are generally present throughout. The mica ranges from muscovite to biotite and commonly is altered to chlorite. Grain size of the sandstone is mostly very fine to coarse and locally includes granules and pebbles; the average grain size is medium to coarse. The grains are generally angular to subangular and poorly sorted. Quartz makes up about 60 to 85 percent of relatively fresh rock and as much as 95 percent of hydrothermally altered rock. Locally, quartz content is as low as 20 percent in volc~nic sandstone. A typical sandstone of the Tiger Mountain Formation contains 10-30 percent feldspar; plagioClase is three to four times more abundant than potash feldspar. Other constituents are mainly micaceous minerals, ferromagnesia.n minerals, metallic minerals, and translucent to opaque grains, including chert. The matrix generally contains grains of the same minerals as compose the bulk of the rock plus interstitial fine-grained clayey minerals and carbonaceous matter. Calcite and other carbonate minerals generally make up less than 1 percent of the rock. Coalified fragments of woody material are abundant locally. In an exposure of member A along an old railroad grade west of the S% corner of sec. 17, T'. 23 N., R. 7 E., the grail'1s of the sandstone are coated with a black substance that contains both iron and carbon. This may he a dried organic extract, which could have been ·derived from coaly and carbonaceous siltstone beds in the Tiger Mountain Formation or possibly from bituminous matter in the ·Raging River Formation.

18 GEOLOGY AND COAL RESOURCES, CUMBERLAND , HOBART, MAPLE VALLEY QUADRANGLES, WASHINGTON

'Beds of sandstone in the Tiger Mountain Formation are generally cross-laminated ; the scale of crosslamination, including the length of cross strata and the thickness of sets, varies according to the average grain size of the rock Beds of coarse-grained sandstone and pebble conglomerate are associated with crosslaminat~d sets as much as 5 feet thick, whereas beds of fine- to medium-grained sandstone are crosslaminated in sets 0.5-1 foot thick Beds of siltstone are locally cross-laminated in sets less than 2 inches thick. The lower· bounding surface of the sets of cross strata is curved or planar and is generally not a surface of erosion (fig. 4), although trough-type cross strata with lower bounding surfaces of erosion are present locally. Horizontal stratification is also fairly common in the Tiger Mountain Formation, especially where finer grained sandstone and siltstone beds are interbedded (fig. 5). Current ripple marks and intraformational conglomerate, composed of angular to subrounded pebbles and cobbles of siltstone, are locally present in beds of sandstone.
Alteration of micaceous minerals to chlorite is common throughout the Tiger Mountain Formation. The

minerals of the matrix, however, include both chlorite and montmorillonite in most of the area. Also, kaolinite characterizes the matrix of the Tiger Mountain Formation in the area between the axis of the Taylor syncline and the Tiger Mountain fault (pl. 1). The kaolinite is thought to be related to the hydrothermal alteration that is most intense next to the Tiger Mountain fault. The hydrothermal alteration is accompanied locally by an increase in the proportion of quartz to feldspar, probably as a result of the alteration of feldspar to kaolinite and perhaps also from the addition of some silica.
Fossil plants are rather abundant in the Tiger Mountain Formation, but only in a few of the clayey siltstone beds were the leaf impressions satisfactory for the detailed identification and classification necessary for stratigraphic control. Leaf impressions in sandstone beds are generally too coarsely textured for_ generic or specific identification; those in carbonaceous claystone and coaly beds are generally too matted for separation. Two fossil-leaf localities (USGS paleobot. locs. 9813, 9814) about 1% miles apart and nea,r the top of the main body of the Tiger Mountain Formation contain

excellent leaves preserved as thin films of carbonaceous material. The leaves may oocur in the same bed, but the bed could not be traced across the intervening distance. The leaf collections " ·ere described by .T. A. " Tolfe (1968); he indicated that they are probably equivalent in age to the upper part of the Fultonian Stage
The upper tongues of the Tiger Mountain Formation are inte-rstratified "·ith rooks of the Tukwila Formation that contain plant fossils from the lo,Yer part of the Ravenian Stage. Thus, the known range of the Tiger Mountain Formation is from the late Fultonian Stage through the early Ravenian Stage. Therefore, the base of the Puget Group in the Tiger Mountain-Taylor Mountain area, as defined by the base of the Tiger Mountain Formation, is younger than the lower part of the Puget Group in the Green River area, where Wolfe (1968) recognized the Franklinian Stage. Although direct correlation between stages defined in terms of marine fauna and those defined in terms of plant fossils

is imprudent, the Raging River Formation likely includes the northern equivalents of the Franklinian Stage of the Green River area. Restricting the Puget Group to the nonmarine strata in the Tiger MountainTaylor Mountain area thus shortens the age range of the Puget Group to younger rocks. The definitions of the informal terms early, middle, and late Eooene are slightly different, depending on whether they are defined in terms of marine megafossils, Foraminifera, or plant fossils. Thus, it seems best not to define the age of the Tiger Mountain Formation in these terms.
'l"UKWILA FOltMATIO::"i
Volcanic rocks exposed near the town of Tukwila in sees. 11 and 14, T. 23 N., R. 4 E., south of Seattle " ·ere named the Tukwila Formation by 1Valdron (1962). He. described the Tub...-ila Formation in the type area as consisting mostly of volcanic sandstone, siltstone, and shale, but including some volcanic

20 GEOLOGY AND COAL RESOURCES, CUMBERLAND, HOBART, MAPLE VALLEY QUADRANGLES, WASHINGTON

conglomerate, tuft', tuffaceous sandstone and siltstone, and a few beds of carbonaceous shale. He estimated the Tukwila Formation to be more than 2,500 feet thick. About 500-750 feet below the top of the formation, vValdron distinguished an arkosic unit similar to the overlying Renton Formation. Although the base is not exposed, the contact of the Tukwila Formation with underlying marine and nonmarine sedimentary rocks of middle Eocene age is thought to be a fault. The Tukwila Formation is interstra.tified with, and conformably underlies, the Renton Formation near Seattle, and "\Valdron inc.luded both formations in the Puget Group. This interstratified relationship between the volcanic and nonvolcanic rocks had previously been mapped by "Tanen, Norbisrath, Grivetti, and Brown (1945), who designated the volcanic rocks as a volcanic series of Eocene age.
The principal belt of outcrops of the Tukwila Formation lies along a series of low mountains and hills that extend intermittently west-northwest from the Cascade Range to Lake "\Vashington and 'include Taylor Mountain, Tiger Mountain, West Tiger Mountain, Squak Mountain, and Newcastle Hills. The Tukwila Formation also crops out no11theast of Issaquah, in the vicinity of Grand Ridge, and in the area south of Seattle, near Renton and Tukwila (Waldron, 1962; Mulline~.ux, 1965a). The Tukwila Formation is known to occur only in· part of the area underlain by the Puget Group and is not continuous with volcanic rocks known elsewhere in strata of equivalent age. For example, in the Buckley quadrangle about 25 miles south of Tiger Mountain, Crandell and Gard (1959) mapped a bed 100 feet thick of brown andesite pebble-and-cobble conglomera;te within the Puget Group. They be1ieved that the andesitic material came from a local source west of the Buckley quadrangle. The source may have been the same as that of the Northcraft Formation of late Eocene age in the Centralia-Chehalis area (Snavely and others, 1951b, 1958), which, though derived from n, separate volcanic center, may be partly equivalent in age and similar in lithology to the Tukwila Formation.
The Tukwila Formation is as much as 6,800 feet thick in the Tiger Mountain-Taylor Mountain upland ~rea but abruptly thins to the southwest. To the north the Tukwila Formation dips under a thick cover of younger rocks and glacial drift. The relation between the Tukwila Formation and the younger volcanic rocks to the east has not been determined.
In the Tiger Mountain-Taylor Mountain upland area, many of the highest hills and most resistant ledges are underlain by the Tukwila Formation. This is largely due to the resistance of" these rocks to erosion and to a lesser

extent to the presence of igneous rocks that have intruded the Tukwila. Thick massive beds of tuff-breccia are especially hard when fresh, and they form many ledges along the southeast side of the canyon of Issaquah Creek, on "\Vest Tiger Mountain, on the west flank of South Tiger Mountain, and in the canyon of Holder Creek.
The Tukwila Formation in the Tiger Mountain-Taylor Mountain upland area consists chiefly of volcanic sandstone and siltstone, tuff, lapilli tuff, tuff-breccia, and volcanic conglomerate. In this area the Tukwila also includes at least four lenticular beds about 25 to 200 feet thick consisting of arkosic sandstone, carbonaceous claystone, and impure coal. Volcanic flow rocks are present but not so abundant. The thickness from the base to the top of the Tukwila Formation can be estimated with any degree of reliability only on Taylor Mountain. In estimating the thickness of the formation, no allowance was made for the possibility that the observed dip could be primary. If the observed dip is primary, the true thickness at a specific locality would be less. In the area· between Tiger Mountain and Issaquah, the thickness of the Tukwila Formation may be greater than estimated, but the lower part of the sequence is faulted out.
The sequence of rocks in the Taylor Mountain area is described in stratigraphic section 6 (p. 60), ·which is a composite section of smaller intervals measured between the principal marker beds (designated beds C, D, E, and F) and the upper and lower contacts. In general, the upper strata are characterized by medium- to coarsetextured rocks such as tuff-breccia, lapilli tuff, ::-nd volcanic conglomerate (figs. 8, 10), whereas the lower strata are characterized by volcanic sandstone, tuffaceous siltstone (fig. 6), and local lenses of coarse-textured rocks. The coarse-textured rocks are generally thicker and more continuous west. and northwest of Taylor Mountain, and they compose a fairly large part of the exposed sequence on "\Vest Tiger Mountain.
Primary sedimentary structural features, including lamination, cross-lamination, convolute bedding, and slump structures, are readily apparent in tuffnceous siltstone where partly silicified, as shown in figure 6. A thin section perpendicular to the lamination of the specimen illustrated in figure 6 shows that the average grain size is about 0.01 mm and that concentrations of dark minerals only a few grains thick form some of the laminae. Some beds of volcanic sandstone have a mottled appearance owing to irregularities in grain size, sorting, or cementation. Stratification is inconspicuous in most of the volcanic rocks in the Tukwila Formation, but the arkosic micaceous sandstone marker beds are locally well bedded, particularly where concentrations of mica 1xuallel the bedding. Beds of lapilli tuff and tuff-

breccia commonly appear to be massive but may show a local bedding-plane concentration of rock fragments or a friable zone between adjacent units. An upright fossil tree trunk visible in a roadcut on U.S. Highway 10 about 3 miles east of the intersection with the main street of Issaquah (fig. 7) appears to be rooted in a friable zone. This suggests that the friable zone may represent a fossil-soil horizon. Similar carbonaceous and siliceous fossil tree trunks, as well as bYigs, stems, and leaves, are relatively common in the tuff-breccia.
In many places the beds of tuff-breccia are so ''ell indurated that they will break across rock fragments

and matrix alike (fig. 8). The individual rock fragments and the matrix are generally similar in composition, which gives the rock a nearly uniform texture and makes recognition of rock fragments difficult. A polished or thin section of the tuff-breccia generally facilitates the identification of rock fragments and matrix, as shown in figure 9. Distinctly sharp contacts between rock fragments and matrix indicate no welding or fusion of the rocks fragments and the matrix. Beds of volcanic conglomerate are distinguished from beds of tuff-breccia

by the fact that the boulders in the conglomerate tend to weather out in their original shape (fig. 10). The matrix of the volcanic conglomerate is generally more frivble and less resistant to weathering.
Plagioclase feldspar is the most common mineral in the Tukwila Formation and is characteristic of almost all rock types from tuffaceous siltstone to tuff-breccia, it constitutes more than 50 percent of many vohanic rock types. Zoned plagioclase phenocrysts in tuff-breccia and lapilli tuff generally range in composition from An20 to An30• Hornblende is the most common mafic mineral identified, but in many rocks the mafic minerals have been altered beyond recognition and are replaced by chlorite, opaque minerals (including magnetite), and, locally, calcite. The fine-grained groundmass of most of the volcanic rocks consists of a microcrystalline intergrowth of altered plagioclase laths, quartz, chlorite, calcite, and opaque minerals. In contrast to the more abundant volcanic rocks, the micaceous sandstone

marker beds and their associated carbonaceous rocks are like the rocks in the Tiger Mountain Formation. The mica in them is commonly brown, green, or black and is chloritie. The sandstone is generally nrkosic.
Dark-gray hypocrystalline rocks 1-6 feet thick arc locally interstratified with sedimentary and volcanic rocks in the middle and upper parts of the Tukwila Formation. These rocks, probably basaltic in composition, are commonly vesicular and contain needles of plngioclase 1-3 mm long in a microcrystalline groundmass. Although these rocks form locally conspicuous ledges, it is not known whether they are flows or sills.
A tuff-breccia exposed in a new roadcnt about 1 mile north of Hobart afforded an unusual opportunity to study a fresh exposure of the Tukwila Formation. Table 4 gives the chemical ·analysis of a rock sample from this exposure.

tain- show some alteration to kaolinite and silica. Tiger Mountain, for example, is underlain by tuffaceous siltstone that has been silicified to form a porcellanite in some areas, and elsewhere, chiefly kaolinite. Locally, volcanic sandstone beds have been altered almost completely to chlorite but have retained the original porous texture of a sandstone.
Fossil-leaf impressions, both flat and curled, and casts of E quisetwm nodes are locally abundant in tuffaceous siltstone and fine-grained volcanic sandstone of the Tukwila Formation. J. A. Wolfe studied the fossil leaves from the following four localities in the Tukwila Formation of this area :

All exposures of the Tukwila Formation in the mapped area are at least partly chloritized, and in many areas surface weathering has further modified the original rock to massive saprolite.

The strata at localities 9685, 9686, and 9687 probably are assignable to the lower Ravenian Stage (pl. 2), whereas the strata at locality 9815 may be as young as the late Ravenian Stage. In the Fall City quadrangle, leaf fossils were collected from the Tukwila Formation exposed in a roadcut along the south side of U.S. Highway 10 in the NEl4SWl4 sec. 30, T. 24 N., R. 7 E. (USGS paleobotany loc. 9738). Wolfe (1968) included this collection in the late Ravenian Stage. Previous collections of fossils from the Tukwila Formation include the so-called "Steels Crossing" locality 8640, near the city of Renton, which Wolfe included in the early Ravenian Stage. Thus, the Tukwila Formation is mostly of late Eocene age in the areas mapped. However, fossil plants collected by \iV. C. vVarren from locality 9035, in the NW%SE14 sec. 2, T .. 23 N., R. 5. E., along the side of the May Creek road, have been assigned by Wolfe to the early Kummerian Stage. If these rocks are continuous with the Tukwila Formation, then an earliest Oligocene age may be possible for the top of the Tukwila Formation.
RENTON FORMATION
Waldron (1962) named the coal-bearing rocks exposed in the city of Renton, about 4 miles west of the Maple Valley quadrangle, the Renton Formation. D. R. Mullineaux ('uitten commun., 1962) estimated that in the type area the Renton Formation is about 2,500 feet thick. It conformably overlies the Tukwila Formation and consists of fine- to medium-grained arkosic and and feldspathic sandstone and lesser amounts of siltstone, sandy shale, coal, and carbonaceous shale. No fossils were reported from the type area. \iVarren, Norbis-

24 GEOLOGY AND COAL RESOURCES, CUMBERLAND, HOBART, MAPLE VALLEY QUADRANGLES, WASHINGTON

rath, Grivetti, and Brown (1945) mapped these coal-bearing rocks overlying their Eocene volcanic series as the Puget Group. Structure section A-A' on their map shows about 2,500 feet of strata of the Puget Group in the Newcastle area, where the rocks dip northward beneath unnamed Oligocene and Miocene marine sedimentary rocks.
·South of Taylor Mountain the Tukwila Formation is conformably overlain by at least 2,185 feet of coalbearing strata similar to those of the Renton Formation at Renton. Rocks in a similar stratigraphic position are designated as the Renton Formation near Cedar Mountain and in the Fifteenmile Creek area, although the contacts with overlying and underlying rocks are concealed in these areas. Thus, the areal distribution of the Renton Formation is similar to that of the Tukwila Formation. The Renton crops out intermittently from the type area south of Seattle to the Cascade Range. The north limit of the Renton Formation is uncertain because the formation dips beneath younger rocks and Quaternary deposits west of Issaquah. The Renton Formation cannot be recognized with certainty south of the Hobart quadrangle, although rocks in the upper part of the Green River section of the Puget Group in the Cumberland quadrangle are lithologically similar and largely equivalent in age.
The contact of the Renton Formation on the underlying Tukwila Formation is probably everywhere conformable. Where exposed north of Taylor, near theN~ corner of sec. 3, T. 22 N., R.·7 E., the contact is sharp, but at an outcrop along Webster Creek, half a mile to ~he west, it is transitional. The contact of the Renton Formation with younger unnamed volcanic rocks is not exposed anywhere in the mapped area. Mullineaux (1965a) showed it as disconformable elsewhere. In the Fifteenmile Creek ·area no angular discordance is evident between the Renton Formation and the isolated outcrop of unnamed volcanic rocks about three-quarters of a mile to the west.
The Renton Formation is characterized in the mapped area by fresh- and brackish-water sedimentary rocks that are generally more friable than the older strata in the Puget Group. The Renton Formation is readily distinguished from the enclosing formations by its lack of volcanic debris. Fine- to coarse-grained or granular feldspathic and arkosic micaceous sandstone is interstratified with siltstone, carbonaeeous claystone, and coal beds in the Renton.
Compared with older sandstone beds of the Puget Group, those of the Renton Formation contain more quartz, potash feldspar, white mica, and kaolinite, but less plagioclase, colored mica, carbonate cement, and

hydrous clay minerals. Quartz and feldspar are the principal mineral grains in the formation. Feldspar constitutes 15-40 percent of the sand-size grains and consists of nearly equal proportions of plagioclase and potash feldspar. The matrix in nine out of 11 samples ·of sandstone, siltstone, and claystone from the Renton Formation was found to contain abundant kaolinite and minor amounts of mica (illite) , montmorillonite, and other clay minerals. Of the other two samples, one contained abundant mica (illite), and the other, more montmorillonite than kaolinite. Carbonate cement is mainly concentrated in concretions that are locally as much as 5-10 feet long and 0.5-2 feet thick.
Horizontal lamination (fig. 11) is characteristic of the siltstone and claystone beds, whereas cross-lamination and ripple marks, though locally inconspicuous, are common in the sandstone beds. Conglomerate, which contains pebbles composed principally of siltstone, is fairly abundant. The strata are light gray to gray when fresh but weather pale yellowish gray to brown.
The Renton Formation in the Taylor area is described in stratigraphic section 7 (p. 60), was compiled from previously published data, mine records, and measurements of scattered outcrops. Most of the conspicuous ridges of the Renton Formation in the Taylor syncline are formed by ledges of sandstone and igneous sills, as described in the stratigraphic section. The valleys are underlain by fine-grained clastic rocks and coal beds. Very sparse surface data in this area make correlation with subsurface data uncertain. For example, Weaver (1916, p.121-122) described a detailed section of rocks 1,414 feet thick in the main crosscut tunnel of the Taylor mine. The only coal bed he identified was the number 7, but this is probably not the same bed as the coal bed identified as the No. 7 in this report..
Near Cedar Mountain, the canyon eroded by the Cedar River provides one of the few exposures of the Renton Formation in the Maple Valley quadrangle. Evans (1912) stated that the rocks exposed in this area n,re about 2,000 feet thick However, summation of the stratigraphic intervals given by Evans supplemented with mine data and new data from scattered outcrops indicates a thickness of about 1,550 feet for strata exposed in the eanyon area and penetrated in the adjacent mine workings, as shown in stratigraphic sect•ion 8 (p. 61). 'Veaver (1916, p. 119) described 1,492 feet of strat.a from the same area, hut t:he one coal bed included in his section ·is not identifiable and cannot. be eorrelated with section 8.
'Vest of the older mine workings at Cedar Mountain is another stratigraphic sequence about 2,900 feet thick

that includes at least six coal beds. The total thickness may be 4,000 feet, if the approximately 1,100 feet of strata exposed near the south end of Lake Desire is a continuous stratigraphic sequence above the youngest coal bed. C'oal beds have not been correlated across the faults that separate the two parts of the Cedar Mountain district. The apr>roximate stratigraphic intervals separating the bases of coal beds in the western part of the Cedar Mountain area, as calculated from the mine maps, are as follows: New Lake Young coal bed to Ryan No. 1 coal bed, 850 feet; Ryan No. 1 coal bed to Ryan No. 2 coal bed, 280 feet; Ryan No. 2 coal bed to Discovery coal bed, 680 feet; Discovery coal bed to Jones (Slope) coal bed, 130 feet; and Jones (Slope) coal bed to Cavanaugh No. 2 coal bed, 975 feet.

Renton Formation consist of at least 700 feet of friable arkosic micaceous sandstone, siltstone, carbonaceous claystone, and coal These rocks are separated from the Tukwila Formation to the north by an east-trending fault. Three coal beds-the Tiger Mountain Nos. 1, 2, and 3, from youngest to oldest-are a:bout 400, 515, and 600 feet, respectively, below the top of the exposed sequence. The Tiger Mountain No. 3 coal bed is about 100-700 feet above a thick sill. According to the old mine records, this interval contains two or more additional coal beds; one, described as anthracitic, may have been increased in rank by the heat of intrusion. The existence of these lower coal beds could not be verified because of the ~over of glacial drift. At least two other small sills have been intruded into the coal-bearing part of the sequence, but they seem to be much more limit~d in extent than the lower sill, which may be more than 400 feet thick. The lower sill is underlain by sandstone.

Strata of locality 9729, in the Taylor coal field, were assigned by Wolfe (1968) to the upper Ravenian Stage. Strata at locality 9730, a roa.dcut near Cedar Mountain,
and locality 9688, a roadcut about llh miles west of Is-
saquah, conta.in leaf fossils that 'Volfe assigned to the late l(ummerian Stage. Thus, in the Hobart., Maple Valley, and Issaquah areas, the Renton Formation ranges from late Eocene to early Oligocene in age. In addition to lea.£ fossils, the rocks in the Renton Formation locally contain several species of fresh- or brackish-water mollusks. Fossil mollusks were collected from two localities, as given in table 5. In reference to the fossil collections, F. Stearns MacNeil stated (written commun., 1959) that the association of Potamides le1oisiana and 0 orbicula olequahensis was reported by C. E. 'Veaver from beds he referred to as the Cowlitz Formation of late Eo,eene age. They are probably of brackish-,Yater origin. The two forms of Batis8a may be variants of one species. They have been described from the Puget Group, but elsewhere the genus is known chiefly from East Asia and Oceania. These two species probably inhabited fresh water.

dicate, however, that most of the 6,000 feet of strata in the Green River area correlates with most of the 14,000 feet of strata in the Tiger Mountain-Taylor Mountain upland area (fig. 12; pl. 2), although some minor exceptions may exist. The oldest rocks in the Green River area are assigned to the Franklinian Stage, which probably is older than any of the fossil-bearing rocks to the north, but the fossil-bearing rocks in the north are underlain by several hundred feet of altered strata in which no fossils were found. The youngest rocks in the undifferentiated Puget Group in the Green River area are assigned to the early Kummerian Sta.ge of earliest Oligocene age, whereas rocks as late as the late Kummeria.n Stage of early Oligocene age are found in the Renton Formation. Despite these slight differences in age, the rate of accumulation of sediment apparently was nearly twice as fast in the north as in the south.
Fresh- or brackish-water pelecypods, such as Batissa~ occur in the Renton Formation, as well as in the undifferentiated Puget Group to the south. The pelecypod occurrence indicates that, except for the Raging River Formation, deposition took place close to sea level in both areas and that subsidence kept pace with deposition of the sediment, as noted by 'Villis (1886, p. 759). The change in thickness and lithology of the Puget Group and the Raging Rive·r Formation from the Green River area to the Tiger Mountain-Taylor ~fountain up-

relates with the Renton Formation, contains montmorillonite as a common minor constituent. Montmorillonite is far less common in the Renton Formation; therefore, the probable source for it was to the south and east, where unnamed volcanic rocks intertongue with the upper part of the Puget Group. Because the northern and southern facies are so dissimilar, it can be inferred that the hinge line between the two facies also represents n. barrier across which very little sediment was transported.
Bressler (1957) presented evidence that sedimentary rocks equivalent in age to the Puget Group that occur east of the Cascade Range were formed of sediments largely derived from a lower Tertiary crystalline highland whose center was near the '~Tenatchee Mountains. There, the Mount Stuart Granodiorite of pre-Tertiary age was uplifted in L~tte Cretaceous or early Tertiary time and provided the source for most of the arkosic detritus in the Swank and Roslyn Formations. The Cascade Range was not formed until later, so the streams draining this highland flowed westward across a broad flood plain before reaching the sea. Deposits on this flood plain form the Puget Group. Local volcanic cen-

ters like the Tiger Mountain-Taylor Mountain upland area interrupted the otherwise uniform flood plain. The eastward embayment of marine rocks in the Raging River Formation seems to coincide with the somewhat later accumulation of volcanic material in the Tukwila Formation. Both were probably deposited during the same rapid subsidence that was accompanied by outpourings of volcanic material.
A northwest-trending fault zone with large lateral displacement could be proposed as an alternative to the hinge-line hypothesis, and the lateral displacement would explain the apparent lack of mixing between the northern and southern facies. Evidence of faulting is abundant on the south sides of Squak and Tiger Mountains, but there is no field evidence other than the marked difference in lithologic facies to suggest that these faults have large lateral displacement.
UNNAMED VOLCANIC ROCKS
Interstratified with, and conformably overlying, the Puget Group in the Cumberland, Hobart, and Maple Valley quadrangles is a thick sequence of volcanic rocks informally referred to as unnamed volcanic rocks. These

28 GEOLOGY AND COAL RESOURCES, CUMBERLAND, HOBART, MAPLE VALLEY QUADRANGLES, WASHINGTON

rocks range from andesitic tuff-breccia, tuff, and flow rocks near the southeast corner of the Cumberland quadrangle to fluvial volcanic sandstone, conglomerate, and tuff near Black Diamond. Similar rocks along the west margin of the Cascade Range were named the Enumclaw Volcanic Series by Weaver (1916, p. 84,232235), but this name was not precisely defined, and, so far as is known, the name has not been used by other workers. Smith and Calkins (1906, p. 8) gave the name Keechelus Andesitic Series to upper Tertiary volcanic rocks that they mapped along the crest of the Casc~de Range. Warren Norbisrath, Grivetti, and Brown (1945) extended the name l(eechelus Andesitic Series to the intrusive and volcanic rocks of post-Puget age in the area of this report. Sev.eral other workers (Coombs, 1936; Fisher, 1954; and Crandell and Gard, 1959) also extended the name to volcanic rocks that interfinger with and overlie the Puget Group on the west side of the Cascade Range. 'Vaters (1961) showed that the rocks originally included in the l(eechelus Andesitic Series are younger than those subsequently assigned this name and that extension of the name to include older rocks is unwarranted. Therefore, the older volcanic rocks formerly assigned to the l(eechelus Andesitic Series by Warren, Norbisrath, Grivetti, and Brown (1945) are included in the unnamed volcanic rocks of this report.
Where exposed near the southeast corner of the Cumberland quadrangle, the unnamed volcanic rocks are about 5,000 feet thick and consist of stratified tuff, lapilli tuff, tuff-breccia, flow breccia, platy to massive flow rock, and lesser quantities of volcanic sandstone and siltstone. These rocks form the conspicuous escarpment more than 1,200 feet high east of Walker Lake. Small isolated exposures of unnamed volcanic rocks occur (1) in the southwest corner of the Cumberland quadrangle, (2) half a mile northwest of Bayne, (3) north of Sugarloaf Mountain in sees. 28, 29, and 34, T. 22 N., R. ·7 E., (4) west of Landsburg in the NEI4 sec. 23, T. 22 N., R. 6 E., and (5) along Fifteenmile Creek in the Slh sec. 14, T. 23 N., R. 6 E. In addition, these rocks probably underlie much of the drift plain in parts of the Maple Valley and Hobart quadrangles.
In the southwest. corner of the Cumberland quadrangle, north and east of Bass Lake, the unnamed volcanic rocks consist chiefly of volcanic sandstone and
conglomerate and locally contain abundant fossil plant
remains. The outcrop west of Bayne is lapilli tuff and
tuff-breccia. The outcrops north of Sugarloaf Moun-
tain are principally tuff-breccia but also include some volcanic flows. The outcrop in the canyon of the Cedar
River west of Landsburg consists of volcanic sandstone
interbedded with basaltic flow breccia and a platy flow

that is exposed during periods of low water. The outcrop in Fifteenmile Creek near the northeast corner of the Maple Valley quadrangle consists of deeply weathered volcanic pebble conglomerate and tuff. These sedimentary volcanic rocks are composed of relatively unstable minerals and readily weather to a soft, brown saprolite.
The clastic volcanic rocks are generally composed of plagioclase grains of about the composition of andesine, volcanic rock fragments, and subordinate grains of augite and hornblende in a chloritized matrix. lVIan)' of the larger grains have also been chloritized. Thi~ alteration is reflected in the color of the rocks, which are grayish yellow green, dusky yellow green, or pale olive. The flow rocks are generally medium-dark-gray to dark-gray porphyritic andesite with pilot.axitic textures. Phenocrysts 5-20 mm long, consisting of euhedral to subhedral zoned plagioclase (chiefly andesine) and accessory augite, are scattered in a microcrystalline groundmass of plagioclase and dark minerals.
'Varren, Norbisrath, Grivetti, and Brown (1945) mapped unnamed marine rocks of Oligocene and Miocene age west of Issaquah that consist of volca1iic sandstone and tuff beds and are similar, except for the presence of marine fossils, to the unnamed volcanic rocks in the western part of this area. Similar rocks in the Ren-
nton quadrangle were regarded by Mullineaux (1965a) as
the Lincoln( Formation of 'Veaver (1912, p. 10-22). Thus, within about 16 miles, these rocks grade from tuff-breccia and flow rocks near the Cascade Range into volcanic sandstone and tuff beds containing fossil plant remains, and then into marine sedimentary rocks composed almost entirely of detritus from the volcanic center.
Fossil plant remains were collected from several loealities in the unnamed volcanic rocks, both in t.he mapped area and in adjacent areas (""'"olfe, 1!.>61). The flora from locality !)681, next to the Walker Lake road~ occurs in the part of the Puget Group that lies aLove a tongue of unnamed volcanic rocks. This part contains a flora assigned to the early l(ummerian Stage of earliest Oligocene age. The flora from volcanic rocks at localities !)689 and 9690 in the southwest corner of he Cumberland quadrangle and that at 9693 on the Green River, half a mile east of the Cumberland quadrangle, are assigned to the late l(ummerian Stage of early Oligocene age. Elsewhere this same flora occurs in beds of the Renton
Formation of the Puget Group (USGS palebotany loc. 9730) at Cedar Mountain and at locality 9688, 1% miles north of the Maple Valley quadrangle west of Issaquah.
Therefore, the fossil evidence suggests that the lower part of the unnamed volcanic rocks in the Green River

area is nearly equivalent in age to the Renton Formation a few miles to the north, as noted by Wolfe (1961, p. C229). The upper age limit for the unnamed volcanic rocks as mapped in this area is unknown.
Ba~ed on stratigraphic position and age, the unnamed volcanic rocks are at least in part equivalent to the Ohanapecosh Formation of the Mount Rainier area (Fiske and others, 1963; 'Vaters, 1961) and the Lincoln Formation of 'Veaver (1912, p. 10-22) in the CentraliaChehalis area of southwest 'Vashington (Snavely and others, 1958, p. 35-53). Possibly the upper part of the unnamed volmtnic rocks is also correlative with the Stevens Ridge and Fifes Peak Formations of the Mount Rainier area (Fiske and others, 1963; 'Vaters, 1961).
UPPER TERTIARY SEDIMENTARY DEPOSITS
Partly consolidated sedimentary deposits are exposed in several small outcrops in and adjacent to the Green River in two areas in the Cumberland quadrangle. One area is west of 1\:anaskat, and the other, southeast of Palmer. These flat-lying to gently dipping beds unconformably overlie the Puget Group and are unconformably overlain by glacial outwash. Glover (1941, p. 150) included the deposits east of Palmer in the Hammer Bluff Formation, a sequence of gently dipping sedimentary deposits that he named (Glover, 1936) for its occurrence at Hammer Bluff, about 8 miles southwest of the Palmer locality. Both deposits were derived chiefly from rocks 'in the Puget Group, bt1t they were probably never coextensive.
The sedimentary deposits southeast of PaJmer, which crop out on the ·south side of the Green River in the NW% sec. 14, T. 21 N., R. 7 E., are about 20 feet thick where exposed in cuts along the Northe.rn Pacific Railway, but they were deposited on an irregular surface and may be thicker elsewhere. They are composed of locally derived gravel, sand, silt, and sandy clay. A
woody lignite bed about llh feet thick occurs in the
npper pa.t,t. The. gravel is componsed of angular to subangular cobbles and pebbles of friable to semifriable n.rkosic and feldspathic sandstone. The sand beds are poorly sorted and grade into sandy clay beds. Sand and clay beds are yellowish gray to light olive gray and locally contain abundant carbonaceous fragments. The clay becomes plastic when wet and was once mined on a small scale to be used for baked clay products.
The sedimentary deposits west of l{anaskat in the SV\T1,4NE% sec. 10, T. 21 N., R. 7 E., are about 25 feet thick and are mostly breccia m1d gravel almost entirely composed of mafic igneous rocks. A bed 4 feet thick of friable fine to medium sand occurs in the lower part of the unit. These deposits rest on the irregular sur-
::148-201 0-69-H

face of a porphyritic andesite intrusive and the steeply dipping sandstone beds of the Puget Group. Many rock fragments in the breccia and the gr.avel seem to have been locally derived from the underlying intrusive.
Glover (1941, p. 150) and Warren, Norbisrath, Grivetti, and Brown (1945) included the deposits southeast of Palmer in the Hammer Bluff Formation and considered them to be of Pliocene or Pleistocene age. More recent work by Mullineaux, Gard, and Crandell (1959, p. 693), however, il,ldicated a probable late Miocene age for the Hammer Bluff Formation at its type locality. Because the deposits near Palmer and I\:anaskat occupy the same stratigraphic position as the Hammer Bluff Formation, they were tentatively assigned a late Miocene ( ~) age by Gower and Wm1ek (1963).
QUATERNARY DEPOS1ITS
Quaternary deposits blanket most of the three quadrangles mapped. The Pleistocene deposits were derived from material transported by continental glaciers from the north and by outwash streams carrying melt water from both the retreating continental ice sheets and the Cascade glaciers to the east. Crandell, Mullineaux, and 'Valdron (1958) recognized four drift sheets in the Puget Sound lowland, but only the last-the Vashon Drift-is widely exposed in the mapped area. Pre-Vashon drift is exposed locally along the Cedar River valley west of Landsburg, but no attempt was made to map this older drift in the field. The pre-Vashon deposits shown on the geologic map (pl. 1) are sketched from notes and observations by D. R. Mullineaux (oral commun., 1961), who studied these deposits in connection with regional studies of the Pleistocene and detailed mapping in the adjacei1t quadrangles to the west.
VASHON DRIFT
"Tillis (1898b, p. 111) gave the name Vashon Drift to deposits laid down on Vashon Island in Puget Sound by the last continental ice sheet that occupied the entire Puget Sound lowland. This ice sheet, like those that preceded it, was confined between the Olympic Mountains on the west and the Cascade Range on the east as the ice advanced southward :to a position about halfway between Olympia and Centralia (Bretz, 1913, p. 22). The ice was thick enough to override all but the highest peak of Tiger Mountain, whose northen1 slopes are thickly mantled with drift. Where not differentiated, these latest glacial deposits are mapped as glacial drift. Locally, the Vashon Drift is subdivided into ground moraine (till), deposits of silt and sand, and terrace gravel and stratified drift.

30 GEOLOGY AND COAL RESOURCES, CUMBERLAND, HOBART, MAPLE VALLEY QUADRANGLES, WASHINGTON

TILL
Till, in the form of ground moraine, was deposited over nearly the entire ar.ea during the advance of the ice. Till is ~videly exposed, especially in the lowland area of the Maple Valley quadrangle, where it consists of as much as 50 feet of a compact mixture of cobbles, sand, and clay. There, the drift plain is mantled by till which has formed distinctive drumlinlike parallel ridges and depressions and low, rounded hills that are elongated in the direction of the ice advance. Because the till is relatively compact and impermeable, the ground moraine is poorly drained, and many areas of undrained depressions on this surface contain lakes, swamps, and peat bogs. In many such areas the till is overlain locally by a veneer of stratified drift, lake, and swamp deposits. However, south of the Cedar River, the ground mor:aine in the lowland areas is almost completely obscured by younger deposits of stratified drift, but till is preserved on the hills, such as those near Black Diamond and Ravensdale, where it forms a mantle that conforms closely to the shape of the preglacial topography.
Compact till also forms a mantle 5-15 feet thick over the bedrock in most of the upland areas, especially on the north slopes in the Tiger Mountain and Taylor Mountain areas. Although Tiger Mountain is relatively free of drift above an altitude of about 2,700 feet, nearly all the other peaks in the area, including Squak Mountain, 'Vest Tiger Monntain, South Tiger Mountain, Taylor Mountain, and the unnamed 2,607-foot peak about a mile west of Tiger Mountain, are covered by a thick mantle of till. Slopes along the canyon of Issaquah Creek between Squa.k Mountain and 'Vest Tiger Mountain are relatively free of drift, which indicates that the advancing ice tended to scour the sides of the canyon. Drift was found at a depth below sea level in underground workings adjacent to this canyon and suggests that the advancing ice cut deeply into the canyon and that the canyon was subsequently filled to a depth of about 150 feet. A rather large quantity of till was deposited in the saddle between Tiger Mountain and "Test Tiger Mountain and "·as spread over the hummocky slopes to the south, including South Tiger Mountain. The west face of Tiger Mountain was probably scoured by the ice that moved through the saddle. Till on the crest of Taylor Mountain includes boulders of sandstone with marine fossils that could only have come from the Raging River Formation in the valley of the Raging River, to the north.

SAND AND SILT
A deposit of horizontaJly laminated, but massive weathering fine sand and silt of prin~ipally lacustrine origin lies on the Vashon Drift in the Issaquah Creek area. It extends south from the canyon of Issaquah Creek to the vicinity of Hobart. 'Vest of Hobart the deposit is found as far as Francis Lake, where medium to coa1'Se fluvial sand is interstratified with the fine sand and silt. These deposits probably accumulated in or along a lake formed when drainage to the north and west was blocked by ice during the recession of the Vashon ice sheet. Eventually, an outlet for the lake was established along the south side of Squak Mountain, but when the ice block in the canyon of Issaquah Creek melted, the lake drained north through the canyon.
TERRACE GRAVEL AND STRATIFIED DRIFT
The repeated advance and recession of the continenta.l ice sheet in the Puget Sound lowland disrupted the preglacial pattern of streams that flowed westward from the Cascade Range. In general, streams were displaeed southward during the periods of maximum glacial advance. The latest changes are well illustrated by the gravel deposits and abandoned stream channels that are readily recognizable on topographic maps of the region. The diversion of various tributaries of the Snoqualmie River when its lower valley was blocked by the continental ice sheet was thoroughly discussed by Mackin (1941). He showed that the mountain valleys of the Middle and South Forks of the Snoqualmie River and the Cedar River were all blocked by the advancing continental ice at a time when the Cascn,de glaciers were retreating. At the maximum stand of the ice, 1norainal embankments were built up; the· upper valleys were partly filled by deltaic sediment; and lakes were formed tha.t. extended well back into the Cascade Range. He also showed how the combined discharge from these lakes and melt "·ater from the continental ice sheet and the Cascade glaciers found n. new outlet to the southwest through the Cedar spillway and the modern Cedar Valley, whose lower course is the ancestral valley of the Green River. The Green River was also diverted to the south, as described by Campbell n.nd others (1915, p. 186-187). Discharge from the Cedar spillway backed up in the old channel of the Green River and flowed down a smaller valley, which is the present valley of the Green River. The lo\ver course of the smaller valley was also blocked at the mountain front, so that the combined flow from lakes, the Green River, and

Continued retreat of the ice across the gentle northwest slope of the preglacial lowland caused the Cedar and Green Rivers to occupy successively lower positions marginal to the toe of the glacier until the rivers had spread a mantle of outwash gravel across the broad lowland areas of the Cumberland quadrangle and the southern parts of the Hobart and Maple VaHey quadrangles. Finally, the Green River entrenched the valley west of Cumberland and eventuaUy cut a gorge into bedrock as much as 200 feet below the level of the outwash gravels. The Cedar River occupied a temporary channel through the lowland where the towns of Georgetown and Ravensdale are now situated. Later, it shifted to the northwest. but continued farther to join the Green River west of Black Diamond. For a while the Cedar R.iver flowed southwest from the site of Maple Valley and joined the Green River about 8 miles west of the l\{able Valley quadrangle. Eventually, the Cedar River
flowed to the north, past the site of Maple Valley; but the present course was not established until after the river had flowed for a time northeast of Cedar Grove
into the Issaquah valley and then northwest along the south side of Squak l\iountain. The Issaquah Creek

Recent soil creep, talus, and colluvial deposits are rather common on many of the steeper slopes in the area, but. outcrops are generally too poor to· allow Jnapping of most such deposits separately. However, three large landslides, recognized by breakaway scarps, slump blocks, distorted bedding, and hummocky topography were mapped and are described.
A landslide on the south side of the Green River, about 2-3 miles south of Black Diamond, has formed in glacial drift and deeply weathered unnamed volcanic rocks along the axis of the l{ummer syncline. Continued 1novement on this slide in recent years is indicated by repeated breaks in the highway where it crosses the slide. The main scarp of this slide is formed in the unnamed volcanic rocks, and the toe has been eroded away by the Green River. The position of this slide along the axis of the J(ummer syncline may indicate that it is structurally contro11ed.
A landslide at the west end of Taylor Mountain is composed of glacial drift and underlying bedrock from the Tukwila Formation. Although movement within the bedrock is chiefly parallel to the strike, the hummocky topography and fan-shaped toe suggest that the slide moves as a slow earthflow.
On the south side of Taylor Mountain, near Brew Hill, a landslide is composed of glacial drift and rocks of the Tukwila Formation. Although its shape ~annot ·

PEAT AND SWAMP DEPOSITS

ALLUVIUM

Peat and swamp deposits are scattered throughout the drift ·plain. These deposits occur adjacent to present lakes of glacial origin or mark the sites of former glacial lakes. Some lakes, such as Otter Lake and Shadow Lake in the ''"estern part of the Maple :Valley quadrangle, formed in depressions in the ground moraine and are probably underlain by till; other lakes, including Walsh Lake, Retreat Lake, and Walker Lake, probably formed in kettle holes in stratified drift and may be underlain by porous gravel. Vegetation has filled the shallow margins of many of these lakes, and elsewhere peat bogs fill depressions that formerly contained lakes. Rigg (1958, p. 69-95) studied the peat deposits in this area and found chiefly sedimentary and fibrous varieties of peat mixed with local concentrations of sphagnum, woody peat, and inorganic detritus. Most of the peat and swamp deposits shown on the geologic map (pl. 1) are at least 4 feet thick, and some are locally much thicker. Peat and organic soil deposits, including many that are less than 4 feet thick, are further classified on the soil map of King County by Poulson, Miller,
Fowler, and Flannery (1952). Peat is locally used as a soil conditioner.

Holocene alluvium consisting of gravel and sand was mapped along the modern flood plain of the Cedar River, especially below Landsburg, and locally on the Green River, as near Kanaskat and Palmer Junction. Alluvium was also mapped along Issaquah Creek and Coal Greek. These deposits are similar in most respects to the older terrace gravels, but they are closer to the modern stream profile and have undergone relatively little erosion. The alluvium deposits are nearly flat and include humus in the soil profile; they are commonly utilized for grazing land and dwellings and are subject to the potential hazard of flooding.
INTRUSIVE IGNEOUS ROCKS
Igneous rocks intrude the Raging River Formation and the Puget Group at many places in the Cumberland, Hobart, and Maple Valley quadrangles. Locally, the unnamed volcanic rocks are also intruded. Most of the intrusions are sills or sill-like bodies less than 40 feet thick. A few are as much as 150 feet thick, and one on Fifteenmile Creek is about 400 feet thick. The intrusive rocks commonly form massive outcrops or steep slopes because they are more resistant to weathering

and erosion than the enclosing sedimentary rocks. All have a porphyritic texture and are generally medium dark gray to dark greenish gray. Most are probably calqic andesites, though some may be basaltic and others dacitic in composition. Phenocrysts of plagioclase feldspar 2-4 mm long commonly m·ake up 5-20 percent of the rock; augite phenocrysts locally make up as much as 10 percent. Most of the phenocrysts are euhedral to subhedral, and many are zoned. The groundmass is generally composed of fine to very fine laths of plagioc.Iase feldspar, pyroxene (augite~), chlorite, clay minerals, and magnetite. Secondary calcite occurs in the groundmass and as a replacement of plagioclase phenocrysts. The feldspar, both in the groundmass and as phenocrysts, is chiefly andesine, and most is somewhat altered. A sill, about 100 feet thick, which may be fairly representative of these intrusive bodies, occurs in sec. 26, T. 21 N., R. 7 E. Table 6 gives the chemical composition of this sill.
The 400-foot sill on Fifteenmile Creek is exposed on n prominent unnamed hill in tlw NEl~ sec. 13, T. 23 N., R. 6 E., and adjacent sections. It is medium-dark-gray porphyritic rock composed of about 15 percent plagioclase phenocrysts and 85 percent groundmass. The phenocrysts average about 1 by 3 mm ; the groundmass consists mainly of smaller plagioclase blades that avernge about 0.5 by 1 mni and a less abundant mafic mineral, probably augite, as well as calcite, chlorite, and opaque minerals. Adjacent to the overlying sandstone the intrusion is highly altered, and calcite forms as much a.s 30 percent of the rock. A smaller sill occurs in the NW:% sec. 13 but probably is related to the main mass. It is nearly holocrystalline and contains fewer large phenocrysts. It consists of about 50 percent plagioclase with a composition of about An45, 30 percent augite ( ~), and 20 percent fine-grained groundmass, which includes calcite and other alteration products plus opaque min-

erals. The intrusive rocks exposed on nearby hills as far south as South Tiger Mountain in sec. 30, T. 23 N., R. 7 E., are probably related to the intrusion at Fifteenmile Creek. They differ chiefly by being finer grainerl and by having more chloritic alteration. A porphyritic intrusive rock is exposed about 1% miles west of the main mass at Fifteenmile Creek near the center of the Slh sec. 14, T. 23 N., R. 6 E. This sill is overlain by the unnamed volcanic rocks and is assumed to cut these rocks, although the contact is covered. The sill is similar in most respects to the main mass at Fifteenmile Creek, but is considerably altered and contains green chalcedony, native copper, and an isotropic zeolite among alteration products.
East of Lake Desire a medium-dark-gray to darkgray porphyritic intrusive rock crops out on the hilltops in NWlJt sec. 31, T. 23 N., R. 6 E. The contact of this intrusion with the sedimentary rocks is not exposed, but the intrusion is probably a sill. The rock contains about 60 percent plagioclase phenocrysts 0.5-10 mm long; 20 percent mafic mineral, probably augite; and 20 percent groundmass, including fine-grained plagioclase, chlorite, and opaque minerals. Another porphyritic intrusive rock crops out along the axis of Sherwood anticline on 'Vebster Creek in the NElJtSE'l~ sec. 4, T. 22 N., R. 7 E. It is medium dark gray and similar in texture and general appearance to those previously described but has been intensely altered. The plagioclase grains are extremely clouded, and chlorite and opaque minerals are abundant.
An intrusive rock in the canyon of Issaquah Creek is distinctively different from most in the area and was mapped separately (porphyritic intrusive, pl. 1). It is a greenish-gray porphyritic hornblende andesite or dacite and is exposed chiefly in the canyon walls in sec. 10, T. 23 N., R. 6 E. This intrusive body apparently cuts across beds of the Tukwila Format.ion, is lenticular in shape, and may be a small stock. Inasmuch as the rock resembles fragments in the conglomerate and tuffbreccia in the upper part of the Tukwila Formation, it possibly represents a vent of a volcano that supplied extrusive material. The rock is composed of phenocrysts of zoned and altered plagioclase and hornblende as much as 5 mm long in a fine-grained groundmass. Subhedral plagioclase phenocrysts (fig. 14) make up about 40 percent of the rock. In thin section the plagio-
nclase is seen to be clouded, strained, and partly replaced
by zeolite( along clea.vage planes. On an X-ray diffractometer pattern of the plagioclase, the specific peaks, used in the method of Smith and Yoder (1956), are broad, and their spacing indicates a probable range in composition from about An2~; to An 3;;. Euhedral horn-

quartz and pyrite in addition to the calcite and chlorite. In some of the more intensely altered rocks, the original igneous texture is almost completely obscured; the rock is a hornfels and is almost impossible to distinguish in the field from rocks of sedimentary origin. Intensely altered sills are also associated with some of the coal beds at Sugarloaf Mountain, but they are not shown on the geologic map. They are discussed in the section "Hydrothermally Altered Rocks."
Probably the igneous rocks in the area represent more than one age of intrusion. The hornblende andesite intrusion in the canyon of Issaquah Creek is apparently associated with and about the same age as the hornblende-bearing volcanic rocks of the Tukwila Formation-that is, Eocene. The dark augite-bearing rocks, which probably include all other sills, are similar in composition to the unnamed volcanic rocks. These dark augite-bearing rocks are probably genetically related to the younger volcanic rocks and are tentatively assigned an Oligocene age, though they may be younger.

FIGU RE H.- Porphyritic hornblende andesite from an intrusive body exposed in the canyon of Issaquah Creek. The euhedral zoned plagioclase phenocrysts ( P) are clouded, s trained, and partly replaced by zeolite. Hornblende (H) occurs as euhedral crystals, and many have been replaced by chlorite.
blende phenocrysts, composing 5 percent of the rock, appear to be decomposed and chloritized when viewed in thin section. The grou.ndmass is so altered and clouded that its composition was not determined, but opaque minerals probably make up 1-2 percent of the rock. An X-ray diffractometer analysis of the whole rock indicates that quartz is a major constituent, but individual grains are sparse. Probably much of the clouded appearance of the groundmass is due to a microscopic intergrowth of quartz, plagioclase, and chlorite.
The igneous sills that intrude the lower part of the Raging River Formation in sees. 9, 10, and 15, T. 23 N., R. 7 E., are dark gray to light gray, depending on the degree of alteration. In the dark-gray sills some of the mafic minerals and groundmass are partly replaced by calcite and chlorite. Where light gray the sills are generally more intensely altered and contain

HYDROTHERMALLY ALTERED ROCKS
In the northern part of the Hobart quadrangle, some of the sedimentary and volcanic rocks have been so completely altered by hydrothermal solutions that the characteristics of the original rock are indeterminable. These rocks are composed of clay, quartz, and iron oxide minerals and were mapped separately as hydrothermally altered rocks (pl. 1) in three areas between the north peak of South Tiger Mountain and the north boundary of the Hobart quadrangle. The rocks consist chiefly of microcrystalline silica intergrown with clay (generally kaolinite) and impregnated with limonitic and hematitic iron. The iron oxides cement the quartz and clay along a network of intersecting veinlets. Between the ninlets, the rock is white to shades of red, yellow, and bro"·n. Concentric bands of color are common. The dip of the strata is usually obliterated, and outcrops are commonly brecciated. A broad transition zone generally occurs between hydrothermally altered rock and unaltered rock.
\Vhere rocks of different compositions lie next to each other, hydrothermal alteration was locally very selective. An example of this can be seen on the south slope of Tiger Mountain, where molds and casts of marine mollusks in the Raging River Formation are well preserved in -a moderate-red fine-grained rock that is other>Yise highly altered. Seemingly fresh unaltered sandstone and siltstone of the Tiger Mountain Formation lie directly above the altered rock in the Raging River Formation; west of the unaltered Tiger Mountain rocks, the

STRATIGRAPHY

. strata are completely altered to siliceous, argillaceous, and ferric minerals. The clay matrix of the sandstone beds in the Tiger Mountain Formation contains kaolinite rather than montmorillonite or chlorite, whieh are common elsewhere; thus, the effects of hydrothermal alteration may be present although not megascopically apparei}t. The Tukwila Formation in the Tiger Mountain area has been altered to an unusually fine textured yellow to brownish-gray rock that resembles porcellanite. Fossil leaf impressions are locally well preserved in the porcellanitelike rock, but stratification and minor lithologic differences are obscure.
Another example of selective alteration is seen in the excellent exposure in the SW!4SE!4 sec. 34, T. 22 N., R. 7 E., where an altered sill intrudes the Big Elk coal bed. The sill, 5-8 feet thick, generally follows the bedding of the coal but locally cuts across the bedding (fig. 15). It is very light gray to yellowish gray and has been completely altered to a mass of kaolinite, quartz, brown veinlets of limonite, dispersed crystal pods of calcite, and radiating fibrous crystal aggregates of dawsonite. (Dawsonite was identified by A. J. Gude,

3d, written commun., 1963). The original crystal texture of the sill has been obliterated. The coal, on the other hand, is fresh and unaltered, except in a zone 1-3 inches thick bordering the sill where the coal is altered to ash and coke. Baking of the coal next to the sill probably resulted in production of volatile organic compounds that reacted chemically with the sill and caused its alteration before it could crystallize. The ·altered igneous intrusion in the Taylor coal field that was mined as a s_ource of clay (Glover, 1941, p. 122) was probably similar to the sill at the Bik Elk coal bed.
Igneous-rock alteration similar to that a,t Sugarloaf Mountain was observed on a prominent high ridge a short distance east of the axis of the Taylor syncline, near the center of sec. 3, T . 22 N., R. 7 E. This may be the "intrusive dike" mentioned by Evans (1912, p. 136138) which closely follows the No. 1 coal bed and at times seems to have destroyed the coal. Evans (1912, p . 141) stated:
Some of the intrusive dikes and sills have decomposed in place, and the resulting material is used extensively in the factory for manufacturing various wares.

36 GEOLOGY AND COAL RESOURCES, CUMBERLAND, HOBART, MAPLE VALLEY QUADRANGLES, WASHINGTON

The dikes and sills are further described by Glover (1941, p.122), who stated:
A 22-foot . rhyolite sill, completely altered, was formerly mined on the- west side of the syncline. This clay was called "Taylor White," and was mined from two drifts for 2,600 feet on one level and for 6,800 feet on a lower level. A large amount of this clay probably still lies along the strike of the sill, so that a demand for material.to be used with ball clay for common whiteware could be met.
In describing a sample of the altered rock,- Glover continued:
Kaolinization has not progressed to the colloidal, unctuous state found in some. of the. eastern 'Vashington residual clays, and so the materialis mealy, crumbles easily, and is very hard feeling. It is composed of partly altered feldspar, quartz, some white mica, and a small amount of calcite. Extensive leaching has removed the fernie minerals and their alteration products. Some samples are so homogeneous that component minerals are recognized with difficulty.
STRUCTURE
Although the major physiographic regions of western Washington-the Olympic Mountains, the Puget Sound lowland, and the Cascade Range-are distinctive and easily recognized (Fenneman, 1931, p. 422-458), the regional structure is somewhat obscure. The Olympic Mountains on the west represent the structurally high Olympic uplift (Cohee, 1961) in which pre-Tertiary(~) rocks are flanked on the north, east, and south by a thick sequence of Tertiary volcanic and sedimentary rocks. The Puget Sound lowland is a region of folded Tertiary rocks overlain by P.leistoeene drift that was labelled the Puget downwarp by Cohee (1961). Ho,vever, such a classification depends upon the part of the adjacent mountain areas with which it is compared. The northern section of the Cascade Range consists of northwest-trending pre-Cenozoic metamorphic rocks and Cenozoic plutonic rocks (Huntting and others, 1961). A few miles south of U.S. Highway 10, across Snoqualmie Pass, the Cascade Range ~onsists chiefly of a thick pile of folded Cenozoic volcanic rocks and small areas of Cenozoic sedimentary and plutonic rocks. The area descri·bed in this report is adjacent to rthe western margin of the Cascade Range, opposite the zone in which the character of the range changes (fig. 16).
The Puget Sound lowland includes three gravity lows alined along a nort.h-south trend, the middle one of which centers near Seattle· (fig. 16). An area of higher gravity lies southwest of Seattle between the middle and southernmost gravity lows, approximately .due west of the area of this report. The gravity contours in this area trend in a west-northwest direction and correspond, in general, to the trend of the upland area which extends west from Tiger Mountain to the Newcastle Hills.

Weaver (1916, p. 150-108) described the structure of the upland area and referred to it as the Newcastle Hills anticline. He speculated that the south side may be bounded by a fault, a possibility that seems to be strengthened by the northwest dip which is visible in a rock quarry in the Tukwila Formation on Squak MouJ}tain, about half a mile north of the Maple· Valley quadrangle. The trends of the gravity contours and the speculative fault correspond in a general way to the trend of the hinge line that separates the two areas of different subsidence rates. North of this hinge line rocks of middle and late Eocene age may he more than twice as thick as to the south. When projected east-southeast, the hinge line seems to correspond approximately to the boundary between the northern and southern parts of the Cascade Range. If these speculations are meaning-

Small folds and faults are common in the Cumberland, Hobart, and Maple Valley quadrangles and tend to obscure the regional pattern as outlined above. The rocks are deformed into a series of anticlinal and ~yn­ clinal folds whose flanks generally dip 30°-60° and are locally vertical to overturned. The map distance between the axes of adjacent anticlines and synclines gen-

The northeast flank of the syncline is relatively gentle and can be mapped continously across Taylor Mountain, as shown by the trace· of the sandstone marker beds in the Tukwila Form:ation; the soutlnvest flank is steep and is locally overturned. About half a mile southwest of the axial trace of the Taylor syncline is the axial trace of the Sherwood anticline, exposed in the banks of Webster Creek. The approximate position of both the Taylor syncline and the Sherwood anticline can be identified nearly 2 miles northwest of Taylor by the strike and dip of beds in the Tukwila Formation.
Tiger Moun.tain area.-A synclinal struoture on the south side of Tiger ~fountain plunges to the southwest
and may be a continuation of the Taylor syncline. An
anticlinal a.xis about half a mile to the west, near the
crest of Tiger Mountain, may be a northward contin-
uation of the Sherwood anticline, although the axial
trace was mapped for only a few thousand feet. The
Tiger Mountain fault is inferred to be west of the crest
of Tiger Mountain in order to account for .the apparent

town the strata are steeply dipping to overturned toward the northwest. None of the coal beds have been traced north of the Cedar River. The beds in the single outcrop of unnamed volcanic rocks exposed .along the

have a northwest strike and a northeast dip, suggesting that a large syncline may lie north of the river.
Sugarloaf 'AIountain a1'ea.-The folds in the Sugarloaf Mountain ·area northwest of J(anaskat trend generally northwest and are broken by several faults which also trend north or northwest, but neither folds nor faults can be traced into adjacent areas.
Du·rham a1··ea.-The upland east of Sugarloaf Mountain, in the Durham area, forms the west margin of the Cascade Range, where the rocks in the Puget Group are last exposed before dipping beneath the unnamed volcanic rocks to the east. Overturned strata near Durham are probably in limbs of drag folds on the east side of a reverse fault which strikes north and dips east. South of Durham the Green River fault is inferred to explain an apparent right-lateral offset of the contact across the canyon between the Puget Group and the overlying unnamed volcanic rocks about 1 mile east of the Cumberland quadrangle. If the movement on this fanlt. has been horizontal, the south side has moved nearly 3,000 feet to the west. If the movement has been vertical, the south side has been downdropped about 1,400 feet. The northwestward continuation of the Green River fault is uncertain, but this fault may be continuous with the large fault at Georgetown. If the movement has been horizontal, the thick section of overturned Puget near Landsburg may have resulted from drag along the south side of the fault.
OWJnberland-Bayne area.-A series of rather small asymmetric 'folds plunges southward east of the Lawson anticline and south of the Green River. Many of these folds are broken by northwest-trending faults on which the exact displacements are not known. The apparent large latern,l offset of the contact along the northwesttrending fault west of Walker Lake may be real, or it may in part reflect a miscorrelation of beds on opposite sides of the fault. As mapped, this fault has an apparent throw of about 750 feet.
Although ultimately related to such regional tectonic features as the Olympic uplift, the Puget downwarp, and the Cascade Range, individual structural features in the Cumberland, Hobart, and Maple Valley quadrangles present a rather bewildering structure pattern. This is partly because extensive QuUJternary deposits conceal many critical areas and also because the folding is superimposed on a complexly interstratified sequence of volcanic and sedimentary rocks. Although the

local offsetting of folds by faults suggests that the faults are younger, both features probably developed during one major period of orogeny, during which both Eocene and younger rocks were deformed. The age of this orogeny can be bracketed from evidence in adjacent areas. Warren, Norbisrath, Grivetti, and Brown (1945) followed C. E. Weaver in assigning an early Miocene age to the upper part of the marine rocks exposed in a roadcut of U.S. I-Iighway 10 in sec. 13, T. 24 N., R. 5 E., near the south end of Sammamish La.ke. These marine rocks dip northward and are apparently parallel with the underlying Puget Group rocks; so· it may be assumed that these marine rocks are involved in the principal folding. The gently tilted unconsolidated sediments that unconformably overlie the Puget Group ·at Hammer Bluff, along the Green River about 1112 miles west of the Cumberland quadrangle, were described by Mullineaux, Gard, and Crandell (1959) as being of probable late Miocene age. Although the ages of these deposits were not verified during the present study, they seem to indicate an early or middle Miocene age for the major folding in the area.
ECONOMIC GEOLOGY
CLAY DEPOSITS
A variety of rocks from this area, ranging from altered igneous rock to glacial clay, have been used in the manufacture of different kinds of brick, sewer pipe, and refractory ware. The largest sources of elay are the Renton Formation and .the upper part of the undifferentiated Puget Group. A few miles west and northwest of the mapped area, at Renton and Newcastle, International Pipe & Ceramics Corp. and Builders' Brick Co. were operating plants in 1962, utilizing source materials from the Renton Formation. The fine-grained rocks in the Renton Formation commonly contain kaolinite as the principal clay mineral; the older rocks in the Puget Group contain a variety of other clay minerals, many of which are not satisfactory for the manufacture of baked clay products because of low fusion temperatures, undesirable swelling characteristics, poor color, or other properties.
Many of the commercial clay deposits in this area are described in a comprehensive report by Glover (1941). Much additional information on high-alumina clay deposits is available in a report by Nichols (1946). Table 7 presents a summa.ry of information on .the clay deposits in this and adjoining areas and includes much data obtained from these two sources. Though the report by Nichols (1946) is concerned with the poten:tial of high-alumina clay deposits as ore for metallic

40 GEOLOGY AND COAL RESOURCES, CUMBERLAND, HOBART, MAPLE VALLEY QUADRANGLES, WASHINGTON

aluminum, these same deposits may be valuable as a source of refractory clay. Kaolinite, boehmite, ·and gibb-site, which are the principal "ore" minerals, are also the principal ingredients of refractory clay. Most of these deposits also contain variable amounts of siderite grains 1-2 mm long imbedded in the clay. The siderite detracts from the value of these deposits but can be easily removed from the clay in a laboratory magnetic separator, which suggests the possibility of beneficiating the clay on a commercial scale. Nichols (1946, table 12) estimated the clay resources to be about 20 million tons.
Perhaps the most abundant and most suitable sources of clay for nonrefraotory wares are the siltstone, claystone, and carbonaceous shale that are interbedded with coal in the Puget Group, especially in the upper part. Kaolinite is a waste product of the glass-sand industry in this area. Sandstone mined in sec. 30, T. 21 N., R. 7 E., is washed to remove the silt and clay; tailings from this

process might be suitable for clay products. Another deposit of friable sandstone with a kaolinite clay matrix similar to that used for making glass occurs adjacent to an igneous sill in the Fifteenmile Creek area, NWI4 sec.13, T. 23 N., R. 6 E.
K·aolinite is one of the principal products of the hydrothermal alteration in the Tiger Mountain area, and many of the volcanic and sedimentary rocks adjacent to the mapped area of hydrothermally ·altered rock have also been kaolinized. For example, the matrix of the rocks in the Tiger Mountain Formation in the NWtt4 sec. 17, T. 23 N., R. 7 E., has a much higher proportion of kaolinite to other clay minerals than do equivalent rocks elsewhere, but the Tiger Mountain Formation does not have the altered appearance of adjacent rocks in the Raging River and Tukwila Formations. Locally, as on the north side of South Tiger Mountain, the hydrothermally altered rocks are bleache, which suggests that much of the iron and other soluble

of the clean sand are obtainable without removing overburden. Deposits of sandy stratified glacial drift are also exposed at many places along the new highway that follows the valleys of Holder Creek and Deep Creek (fig. 13) . Fine sand and silt is abundant in lacustrine deposits in the valley of Issaquah Creek near Hobart. Except for local concentrations of coarser grained sand, most of these deposits are too fine grained for commercial-grade sand.
Sand suitable for the manufacture of amber glass is mined from an open pit in the SE!JtNW1;4 Sec. 30, T. 21 N., R. 7 E., by the Smith Brothers Silica Sand Co. In 1962 the company opened a pit in a friable massive sandstone zone in the upper part of the undifferentiated Puget Group. The rock is a very light gray medium- to coarse-grained arkose comprising about two-thirds quartz, one-third potash-feldspar, and minor lithic fragments. The matrix makes up about 10 percent of the rock and is chiefly silt-size quartz grains and kaolinite.

CONSTRUCTION STONE

The nearness of the mapped area to metropolitan

Seattle makes it economical to quarry stone for a variety

of construction purposes. A good local market exists for

stone ranging from fine aggregate for use in road con-

struction to riprap for use in retaining walls, erosion-

abatement fill, and fill for dams and other engineering

works. Relatively fresh intrusive or volcanic rocks, espe-

cially lava flows and tuff-breccias, have been used for

decorative garden stone. In 1961, garden stone and

broken rock were quarried from a greenish-gray tuff-

breccia bed in the Tukwila Formation in the SE% sec. 6,

T. 23 N., R. 6 E., about half a mile north of the Maple

Valley quadrangle. The greenish-gray porphyritic horn-

blende andesite in the canyon of Issaquah Creek might

also be suitable for garden stone. Rock in other igneous

sills in the mapped area may have value as construction

stone, but its darker color may detract from its decora-

tive value. These include the massive sill near the head

of Fifteenmile Creek, the sill near Cedar Mountain, the

COAL
MINING HISTORY
Coal was first discovered and mined in King County in 1853 near the present site of Renton (Green, 1947, p. 8). This eoal was of poor quality, and only a small amount was produced for local use. Coal mining began near Issaquah in 1862 and in Newcastle the following year (Evans, 1912, p. 239). By about 1880 eoal was mined in the Cedar Mountain area, and in 1930 a peak produetion of 349,000 tons of coal was reael1ed. Between 1880 and 1944, the last year of recorded production, the Cedar Mountain area produced about 4 million tons of coal. Production in the Tiger Mountain area began in 1891 (Evans, 1912, p. 134), and from 1905 to 1940, the last year of reeorded production, about 640,000 tons of coal was mined. Production figures are not available for the years before 1905.
The first recorded mining in the Green River district was at Black Diamond in about 1883. The Green River district has produeed about 25 million tons of coalmore than half the total J(ing County production. Although most of the Green River district lies in the Cumberland quadrangle, a significant amount of this production has come from mines in the Mcl(ay coal bed directly west of the mapped area. Annual production in the Green River district reached a high of 925,000 tons in 1903. Produetion has declined almost continuously since that date, and cnrrent annual production is only about 50,000 tons.
Most of the coal produced in the area of this report has been mined underground. Both drift, or "waterlevel" and slope mines have been used. Drift mines are self-draining mines in whieh the lowest point in the mine is the portal. Many mines were started as drift mines and later, when all coal above the level of the portal had been extraeted, were eonverted to slope mines. In slope mines, gangways along the strike of the coal bed are driven off the main slope at different levels. These mines are troubled by water seepage and require continuous pumping to remove excess water. Evans (1912, p. 201-216) described in detail the methods used in specific. mines. Table 9 lists the coal mines and prospects in the report area.

During and shortly after World War II, many of the thicker coal beds in the Cumberland quadrangle were strip mined. One of the largest strip pits was on the Franklin No. 12 coal bed on the east limb of the Kummer syncline (fig. 17). Locally, the McKay coal bed south of the Ravensdale fault and several of the Ravensdale coal beds north of the fault were also strip mined. Other beds strip mined were the Cumberland, Carbon, several of the Occidental coal beds wes~ of Bayne, several beds in the Sugarloaf Mountain area, the Durham No. 1 coal bed, and the Navy Nos. 4 and 6 coal beds. In general, however, coal beds Ill King County dip steeply, and strip mining is difficult and expensive.
PHYSICAL AND CHEMICAL PROPERTIES
The coal in the Cumberland, Hobart, ·and Maple Valley quadrangles ranges In rank from subbituminous B to high-volatile A bituminous, according to the -classification established by the American Society for Testing and Materials (1966, p. 73). Most of the coal is of highvolatile B bituminous rank. Coal beds that are borderline between the subbituminous and bituminous categories are here included in the bituminous category.

Averages of analyses of the coal beds are given in table 10. The average ash content of all the coal beds analyzed is about 15 percent. The McKay coal bed has the lm,est average ash content, about 4.5 percent; and the Sunset No. 7 coal bed has the highest ash contenrt, 38.5 percent, which is unusually high. Most of the coals analyzed have less than 19 percent ash. The sulfur content is low, ranging from 0.2 to 1.9 percent in individual samples. The average for the coal beds is 0.6 to 0.7 percent sulfur. The moisture content in individual samples ranges from 2.1 to 19.2 percent and averages 8 percent. Volatile matter ranges from 26.4 to 40.3 percent and averages about 35 percent. Fixed carbon in the coal beds ranges from 30.2 to 51.4 percent and averages

tuminous in others. Generally, the higher the coal bed stratigraphically, the lower its rank. Thus, all coal beds of the Kummer coal zone in the Green River area are subbituminous, as are those in the Renton Formation except the bituminous coal in the New I.Jake Young coal bed in the Cedar Mountain area and the coal beds of the Taylor area. All coals for which analyses were not available are assumed to be of bituminous rank.

about 42 percent. ~iost of the coals analyzed have heating values of greater than 10,000 Btu, ranging from 7,990 Btu for the high-ash Sunset No. 7 coal bed to 13,230 Btu for one sample of the Mcl{ay coal bed. The average of 25 analyses of the McKay coal bed is 12,070 Btu.
CLASSIFICATION OF RESOURCES
The known resources of coal as determined by mapping and exploration in the Cumberland~ Hobart, and Maple Valley quadrangles are estimated to be about 630 million tons. Of these resources, about 22 percent, or 140 million tons, is classified as subbituminous, and 78

percent, or 490 million tons, is classified as bituminous. Resources are estimated for bituminous coal beds 14 or more inches thick ·and for subbituminous coal beds 21h or more feet thick, all within 3,000 feet of the surface. These resources are classified according to rank of coal, thickness of bed, thickness of overburden, and reliability of data. Table 11 lists the resources by individual bed and township. Only parts of some townships are present in the mapped area; therefore, the resource figures shown in table 11 do not represent the total coal resources for these townships and should not
he compared directly with the resource estimates made by Beikman, Gower, and Dana (1961).

In calculating resources, a stand-ard weight of 1,800 Evans (1912) and from Warren, Norbisrath, Grivetti, tons per acre-foot was used for bituminous coal, and one and Brown· (1945). Coal resources are also classified by of 1,770 tons per acre-foot was used for subbituminous thickness of overburden (table 11). coal. The coal-resource estimates are divided into three Estimates of coal resources are divided according to bed-thickness categories as given in table 11: thin, inter~ the abundance and reliability of the data into three mediate, and thick. All partings were excluded from the categories : measured, indicated, and inferred. Measured estimates given. At the time of this investigation, only resources are computed from dimensions of coal beds a few coal beds were well enough exposed that the revealed in outcrops, trenches, mine workings, and drill coal sections could be measured; therefore, U.S. Bureau holes.

puted partly from specific measurements and partly from the projection of data for a reasonable distance on the basic geologic evidence. In most areas the points of observation are about 1 mile apart. Because of extensive glacial cover and complex structure, most indicated resources in this report are less than half a mile from the points of observation. Inferred resources arc those based on a broad knowledge of the geologic character of individual coni beds and on an assumed continuity of the coal. In general, inferred resources in this report lie within 2 miles of the points of obsetTntion. To avoid
disclosing measured resources of coal on m1 individually
owned property, measured and indicated resources were combined.

Figure 18 shows generalized columnar sections of most of the principal coal beds in the Cumberland, Hobart, and Maple Va.Iley quadrangles. Although individual coal beds in the Ceda.r :Mountain and Taylor areas cannot be directly correlated with coal beds in the Green River area, they are probably equivalent to beds in the l(ummer coal zone and possibly the upper part of the Franklin zone.

report area. The principal beds in this coal zone are, from oldest to youngest, the Franklin Nos, 9, 10, 11, and 12, Big Dirty, Mcl{ay, Gem, and Harris coal beds. Data were sufficient to allow estimation of resources for all the above-mentioned beds except the poorly exposed Big Dirty coal bed. West of the Cumberland quadrangle, in mine "B," a coal bed that has not been recogniz~ in the Cumberland quadrangle ·was mined between the Mcl{ay and Gem coal beds (Evans, 1912). This coal bed and perhaps several others may also be present in the Franklin coal zone.
Franklin No. 9 coal bed.-The Franklin No. 9 coal bed and its possible correlative, the Old Carbon coal bed, are probably the oldest coal beds included in the resource estimates. Older beds exposed in the Green River Canyon are too impure to be classed as resources. Very little coal has been mined from .the F·ranklin No. 9 coal bed. No analyses are available for this bed, but because of its stratigraphic position the bed is assumed to be of bituminous rank. Evans' (1912, fig. 30) measurement of 5 feet 3 inches of coal was used in estimating resources for the Franklin No.9 bed. Plate 4, map A. shows the distribution of coal resources for this bed.
Frariklin No.JO coal bed.-The Franklin No. 10 coal bed has been extensively mined north of the Green River on the east limb of. the Kummer syncline. It has also been mined at two localities in the '¥1;2 sec. 8, T. 21 N., R. 7 E. Reliable measurements of the thickness of coal in this bed range from 5 feet 4 inches to 11 feet 4 inches (pl. 3, map locs. 25, 30). The distribution of coal resources for this bed is shown on plate 4, map B.
Franklin No. 11 coal bed.-The Franklin No. 11 coal bed was not observed during the course of the current fieldwork. According to Evans (1912, fig. 30, p. 163) it is 1 foot 10 inches thick. It has been mined north of the Green River in the SE% sec. 18, T. 21 N., R. 7 E. The distribution of coal resources for this bed is shown on plate 4, map 0.
Black Beauty coal bed.-The Black Beauty coal bed is between the Franklin Nos. 10 and 12 coal beds in the '¥1;2 sec. 8, T. 21 N., R. 7 E. Possibly the Black Beauty bed is equivalent to the Franklin No. 11 coal bed. The Black Beauty is reported to contain about 21j2 feet of clean coal (Ernest Seliger, oral commun., 1961), and this figure is used in the resources estimate. The dist.ribution of these resources is shown on plate 4, map D.
Franklin No.1~ coal bed.-The Franklin No. 12 coal bed, also called the Fulton coal bed, is a 40-foot-thick zone of coal, impure coal, and partings. Only part of
this bed is now exposed. '""arren, Norbisrath, Grivetti, and Brown's (1945) measurement of 7 feet 5 inches of clean cO'al in an outcrop along the Green River was

used in calculating the resource estimates of this bed (pl. 3, map Joe. 78). The Franklin No. 12 bed was only partly exposed and probably contains additional coal of adequate quality to appreciably increase its resources. This bed has been extensively mined underground east of the axis of the Kummer syncline, both north and south of the Green River, and has been extensively strip mined along its outcrops on the east limb of the J{ummer syncline north of the Green River. The distribution of resources of the Franklin No. 12 coal bed is shown on plate 4, map E.
McKay coal bed.-In the report area the McKay coal bed has been the coal bed most extensively mined, owing to its low ash content and high heating value (table 9). The McKay coal bed consists of an upper bench that ranges in thickness from 2 feet to 8 feet 11;2 inches and a lower bench 4-6 feet ·thick (pl. 3, map locs. 39, 50, 64). South of the Green River in the SWll.t, sec. 29, T. 21 N., R. 7 E., the bed apparently thins to less than 31;2 feet (pl. 3, map loc. 44); it has been recognized to extend from Deep Lake on the south to the Ravensdale. fault on the north. The coal bed exposed in a strip pit on the east limb of a north-plunging anticline directly south of the Ravensdale fault in the SE% sec. 36, T. 22 N., R. 6 E., is tentatively assigned to the McKay bed for purposes of calculating resources (pl. 3, map loc. 80). This assignment is questionable, however, for fossil leaves collected above this bed (USGS paleobotany loc. 9732) are assigned to the late Fultonian Stage; the coal bed occurs between the Franklin No. 12 and Big Dirty coal beds in the Green River section. Plate 4, map F, shows the distribution of resources of the Mcl{ay coal bed.
Gem coal bed.-The Gem coal bed ranges in thickness from 3 feet 10 inches south of the Franklin fault to 2 feet 4% inches in the Nlj2 sec. 18, T. 21 N., R. 7 E., north of the fault. This bed has been extensively mined on the east limb of the Kummer syncline on both sides of the Franklin fault. Plate 4, map D, shows the distribution of coal resources for the Gem bed. Plate 3 shows a graphic sec~ion of this bed (map loc. 24).
Harris coal bed.-The Harris coal bed was not observed during the course of the current work. According to Evans (1912, fig. 32, p. 167), this coal bed is 2 feet 3 inches thick. The Harris coal bed has been mined in sees. 18 and 19, T. 21 N., R. 7 E. The distribution of resources for this bed is shown on plate 4, map G.
Kum1ner coal beds.-Data were sufficient to estimate resources for only four coal beds in the J{ummer coal zone-the J{ummer Nos. 0, 1, and 4 and an unnamed bed exposed on the south side of the Green River in the NE% sec. 25, T. 21 N., R. 6 E. Additional da.ta on thick-

34, T. 22 N., R. 7 E. The Cashman coal bed (Victory, or Bed A) is 9 feet 1 inch thick (pl. 3, map loc. 20). Fossil leaves collected from the Cashman horizon (USGS paleobotany loc. 9731) were assigned by Wolfe (1968) to the late Ravenian Stage which occupies the interval between the McKay coal bed and the Kummer sandstone of Evans (1912, p. 46) in the Franklin coal zone.
Mc/ntyre coal bed.-The previously unnamed bed of the Mcintyre prospect north of Sugarloaf Mountain in the NW14SE:JU sec. 28, T. 22 N., R. 7 E. (U.S. Bureau Mines, 1931, p. 128), is here called the Mcintyre coal bed. This bed contains 4 feet 5 inches of coal (pl. 3, map loc. 38). Plate 4, map J~ shows the distribution of resources of this bed.
Alta coal bed.-The Alta: coal bed, or Big Seam, is the bed mined in the Alta and K·angley mines east of the Cumberland quadrangle in sees. 28·and 35, T. 22 N., R. 7 E. This bed is 51;'2 feet thick. Plate 4, map F, shows the distribution of resources of this bed.
Beds in lliattvatha tunnel.-The Hiawatha tunnel, an east-west tunnel perpendicular to the strike of the beds in the S1h sec. 35, T. 22 N., R. 7 E., cuts several coal beds. Resources are estimated for three beds cut by this tunnel: the Lower Mammoth, the Upper Mammoth, and the Soft Coal beds. The thicknesses used in these resource calculations are from unpublished mine maps. Of the three beds, only the Upper Mammoth was mined in the area of this report. Analyses are not available for any of these beds, but the beds are here assumed to be of bituminous rank. The distribution of resources for the Lower Mammoth, Upper Mammoth, and Soft Coal beds is shown on plate 4, maps E, L, and G, respectively.

Palmer coal beds.-The Palmer A and Palmer B coal beds crop out in roadcuts on the west limb of a southplunging syncline east of Palmer. The Palmer A coal bed crops out in the NW:JUNW:JU sec. 14, T. 21 N., R. 7 E.; the Palmer B coal bed crops out in the NE:JUNE14 sec. 15, T. 21 N., R. 7 E. The Palmer A coal bed is 2 feet 5 inches thick, and the Palmer B coal bed is 3 feet 7 inches thick. Maps H and I on plate 4 show the distribution of resources for the Palmer A and Palmer B coal beds, respectively. Graphic sections of these beds are shown on plate 3 (map loc. 82).
Carbon coal bed.-The Carbon coal bed has been extensively mined along a south-plunging syncline east of Bayne. On the west limb of the syncline this bed occurs as two beds, separated by an interval of about 27 feet, which Evans (1912, p. 189) called the No.1 and No. 2 beds. The beds were called the Big and Little Carbon beds by 'Varren, Norbisrath, Grivetti, and Brown (1945). The two beds merge on the east limbo£ the syncline. The Carbon bed averages about 9 feet thick. Plate 4, map L, shows the distribution of resources of the Carbon coal bed, and plate 3 (map loc. 10) shows a graphic section.
Bayne coal beds.-The Bayne coal beds are separated from the Carbon coal bed by a southeast-trending fault. The Bayne beds are, from oldest to youngest, the Bayne Nos. 1, 3, and 5 coal beds. The Bayne No. 1 coal hed is about 5 feet 10 inches thick; the No. 3 bed is 3 feet 11 inches thick; and the No. 5 bed is 4 feet 91;'2 inches thick. Graphic sections of the Bayne coal beds are shown

Occidental coal beds.-Unpublished mine maps indicate that there are at least 10 coal beds in the Occidental coal zone west of Bayne. However, data are sufficient to allow estimation of resources for only five of these Occidental beds-the Occidental Nos. 14, 6, 3, 2, and 1 coal beds (pl. 3, map loc. 53). The Occidental No. 14 bed is 5 feet thick; the No.6 bed is about 3 feet thick; the No. 3 bed is 9 feet 8 inches thick; the No. 2 bed is 3 feet 4 inches thick, and the No. 1 bed is 5 feet 6 inches thick. Fossil leaves collected from the Occidental No. 6 coal bed (USGS paleobotany loc. 9733) were assigned to the late Fultonian Stage by Wolfe (1968). This bed is therefore considered to be approximately equivalent to the Big Dirty bed of the Franklin coal zone. Maps E, L, D, F, and H on plate 4 show the distribution of resources for the Occidental Nos. 14, 6, 3, 2 and 1 coal beds, respectively.
Old Carbon coal bed.-The Old Carbon coal bed is n. thick zone of coal, impure coal, and partings. The bed is estimated to have 5 feet 4 inches of coal resources. A sm'all amount of the Old Carbon bed was strip mined west of Bayne. Plate 4, map A, shows the distribution of resources of the Old Carbon coal bed.
Cumberland coal bed.-The Cumberland coal bed is about 350 feet stratigraphically above the Old Carbon coal bed west of Bayne. The Cumberland bed, which was previously unnamed, is 7 feet 4 inches thick where exposed in a strip pit in the NEt}t sec. 21, T. 21 N., R. 7 E. This bed is tentatively considered to be approximately stratigraphically equivalent to the Franklin No. 10 coal bed. Plate 4, map B, shows the distribution of resources of the Cumberland coal bed.
Iludson No.1 coa,l bed.-The Hudson No.1 coal bed east of Palmer contains, according to Evans (1912, fig. 38), 3 feet 4lj2 inches of coal (pl. 3, map loc. 1). Plate 4, map J, shows the distribution of resources of this bed.
Deep Creek coal bed.-The Deep Creek coal bed (here named) crops out in a roadcut in the SE1,4NW1,4 sec.
23, T. 21 N., R. 7 E. It is 6 feet thick. Plate 4 map K.,
shows the distribution of resources for this bed.
WALKER LAKE-CUMBERLAND AREA
Eu?·elca co-al beds.-The Eureka coal beds are, from oldest to youngest, the Eureka Nos. 1, 2, and 3. They are 4 feet 4 inches, 4 feet 2 inches, -and 2 feet 7 inches thick, respectively. A graphic section of the Eureka No. 3, coal bed is shown ,Qn plate 3 (map ]oc. 22). The Coal Creek fault probably separates these beds from theNavy coal beds on the south. On the basis of fossil leaves (USGS paleobotany loc. 1025), Wolfe (1968) assigned the Eureka beds to the upper Ravenian Stage. There-

fore, these beds are considered to be a-pproximately equivalent to the Gem and Harris coal beds of the Franklin coal zone. Maps Il, G, and D on plate 4 show the distribution of coal resources of the Eureka Nos. 1, 2, and 3 coal beds respectively.
Navy coal beds.-The Navy Nos. 4 and 6 coal beds are considered as one bed in the resource estimates. These two beds contain an average total thickness of 6 feet 3 inches of good coal. No thickness data are available for the overlying Navy No. 3 coal bed, and the bed is not included in the resource estimates. Fossil leaves collected from strata directly overlying the Navy Nos. 4 and 6 coal beds (USGS paleobotany loc. 9734) were assigned to the early Fultonian Stage by Wolfe (1968). These beds are therefore approximately equivalent to the Franklin No. 12 coal bed. The distribution of resources of the Navy Nos. 4 and 6 coal beds is shown on map E of plate 4.
.Yellow Jacket coal bed.-The Yellow Jacket coal bed overlies the Navy No.3 coal bed (fig. 18). The Yellow Jacket bed is 4 feet thick. Plate 4, map G, shows the distribution of resources for this bed. A graphic section is shown on plate 3 (rnap loc. 85) .
Independent No. 6 coal bed.-The Independent No. 6 coal bed is a thick zone of coal, impure coal, and shale. The thickness of coal was interpreted as 7 feet from the graphic section by Evans (1912, fig. 49, p. 197). The distribution of resources for the Independent No. 6 coal bed is shown on map I of plate 4.
Swnset coal beds.-Resources are estimated for two Sunset coal beds, the Sunset Nos. 1 and 2. Several other Sunset coal beds have been reported, but data on their thicknesses and locations are lacking, so these beds conld .not be included in the resource estimates. The Sunset No. 1 coal bed, about 4 feet 8 inches thick (pl. 3, map loc. 66), is of subbituminous rank, whereas the Sunset No. 2 coal bed is of bituminous rank. In the resource calculation, the U.S. Bureau of Mines (1931, p. 112) reported thickness. of 3 feet was used. This measurement evidently included only part of the bed; Evans (1912, fig. 46) showed about 11 feet of coal and shaly coal. Elsewhere, Evans (1912, p. 195) indicated about 61;2 feet of coal for the Sunset No.2 bed. Maps K and I on plate 4 show the distribution of resources for the Sunset Nos.1 and 2, respectively.
CEDAR MOUNTAIN AREA
A major northwest-trending fault cuts through the Cedar Mountain area, and coal beds could not be correlated across this fault. East of the fault are the Cedar Mountain A, No. 1, and No. 2 coal beds. Data are insufficient to allow estimation of resources for the

Cedar Mountain A coal bed. The Cedar Mountain No. 1 coal bed is 11 feet 11 inches thick (Evans, 1912, p. 115). The Cedar Mountain No. 2· coal bed is about 3~~ feet thick. West of the fault, resources ·are estimated for the New Lake Young, Ryan No. 1, Ryan No. 2, Discovery, Jones, and Cavanaugh No.2 coal beds. The New Lake Young bed is 4 feet 5 inches thick. The Ryan Nos. 1 and 2 coal beds are 9 feet and 4 feet 9 inches thick, respectively. The Discovery coal bed is 5 feet 3 i~ches thick. The Jones coal bed aver'ages about 6 feet 3 inches in thickness. The Cavanaugh No. 2 coal bed is about 31;2 feet thick. Thickness data from the U.S. Bureau of Mines (1931, 1941) were used for the beds west of the fault. Graphic sections of the New Lake Young, Ryan No.2, .Jones, and Cavanaugh No.2 coal beds are shown on plate 3 (map locs. 42, 45, 61). The New Lake Young coal bed is of bituminous rank. All other coal beds in the Cedar Mountain area are of subbituminous rank. The distribution of resources in the Cedar Mountain area is shown on plate 4, maps D, F, and G-L.
TAYLOR AREA
The coal beds of the Taylor area are all of bituminous rank. Ten coal beds have been mined in this area. They are, from oldest to youngest, the Taylor Nos. 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 31;2, 3, 2, 1, and 0. The Taylor No.7 coal bed is not thick enough to be included in the resource estimates, and no thickness data are available for the Nos. 31;2 and No. 9 beds or for the Evans "0" bed. The stratigraphic position of bed No. 3 is not known and so was not shown on the columnar section for the Taylor area (fig. 18), but the position of No. 9 and the Evans "O" beds are shown, even though there is no record of their having been mined. The thicknesses of the Taylor coal beds included in the resource estimates are: No. 8 bed, 3 feet 10 inches; No. 6 bed, 4 feet 71j2 inches; No. 5 bed, 3 feet 10 inches; No. 4 bed, 2 feet 81;2 inches; No. 3 bed, 3 feet 5 inches ; No. 2 bed, 3 feet 8% inches; No. 1 bed, 61;2 feet; and No. 0 bed (unnamed bed of U.S. Bureau Mines, 1941), 6 feet 71;2 inches. Data for the Taylor No. 0 coal bed are from the U.S. Bureau of Mines (1941, p. 60-61), and for the Taylor Nos. 1 and 8 coal beds, from Evans (1912, p. 137-139) . Thicknesses of all the other beds are from the U.S. Bureau of Mines (1931, p. 136-137). Graphic sections of the Taylor Nos. 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 coal beds are shown on plate 3 (map loc. 67).

Resources are estimated for two beds in the Tiger Mountain area, the Tiger Mountain Nos. 1 and 3 coal

beds. Both beds are of subbituminous rank. The Tiger Mountain No. 1 coal bed a,verages about 4 feet 2 inches in thickness (U.S. Bureau Mines, 1931, 1941). The Tiger Mountain No. 3 coal bed is 6 feet thick, according to a company report (G. W. Evans, written comun., 1940) . The Tiger Mountain No. 2 coal bed is between the Tiger Mountain Nos. 1 and 3 beds, but it is too thin to be included in the resource estimate (U.S. Bureau Mines,
1931, p. 123). G. ,V. Evans (wri1tten commun., 1940) re-
ported two coal beds 4 feet thick underlying the Tiger Mountain No. 3 coal bed, but data on the extent and quality of these beds were insufficient to include them in the resource estimates. Maps J and K on plate 4 show the distribution of resources for the Tiger Mountain No. 1 and No. 3 coal beds, respectively. A graphic section of the Tiger Mountain No. 3 coal bed is shown on plate 3 (map loc. 70).
ESTIMATE OF TOTAL POTENTIAL RESOURCES
The estimate of 613 million tons of coal for the area of this report (p. 48) is based on data available on thickness and extent of individual coal beds and does not represent the total amount of coal present. Additional data on thickness and extent of coal beds through core driliing, mining, and trenching would greatly increase the above estimate. Much coal is present in beds of unknown thickness and in beds that have yet to be discovered, especially in the eastern part of the Cumberland quadrangle. In addition, the Tiger Mountain Formation probably conta.ins coal, and much of the area covered by glacial drift for several miles on either side of the Cedar River is probably underlain by a thick sequence of coal-bearing rocks. The writer estimates a total potential resource of about 5 billion tons· of coal within 6,000 feet of the surface in the Cumberland, Hobart, and Maple Valley quadrangles. The extension of this coal estimate to a depth of 6,000 feet was necessitated by the poor stratigraphic and structural control in the Cedar River Valley area.
OIL AND GAS POSSIBILITIES
Petroleum exploration in western Washington has been slow a.nd sporadic, but interest is expected to continue for many years beoause of the occurrence of marine rocks-a likely source for petroleum. Marine rocks· are present in the Raging River Formation and may underlie most of the Hobart and Maple Valley quadrangles. A possible indication of the former presence of petroleum in the rocks of this area is a black deposit containing organic carbon that coats grains of sand in the Tiger Mountain Formation in the S1f2SW1,4 sec. 17, T. 23 N., R. 7 E. This deposit may represent a hardened

residue of petroleum from which the more volatile constituents have been lost.
Assuming that suitable source beds for petroleum exist nt depth, exploration. should be directed toward finding n. favorable structural or stratigraphic trap where fluid hydrocarbons have accumulated. The rocks in the ma.pped areas are folded into a number of easily recognized anticlines that are favorable for oil accumulation, but where the rocks are sufficiently porous and permeable to serve as reservoirs at depth is unpredict!lble. In n. sequence of marine and nonm!lrine str!lta, permeable rocks may occur as elongate lenses of wellsorted sllnd deposited as offshore bars par!lllel to the st.rand 1ine. Sandstone lenses of this ~type may exist in the subsurface rocks of this area, particularly along the nncient shoreline that probably lay parallel to the westtrending hinge line that existed ne!lr ,the common boundary of the Hobart and Cumberland quadrangles.
QUICKSILVER DEPOSITS
Deposits of cinnabar occur at two places in the canyon of the Green River in rocks of the Puget Group: (1) along the crestline of the Lawson anticline rut the site of the Roy!tl Reward mine, ·and (2) along the northwest-trending fault in the NE1,4 sec. 17, T. 21 N., R. 7 E., at the site of the Cardinal Reward mine. Only n. few flasks of mercury have been produced from these two deposits, and the mines were 1iot operating in 1961. The cinnaba.r is closely associated with realgar and orpiment, both of which are more conspicuous than cinnaba.r. The rocks !lt both localities have been fractured nnd brecciated, and the cinnabar occurs in small lenses and ve.ins in the brecciated zone. At the Royal Reward mine the mineralized zone is in sandstone and carbonaceous shale below an igneous sill along the crestline of the Lawson anticline. Near the Cardinal Reward mine,the mineralized zone is confined chiefly to the zone of brecciated rock next to the northwest-tending fault.
