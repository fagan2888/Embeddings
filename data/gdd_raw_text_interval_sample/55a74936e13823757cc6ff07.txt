GEOLOGIC MAP OF THE INDIAN SPRING QUADRANGLE, SAN BERNARDINO COUNTY, CALIFORNIA
INTRODUCTION
Eruptive rocks of the Cima volcanic field occur almost entirely within six 7.5 minute quadrangles, Indian Spring, Marl Mountains, Granite Spring, Cow Cove, Solomons Knob, and Valley Wells. The following description applies to all six quadrangles.
The Cima volcanic field is a small (-300 km^) Tertiary-Quaternary alkaline basalt field in the Ivanpah highlands (Hewett, 1956), in east-central Mojave Desert (Fig. 1). The basaltic rocks, which range from late Miocene to Holocene, were erupted from at least 71 vents. The younger vents are well-formed cinder cones, whereas older vents are marked by degraded cinder cones, plugs, and crater-fill lava flows.
The volcanic rocks were described in a general geologic study by Hewett (1956). The southern part of the field was mapped by Barca (1966), and fie northern part by DeWitt (1980). Topical studies of the volcanic field include the geomorphology of pediment domes (Sharp, 1957; Dohrenwend and others, 1984a,b), geomorphic and soil evolution of the lava flows (Wells and others, 1984; McFadden and others, 1984), paleontology and stratigraphy of Tertiary and Quaternary deposits of the Shadow Valley Basin (Reynolds and Nance, 1988), structural studies (Hewett, 1956; Dunne, 1977; Reynolds, 1990; Skirvin and Wells, 1990), polycyclic volcanism (Renault and Wells, 1990), and evolution of the upper mantle and lower crust beneath Cima based on xenoliths in the basalts (Wilshire, 1990; Wilshire and others, 1991). Mineral resource assessments entailed new geologic mapping in the volcanic field (Greenwood, 1984; Wilshire and others, 1987), and a number of theses have been written on various aspects of the area. The present mapping began as part of a Wilderness Study Area mineral resource assessment, and will be combined with new mapping by R.E. Reynolds in the Solomons Knob and Valley Wells quadrangles, which include the northern part of the Cima volcanic field. Other current studies include isotopic and trace element investigation of the basalts (Farmer and others, 1991), and investigations of detachment faulting (Reynolds, 1990; Davis and others, 1990).

GEOLOGIC SETTING
The Cima volcanic field is located near the eastern boundary of the Mojave structural province (Fig. 1), an area thought to be characterized by Quaternary NW-trending strike-slip or dextral faults and Tertiary detachment faults (Dokka, 1983,1986; Glazner and others, 1989; Skirvin and Wells, 1990; Brady, 1990; Howard and Miller, 1991).

The volcanic field is underlain by Prpterozoic metamorphic and igneous rocks (DeWitt, 1980; Wooden and Miller, 1990), Proterozoic and lower Paleozoic sedimentary rocks (Calzia, 1991), Cretaceous granitic rocks and dikes of the Teutonia batholith (Beckerman and others, 1982), and Miocene terrestrial basin deposits (Reynolds and Nance, 1988). The occurrence of thin septa of Proterozoic rocks in rocks of the Teutonia batholith and the great abundance of dikes of the Cretaceous rocks in adjacent Proterozoic rocks indicate that rocks of the Teutonia batholith lie at shallow depth throughout most of the map area. Gravity data (Wilshire and others, 1987) indicate the presence of rocks of the Teutonia batholith to depths of about 10 km (R.C. Jachens, oral comm., 1991).
The Miocene basin-fill deposits range from freshwater limestone and fine-grained clastic rocks to extremely coarse fanglomerates and avalanche deposits; the coarse-grained sediments contain a spectacular array of interspersed landslide blocks composed of Proterozoic, Paleozoic, and Mesozoic rocks derived from outside the area of the volcanic field (Hewett, 1956; Dunne, 1977; Reynolds and Nance, 1988; Wilshire, 1991; Reynolds, 1992). The 18.5 Ma Peach Springs tuff (Nielson and others, 1990) occurs locally in the oldest deposits of the Miocene basins, and 12.8 Ma andesite flows (the 12.8 Ma age is a K/Ar date on a plagioclase separate from altered andesite; a whole rock K/Ar date on very fresh pyroxene andesite from the Granite Spring quadrangle yielded an age of 12.1 Ma) (Table 1) and breccias provide a useful marker higher in the section. The character of deposits in the middle and upper basin fill indicates the presence of steep slopes and active tectonism at the basin margins. Internal unconformities indicate that basinforming processes and infilling were contemporaneous, as inferred by Nielson and Baratan (1990) and Duebendorfer and Wallin (1991) for Miocene basins along the Colorado River extensional corridor (Howard and John, 1987).
Formation of pediment domes on topographically high areas of the Teutonia batholith probably began before eruption of the oldest basalts at about 7.5 Ma (Turrin and others, 1985) as inferred by Sharp (1957), Dohrenwend and others (1984), and Turrin and others (1984) for the Cimacito dome (Fig. 2). Dohrenwend and others (1984b) and current mapping results indicate that at least the Granite Spring, Halloran Wash, Indian Spring, Valley Wells, and Solomons Knob domes (Fig. 2) also predate the basaltic volcanism and are now being exhumed from beneath the coarse Miocene sediments and the younger basalts. Formation of the pediment domes may have begun during development of the older erosion surface recognized in the Halloran Hills by Reynolds (1992); this surface is older than the 18.5 Ma Peach Springs tuff and basal Miocene sediments that lie between the tuff and the erosional surface. Pedimentation is, however, a continuing process, and is now actively affecting exposed parts of all of the domes (Dohrenwend and others, 1984). The Shadow Valley dome (informally named here; Fig. 2) is unique in that its southern part is underlain dominantly by Proterozoic rocks. The Valley Wells dome (informally named here; Fig. 2) has very low relief and is mostly buried beneath Tertiary sedimentary rocks and younger alluvium; the overlapping Tertiary rocks include fine-grained lacustrine clastic rocks such as occur in the deeper parts of the Miocene basins; these rocks are overlain by gravels intercalated with carbonate breccia slide blocks.
Partial (Granite Spring dome) to complete (Halloran Wash dome, and probably also the Valley Wells dome) burial of pediment domes by fine- to coarse-grained Miocene sediments suggests that pedimentation was underway at the time of mid-Miocene sedimentation and doubtless contributed to it However, the extremely coarse character of much of the mantling sediment, as well as the presence of large gravity slide blocks on the tops of the Squaw Mountain and Solomons Knob domes, indicate that the domes lay within the Miocene basins and most of the Miocene deposits were derived from outside of the present area of the domes, as inferred by Reynolds (1991).
The thickest sections of Miocene deposits occur in the Solomons Knob quadrangle toward the north end and west of the Cima volcanic field, and in the Indian Spring quadrangle south of the

southern limits of the volcanic field. The northern section consists of three units: (1) discontinuous basal conglomerate rich in quartzite clasts, lacustrine shale, fine-grained sandstone, limestone, and pyroxene andesite breccia overlying the Peach Springs tuff on the east flank of the Squaw Mountain dome; (2) gravity slide blocks that lie directly on the erosional surface developed on rocks of the Teutonia batholith; and (3) an upper unit of coarse gravel beds intercalated with gravity slide blocks of Paleozoic carbonates, Proterozoic gneisses, and Cretaceous granitic rocks (Reynolds, 1991,1992). The gravity slide blocks attain dimensions larger than 1.5 km long and 150 m thick. Slide blocks deposited directly on rocks of the Teutonia batholith or the basal lacustrine sediments, were then surrounded by coarse gravels and breccias that attain a thickness of as much as 1.5 km (unless the section is duplicated by undetected faults). Pyroxene andesite flows, considered to be equivalents of the pyroxene andesite breccia to the north, crop out a short distance south of Interstate Highway 15 in the southern part of the Solomons Knob quadrangle and locally in the southern part of the Granite Spring quadrangle, but the Peach Springs Tuff and representatives of the fine-grained lacustrine sediments are only very locally present near Squaw Mountain. Small outcrops of the Peach Springs Tuff without associated lacustrine sediments also occur in the Granite Spring quadrangle. Distinctive oxidized coarse sand and gravel beds belonging to unit (3) occur only north of Interstate Highway 15.
The Miocene section south of Interstate Highway 15 is separable only into Peach Springs tuff, a moderately extensive basal conglomerate rich in clasts of quartzite, probably less than 50 m thick, and an upper unit of coarse gravel beds and avalanche deposits dominated either by clasts of Proterozoic rocks or of rocks of the Teutonia batholith. Gravity slide blocks of Proterozoic(?) carbonates, quartzite, and gneiss occur only in the southwestern basin deposits in the Indian Spring quadrangle, but no slide blocks of Cretaceous granitic rocks are present. The Miocene basins south of Interstate Highway 15 were apparently not as deep as those to the north so that the basal lacustrine sediments are absent Quartzite clasts in the basal gravel beds commonly are wellrounded and must have been transported substantial distances. They may represent residual deposits formed before the onset of Miocene basin formation; such deposits may have been reworked and concentrated in the initial stages of basin infilling.
The locations of basalts dated by Tunin and others (1984) and new K/Ar dates of basalts and other rocks in the map area are shown on each quadrangle; relevant data are provided in Table 1. Basalts were erupted from about 7.5 Ma to as recently as 60 ± 30 ka based on whole rock K/Ar dating (Turrin and others, 1984), or about 20 to 30 ka based on the less well-tested method of cosmogenic ^He and 2 INC in varnish on flow surfaces (Wells and others, 1991), or 330 to 400 yr based on l^C of charcoal in the base of flow f2-l, Indian Spring Quadrangle (Katz and Boettcher, 1980); flow f2-l has been dated by 40Ar/39Ar at 119 ± 38 ka by Turrin and Champion (1991). These inferred ages are conflicting ages for the same flow units, or flows whose relative ages are known, and remain to be resolved. There is a well-documented hiatus of eruption between 3 and 1 Ma, and an overall difference in composition between older and younger basalts, the older ones being generally hypersthene-normative and younger ones nepheline-normative (Turrin and others, 1985; Wilshire and others, 1991). There is no systematic geographic distribution of eruptions with time in the field, except that no volcanic rocks younger than about 4.5 Ma occur in the northern part of the field (north of Interstate Highway 15). Vents within areas of Miocene sediments commonly began with a phreatic (maar) cratering phase, which subsequently was supplanted by cinder and flow eruptions. The common occurrence of multiple flows (2 to 6), some of distinctly different geomorphic age, from the same vent (Turrin and others, 1984), as many as three overlapping craters in the same cinder cone, and several cinder cones within a single maar crater, all point to polycyclic volcanism, rather than a single eruptive episode for each vent, but there is no evidence for a significant time lapse between eruptions. (Reneault and Wells, 1990, infer major time lapses between "polycyclic" eruptions from individual Cima vents, their Crater A and Crater U study sites (Vents 1-2 and 24-25 of this study) are not appropriately used to assess the time

elapsed during polycyclic eruptions, because each of them is composed of two distinctly different vents).
Eruption of the basalts in a setting of active downwasting inferred by Dohrenwend and others (1984) is amply confirmed by this mapping. Evidence cited by Dohrenwend and others (1984) for contemporaneous volcanism and erosion was that active erosion between eruptions not greatly separated in time caused diversion of younger flows around higher older flows. A good example of this are the flows from vents 28 and 29 in the Granite Spring Quadrangle. Additional evidence includes remnants of maar beds at the bottom of a drainage that dissects flow 15-1 in the Marl Mountains Quadrangle. More impressive evidence is found in the southwestern Solomons Knob Quadrangle, where vents 59 and 61-68 formed on the sides and at the bottom of a 150 mdeep canyon cut through slightly older basalt flows.
There is no evident structural control on volcanism in the Cima field. What appear to be essentially contemporaneous vents fall on "alignments" varying by more than 90°. Although it has been suggested that extensional deformation caused the formation of the Miocene basins, and may have continued after filling of the basins (Reynolds, 1990; Davis and others, 1990; Wilshire, 1988), the evidence remains inconclusive.
Evidence of young deformation is seen in the relative uplift of Pliocene lacustrine sediments (Valley Wells quadrangle). These lake beds, which include an ash bed tentatively correlated with the 2.2 Ma Huckleberry Ridge ash, and younger deposits have been uplifted about 60 m on the east side of the volcanic field (Reynolds, 1990). Other evidence of young tectonism is provided by relative downwarping of the Soda Lake trough on the west side of the volcanic field after 3.9 Ma, as indicated by perched gravel beds (Granite Spring quadrangle) containing clasts of 3.9 m.y. basalt lying 40 m above active washes (Wilshire, 1991). Several other workers have mapped faults offsetting basalts of Miocene (Hewett, 1956) or younger age (Greenwood, 1984; Skirvin and Wells, 1990), but these have not been confirmed in the present mapping. Tight folds with NE-trending axes occur locally in fine-grained sediments of late Miocene age in the northern part of the Cima field. Such folds could reflect N-S contraction in the Mojave structural province as suggested by Bartley and others (1990), but the exposed structures in the Cima volcanic field are quite small. Moreover, subdomains of compressional deformation in a general setting of extension has been documented by Pettinga (1991).
The broad domal uplifts shown by orientation of foliations in Proterozoic rocks in the Halloran Hills (DeWitt, 1980) do not occur south of Interstate Highway 15. Although foliations in the Proterozoic rocks commonly have shallow dips, they generally have the same direction of dip within continuous outcrops. Irregularities in attitudes of foliations most commonly result from faulting, but in some areas (e.g., the largest outcrops of Proterozoic rocks in the Granite Spring and Cow Cove quadrangles) the foliations are complexly deformed on a scale of meters. Many steep faults, with gouge zones to several meters wide, cut the Proterozoic rocks. A few of these offset Miocene sediments against Proterozoic rocks, and are normal faults or have apparent lateral offsets of no more than a few 10s of meters. Steep zones of intense brecciation and faulting as wide as 300 m affect Proterozoic rocks in the Indian Spring quadrangle.
GENERAL DESCRIPTION OF UNITS Proterozoic and Paleozoic Rocks
Early Proterozoic rocks of the area were metamorphosed in the Ivanpah orogeny approximately 1.7 Ga (Wooden and Miller, 1990). These rocks are gneisses derived from a

variety of protoliths, including sedimentary, plutonic igneous, and volcanic rocks (DeWitt and others, 1984,1989; Nielson and others, 1987; Wooden and Miller, 1990). Quartzose and pelitic sedimentary protoliths are inferred from highly siliceous gneisses, such as are common in the Seventeen Mile Point area along the southwestern edge of the Indian Spring quadrangle, and from aluminous gneisses common in the southern part of Indian Spring and Marl Mountains quadrangles. Metavolcanic rocks are mostly greenstones that likely are intrusives whose age is not known; amphibolites are uncommon. Metaplutonic rocks include mafic gneisses, commonly with well-developed ptygmatic folding of felsic segregations, strongly banded gneisses of intermediate composition, and less common strongly foliated gneisses of granitic composition.
Late Proterozoic and/or lower Paleozoic sedimentary rocks occur locally, and consist of quartzite, quartzite conglomerate, medium-grained white marble, fine-grained weakly metamorphosed limestone and dolomite, and green to black slate. Some of these rocks may represent the Pahrump Group (Hewett, 1966; Dunne, 1977), possibly including members of the Crystal Spring and Kingston Peak Formations (Calzia, 1991). In places the rocks rest unconformably on Early Proterozoic gneisses, and in others are in fault contact with the gneisses. The two occurrences of white marble (one in the Solomons Knob quadrangle north of Interstate Highway 15, the other in the Cow Cove quadrangle) are both in contact with mafic plutonic rocks of the Teutonia batholith; the contacts are parallel to bedding of the marbles. In both occurrences, relatively thin marble beds are interbedded with a dark, quartz-rich gneiss, and in both places sills of the Cretaceous rocks occur among the interbedded marbles and gneisses.
Cretaceous Rocks Rocks of the Teutonia batholith (Beckerman and others, 1982) in the Cima area are plutonic representatives of late Mesozoic calcalkaline arc magmatism (Burchfield and Davis, 1981). Ages range from 97 to 90 Ma (DeWitt, and others, 1984). The rocks consist mostly of biotite monzogranite, with less abundant biotite-rich granodiorite, biotite-hornblende quartz dionte, and very felsic granite. The rocks generally are coarse grained, but locally are interleaved with fine grained varieties. They are either nonporphyritic or contain K-feldspar phenocrysts. Quartz dionte and granodiorite, which form the oldest intrusives, are complexly intruded and partially assimilated by the monzogranite. Rocks of intermediate composition commonly have abundant inclusions of quartz diorite and granodiorite. Aplite, pegmatite, and fine-grained granite dikes occur in at least two generations, one emplaced in mafic plutonic rocks, the other emplaced in both mafic and felsic plutonic rocks; crosscutting relations between the two sets occur in the Cow Cove quadrangle. Complex intrusive contacts between rocks of the Teutonia batholith and Proterozoic rocks are welldisplayed. In addition to abundant aplite and pegmatite dikes, the waning stages of Cretaceous magmatism are represented by dike swarms that are especially well-displayed in the Granite Spring pediment dome. The dikes range from hornblende/biotite andesite(?) through intermediate dacite (some with distinctive large pink K-feldspar phenocrysts) to rhyolite. Two dikes in the Granite Spring quadrangle yielded K/Ar ages of 88.2 and 90.7 Ma (Table 1). The quartz diorite, granodiorite, and monzogranite host rocks of the dikes commonly are deeply weathered, and, in places, only the continuity of less weathered dikes allows distinction of the plutonic rocks from overlying Miocene and Quaternary sediments.
Cenozoic Rocks The oldest known Cenozoic rocks in the Cima volcanic field are middle Miocene sedimentary and volcanic rocks, including the 18.5 Ma Peach Springs Tuff (Nielson and others, 1990). In the northern part of the field, the Peach Springs Tuff nonconformably overlies Teutonia granitic rocks or is locally interbedded with conglomerate, and is itself overlain by freshwater limestones, fine-grained clastic sedimentary rocks, and 12.1 to 12.8 Ma andesitic volcanic rocks. The fine-grained sediments and andesite breccias and flows are unconformably overlain by coarse terrigenous sediments, with locally interspersed fine-grained sediments. Where the Peach Springs

Tuff is absent, either lacustrine sediments or coarse Miocene conglomerate overlies Precambrian and Cretaceous rocks in nonconformable depositional contact The coarse sediments were derived from rocks like those now exposed within pre-Tertiary units of the study area, but also include, and may locally be dominated by, rock types introduced from more distant sources. For example, in the southwestern Indian Spring quadrangle, altered granitic rock is commonly a dominant clast type, but no source of sufficient volume occurs within the map area. A possible source is the Sands granite, which occurs 10-15 km to the west and south. In the northern part of the field, Miocene gravels contain clasts of Paleozoic limestone, Mesozoic sedimentary and volcanic rocks, and Proterozic syenite. These clasts appear to have their sources in the southern Clark Mountains and Mescal Range, some 30 km to the east (Reynolds and Nance, 1988).
The coarse-grained sediments include debris flows with boulders as much as 10 m or more across, derived from the Teutonia batholith and Precambrian sources. These deposits are interlayered with finer-grained fluvatile strata and coarse, essentially monolithologic avalanche deposits (Wilshire, 1991). Intercalated with these rocks is a great variety of gravity slide blocks, as large as 1.5 km long. The most conspicuous of these consist of dolomite or limestone breccia, which is resistant to erosion and stands out in the poorly consolidated, easily eroded gravel beds. However, in the Indian Spring and Solomons Knob quadrangles, the slide blocks commonly contain breccias of other metasedimentary, metavolcanic, and Precambrian gneisses, in addition to dolomite, but which are not as well exposed (Dunne, 1977; Wilshire, 1991). In the northern part of the study area, spectacular gravity slide blocks of brecciated Proterozoic and Paleozoic sedimentary rocks, Proterozoic gneisses, and Cretaceous granitic rocks occur (Hewett, 1956; Reynolds and Nance, 1988).
After extensive erosion and bevelling of tilted Miocene sedimentary rocks, alkaline basalt volcanism began in the late Miocene, about 7.5 Ma (Turrin and others, 1985). The oldest rocks form a small group of flows on the west flank of Cima dome in the Marl Mountain quadrangle. The source vents for these flows have not been identified. The old basalt flows are partly buried by younger flows and an associated cinder cone (vent 15). Isolated and clustered vents were active throughout the volcanic field until about 3 Ma, when eruptions apparently ceased for about 2 m.y. Numerous vents were active after about 1 Ma. This volcanic activity provided a rich variety of landforms, allowing important constraints to be placed on erosion rates of the granitic and metamorphic basement rocks (Dohrenwend and others, 1984), rates of surface modification of the lava flows (Wells and others, 1984), and on rates of pedogenic processes (McFadden and others, 1984). In addition, the volcanic rocks brought to the surface an unusually rich assortment of fragments of lower crustal and upper mantle rocks through which their conduits passed (Wilshire, 1990; Wilshire and others, 1991).
A thin (7-8 m) section of lacustrine sediments was deposited in the Valley Wells basin between about 2.4 Ma and 0.4 Ma (Reynolds, 1992), which consists of silstone, claystone, silty peat, and carbonate tufa. A tuff in the lower part of the section may be correlative with the 2.2 Ma Huckleberry Ridge Ash (Reynolds and Jefferson, 1988).
Erosion following initiation of basalt volcanism yielded a variety of fanglomerate deposits, ranging from late Miocene(?) to present. Older deposits generally are deeply dissected so that no original depositional surface remains. Consequently they retain little or no record of soil development Fragments of caliche generally are important members of surface clast populations. Fans of intermediate age generally have well-developed soils mantled by desert pavements. Pavements may be well-varnished where mafic clast-types are abundant, or only weakly varnished where silicic clast-types are abundant. Soils typically consist of moderately thick (2-3 cm) vesicular A horizons over argillaceous and calcic B horizons, with petrocalcic horizons at the base of the profile (Skirvin, 1990). Young deposits commonly have bar-and-swale surface textures except where granitic rocks dominate their source areas, in which case the deposits are bedded arkosic sands with smooth surfaces. Soils are poorly developed or not present. Locally in the

eastern Valley Wells and northern Solomons Knob quadrangles, Ql? and Q2 surfaces have a distinctive ribbon texture formed by alignments of shrubs approximately normal to the slope of fan surfaces; the origin of these alignments is not known.
Where basalt flows cap steep scarps, talus deposits of possible Pliocene or Pleistocene age extensively mantle slopes below the flows. Basalt boulders on the slopes are moderately- to wellvarnished. In places a platy to laminar petrocalcic horizon (Stage IV or V, Bachman and Machette, 1977) is exposed in avalanche scars; the laminae are parallel to the slope.

Qcp Playa deposits in volcanic craters (Holocene)--clay and silt of eolian origin redeposited by slope wash on crater floors
Piedmont sedimentary deposits (Holocene to Miocene?)~Light gray to reddish fanglomerate deposits about 1 m to more than 25 m thick; detritus consists of variable proportions of volcanic, plutonic, metamorphic, and sedimentary rocks. The units are subdivided on basis of geomorphic expression and degree of patination of clasts. Divided into:
Q4 Unit 4 (Holocene)--Alluvial fill of active channels: sand, pebbles, cobbles, and boulders affected by modern floods. Channels unvegetated or sparsely occupied by trees and abrasiontolerant shrubs. No soil development
Q3 Unit 3 (Holocene to Pleistocene) Undissected to little dissected alluvial deposits of unstratified to weakly stratified sand and gravel. Little or no soil development Includes colluvial and alluvial veneers 1-3 m thick on pediment domes formed on granitic rocks of the Teutonia batholith (Fig. 2). Locally divided into:
Q3b Subunit 3b~Little dissected deposits about 1 to 2 m above active channels. Bar-and-swale surface texture where boulders and cobbles present Clasts unvarnished; little or no soil development Unstratified to crudely bedded sand and sandy gravel, and boulder lenses. Moderately to wellvegetated by shrubs; where sandy, generally have intershrub lichen cover
Q3a Subunit 3a~Little dissected deposits 1 to 3 m above active channels. Bar and swale surface texture where boulders and cobbles present. Clasts lightly to moderately varnished; where present, soil horizons include: vesicular A horizon as much as 1.5 cm thick; nonargillic B horizon; thin carbonate coatings on pebbles. Sparsely to moderately vegetated by shrubs

Surface has dense pavement of pebbles, cobbles, and boulders over a substrate of crudely bedded sand and gravel, with lenticular boulder beds; on basalt flows, varnished pavements cover relatively clast-free eolian deposits (McFadden and others, 1984). Surface clasts well-varnished except where dominated by silicic igneous and metamorphic rock types. Soil horizons include: vesicular A horizon as much as 3 cm thick, argillic B horizon (details of soil horizons given by McFadden and others, 1984). Unvegetated to sparsely vegetated by shrubs
Q2a Subunit 2a~Generally well-dissected alluvial deposits 5 to 10 m above adjacent drainages, or 1 to 5 m above adjacent Q2b deposits. Sparsely vegetated by shrubs, diverse vegetation in drainages. Surface has poorly developed pavement of pebbles, cobbles, and boulders, which include caliche, except where weakly dissected. Where present, soil horizons include: vesicular A horizon as thick as 2.5 cm, over argillic B horizon
QTta Talus and colluvial deposits derived from cinder cones and basalt flows (Holocene to early Pliocene)~Pebble, cobble, and boulder veneer on slopes at base of cinder cones and beside eroded flows. Discontinuous aprons of scoria fragments on lower slopes of cinder cones. Petrocalcic horizons below basalt boulder talus attain stage IV to V and are as thick as 1 m; laminae are parallel to slope, suggesting the talus deposits form stable surfaces as old as several million years. Mapped only where identity or relations of older rocks obscured

Notes:
^Cnumbers are data from Turrinetal. (1985)
^For multiple determinations, value in parentheses is arithmetic mean used in age calculation.
^K-Ar ages were calculated using the constants for the radioactive decay and abundance of 4^K recommended by the International Union of Geological Sciences Subcommission on Geochronology (Steiger and Jager, 1977). These constants are:
X« = 0.5801x lO-lOyr1 , Xp = 4.962 x lO' 10^" 1 , and 40K/Ktotal = 1-167 x 10"4 mol/mol.
