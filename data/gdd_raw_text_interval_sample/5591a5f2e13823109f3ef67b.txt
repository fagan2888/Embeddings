Chapter 1. INTRODUCTION

Design Considerations
The Mineral Occurrence Database System (GSMODS) was developed to enhance the organization, analysis, and display of mineral occurrence information commonly used for an assessment of mineral resource potential. Assessment projects of this type generally produce a large volume of heterogeneous data that are difficult to assimilate and to summarize in a publishable form. GSMODS is a tool that can be used to improve the efficiency of the assessment process.
GSMODS was designed by first defining the various products of the system (maps and tables). Once the required products were known, the required information to be fed into the system to produce these products was easily determined. The system must be capable of producing the various tables and map overlays that are needed for the typical (and the not-so-typical) mineral resource assessment with the least effort possible on the part of the user. This broad goal implies several more specific goals. In order to generate tables that are of use to a variety of projects using diverse publication rules, the system must be flexible. The system must be capable of searching for and selecting parts of the database from the whole; it must be capable of sorting those parts or the entire database on the basis of the contained data; and it must be capable of sending the results to the computer screen for proofing, to the printer for display, and to disk for storage. The format of tabular data produced by the system must be flexible. To generate the map overlays needed for a mineral assessment project, the system must be able to find, select, and sort the data prior to generating overlays. Mineral assessments often include data which are related to specific areas such as mining districts or mineralized zones and data which are related to restricted locations such as outcrops or prospect pits. The system must be capable of displaying the outlines of areas as well as the locations of point localities.
In addition to providing the user with the products mentioned, several secondary goals were identified during the system design process. The system must be as accessible and as portable as possible; therefore, the system is implemented on a standard IBM PC (or PC clone) with standard peripheral equipment. To provide a permanent record of the information generated by each project and to make that information available to subsequent projects in machine-readable form, all data should be easily transferable to and from the U.S. Geological Survey's National Mineral Resource Data System (MRDS) without modification. MRDS is maintained by the Branch of Resource Analysis, Office of Mineral Resources, U.S.G.S., Reston, Va. A utility to make these transfers automatic will be included in a later version of GSMODS; it is not included in the current version. Production of usable map overlays depends heavily on the precision and accuracy of the location data entered into the system. To provide this

2 Chapter 1

GSMODS 1.01

Introduction

precision and accuracy at the least cost to the user, locations of points and area boundaries are transferred directly from maps to the database using a desktop digitizer. Because mineral resource databases tend to evolve as additional data are accumulated, the GSMODS data input and update facility includes full edit capability enabling the compilation of data directly on the keyboard without the necessity of first writing draft copy in a fixed entry format. Because data may be available in bits and pieces from various sources, the system will accept partial and extremely incomplete data as the database evolves. Partially complete records can be flagged if necessary so that they do not appear in tables or maps until they are more complete.
GSMODS is intended to put as few constraints on the user as possible. It is designed specifically to be used for the manipulation of metallic mineral occurrence data, but could be easily modified to accept data more useful to assessments of nonmetallic resources. Specific data items are not required for each entry; the user can enter as much or as little data as he feels will be useful for his project. Flexibility and efficiency are the prime goals of this system. Comments regarding the enhancement of these goals are appreciated by the system designer.

Hardware Requirements
The following hardware is required to run the complete GSMODS system:
1. IBM PC, XT, AT, PS/2 (has not been tested), or close compatible with at least 320K RAM, high-capacity disk drive (such as a hard disk drive or removable-cartridge disk drive), parallel printer port, and serial port
2. Printer with parallel interface
3. GTCO Digi-Pad 5 digitizer (any size) with 16-button cursor
-or-
Calcomp 9000 or 9100 digitizer (any size) with 16-button cursor and Universal Formatter Option
4. Hewlett-Packard plotter (models 7470, 7475, 7550A, 7570A, 7585/7586, 7595/7596) or equivalent plotter capable of recognizing Hewlett-Packard Graphics Language commands

Introduction

The system outlined above is the minimum necessary to run GSMODS. Additional hardware which will enhance the utility of the system includes the following:
1. Additional system memory. 512-640K RAM total is recommended
2. Numeric co-processor. Installation of an 8087, 80287, or 80387 (whichever is appropriate for the processor in the computer) speeds up the sorting process
3. A second serial port. Allows alternation between digitizer and plotter without having to switch the cables on the serial port
4. Graphics display. A graphics display (CGA or EGA compatible) allows complete maps to be generated using the combination of GSMODS and GSMAP/GSDRAW (see Chapter 6, Combining GSMODS with GSMAP and GSDRAW)
5. Hewlett-Packard 75xx plotter. Although the 74xx model plotters will work with GSMODS, they are not capable of generating filled symbols, are limited to small paper sizes, and must be run at slower communication speeds due to their limited buffer space
6. Removable-cartridge disk drive. Allows creation of large databases and makes backing-up the databases easier and faster

Software Requirements
In addition to the GSMODS distribution disks, the following software is required to run the complete GSMODS system:
1. MSDOS or PCDOS version 2.0 or later
2. Revelation, release G; either the complete package or the Run-Time system. Revelation is a commercial database management system available from Cosmos, Inc., 3633 136th Place S.E., Bellevue, Washington, 98006. The Run-Time version of Revelation is only capable of running existing applications such as GSMODS. It does not include the tools to build or modify applications programs. Nor does it include documentation describing Revelation commands
Plotted output can be enhanced by the use of GSMAP/GSDRAW (Seiner, Taylor, and Johnson, 1986) in addition to GSMODS.

Introduction

Updating a Previous Version of GSMODS
The installation procedure for updating a pre-release version of GSMODS is similar to the procedure for installing the system for the first time. The differences are noted in the installation and configuration instructions, Appendices I and II. The installation procedure will not erase existing data records.
There are new features and changes to this release of GSMODS which enhance the efficiency of the system and which correct problems with some of the pre-release versions. One of the changes to the system requires modification of older data files. This modification only affects plot parameter records which create filled symbols. In the old system, a filled symbol was created by adding 200 to the symbol number of the unfilled version of the same symbol. In the old system, selecting symbol number 5 would create an open symbol; selecting symbol number 205 would create the filled version of symbol number 5. In the current version, filled symbols are selected by preceding the symbol number with an F. The filled equivalent of symbol number 5 is selected by specifying symbol number F5. Therefore, all plot parameter records with symbol numbers greater than 200 must be changed to the new system by subtracting 200 from the symbol number and adding an F (Fill designator) before the number.
Another new feature of the current release is the addition of cross-referencing to the databases. Cross-referencing is used to index certain fields in each database so that records can be retrieved to the screen on the basis of their contents as well as by the record key. See Chapter 5 for more information on using cross-referencing. To make full use of the cross-referencing feature, existing data records must be indexed. After installing the new version of GSMODS, follow the instructions in Chapter 5 for building cross-reference indexes.

The Fast Start
Are you in a hurry to begin using GSMODS? If so, here is a list of the minimum steps necessary to get the system running:
1. Read and follow the installation instructions in Appendix I, Both Revelation and GSMODS must be installed on your system.
2. Read and follow the configuration instructions in Appendix II. GSMODS must be configured to match your computer hardware setup.

Chapter 1

Introduction

3. Start GSMODS by entering the following command at the DOS prompt:
REV {accountname}
This command is explained in the installation instructions. You can browse through the system by making choices from the Main Menu. Help is available from any entry screen field by pressing the PI function key.
There is an index at the end of this documentation for those who prefer to read about portions of the system as they need them.

The Slower Start
For a more traditional approach to learning to use GSMODS, read Chapter 2 if you are unfamiliar with the terminology of computer databases, and then read Chapter 3 for a more specific description of the GSMODS system. Chapters 4 through 6 can be read as the need arises. They are arranged in the order in which the data are normally processed: Chapter 4 describes the process of getting data into the system, Chapter 5 describes making changes to existing data, and Chapter 6 describes the process of producing reports and plots. These three chapters, along with the appendices, contain most of the reference material for the GSMODS system. Chapter 7 contains a description of the back-up and restore facilities. Understanding and using these facilities is a must once the volume of data in the system exceeds about 2 records. Re-entering information because of a failed disk is not very efficient. Finally, Chapter 8 contains most of the tabular material in this document in one place for quick reference.

Acknowledgments
The author has benefited from many discussions with R. B. Taylor and G. I. Seiner concerning the mineral resource assessment process and the design of microcomputer-based application programs. A preliminary mineral resource assessment database system, GS MRDS (Taylor, Seiner, and Johnson, 1986), formed the basis for the initial design of GSMODS. Thanks are also due to Taylor for providing the Deposit Type coding scheme used in GSMODS. The map projection routine used in the digitizing and plotting programs was modified from code originally written by M. E. Gettings (USGS). The clipping algorithm used in the GSMODS plotting program was modified from an example in Foley and Van Dam (1983). Finally, many examples of RBASIC code published in Revelation Hotline (formerly RevTech) by Analyst Research Co., Longview, WA have been useful in the development of GSMODS.

General Principles
A database system is nothing more than a collection of related pieces of information. The structure of the database system reflects the relationships between the pieces of information contained in the database. A database manager is a software tool which allows the user to define the structure of the database and which provides the user access to the database. A database system can be regarded as the electronic equivalent of a standard office file cabinet. Individual databases within the system can be thought of as electronic equivalents of the drawers in the file cabinet. The database manager performs the functions of a file clerk. The database manager chosen to implement the GSMODS system, REVELATION, is a commercial product of Cosmos, Inc., Bellevue, Washington. A copy of REVELATION, release G, is required to run GSMODS.
The GSMODS system consists of 8 interconnected databases. Each database has two names, an english name used throughout most of this documentation such as Locality database, and a system name such as MD.DATA. The 4 major databases are: Locality database, MD.DATA (contains all information that is specific to a particular site or area of interest); Reference database, MD.REF (contains bibliographic references which may contain information concerning several locations); Reporter database, MD.USER (contains data which are specific to the user of the system and data which rarely change from record to record); and Area Outline database, MD.AREA (contains the location data defining the outlines of district-type records). In addition, there are 4 secondary databases: System Setup database, MD.SYS (contains system configuration information); Report Parameter database, MD.REPORT (contains user-defined parameters for tabular report generation); Plot Parameter database, MD.PLOT (contains userdefined parameters for map overlay generation); and User-defined Symbol database, MD.SYM (contains user-defined plot symbol definitions).
Within each database in the system, the information is divided into records. A record is the electronic equivalent of a file within a file cabinet. Each record in the Locality database, MD.DATA, contains all the information that applies to a specific site or area of interest. Thus, each mine, deposit, occurrence, mining district, or mineralized area, which is considered as a distinct location by the user will be represented in the Locality database by a single record. Similarly, all of the information concerning a single bibliographic reference will be contained in one record in the Reference database, MD.REF; all of the information concerning a single reporter and the current project will be contained in one record in the Reporter database, MD.USER; and all of the geographic location information obtained from the digitizer for a district or area record in the Locality database will be contained in one record in the Area Outline

8 Chapter 2

Databases, Records, Fields, and Values

database, MD.AREA.
Each record is subdivided into fields. A field may contain a single character, such as a Y or N to indicate whether there has been production from a deposit, it may contain a word or several words such as a description of a tectonic setting, or it may contain several paragraphs of description of some aspect of the deposit. The information that is entered into a field, whether it is a single character or an entire page, is called a value. Most fields in the GSMODS system may only contain a single value. Whether the value is a character or a page, a single-valued field contains one value which can only be accessed by the database manager as a complete unit. Other fields, however, are intended to contain lists. These are called multivalued fields. Within a multi-valued field, each item in the list is a separate value and is separately accessible by the database manager. The definitions of the fields, their lengths, their acceptable data types, and their relationships to each other make up the structure of the database. The complete structure of each of the databases in the GSMODS system is detailed in Appendices V through XII. A brief summary of the information in each database follows:

Summary of Databases Contained in the GSMODS System

Conventions
Standard type styles and terminology are used throughout this documentation to indicate prompts which are displayed by the computer and information which is typed in by the user from the computer keyboard. Commands which are to be typed are shown on a separate line. Keywords which have special meaning to Revelation or GSMODS are shown in capitals. Other words which are userdefined are shown in lowercase. All words which are shown in uppercase must be typed in uppercase; all other words may contain any mix of upper- and lowercase. Words enclosed in braces ({}) are optional. Words or symbols that are printed on the screen by the system are underlined in the example commands. For example, the command
;LIST MD.DATA WITH COUNTY EQ "name"
contains three Revelation keywords (LIST, WITH, and EQ) which must be typed in uppercase, two GSMODS keywords (MD.DATA and COUNTY) which must be typed in uppercase, and one user-defined word (name) which can be mixed upper- and lowercase. Each command is "entered" or sent to the system by typing the command in the proper sequence on the computer keyboard and then pressing the RETURN key once. This key is in the same position on the computer keyboard as the Return key on a typewriter and may be marked with the word "Enter", the word "Return", or by a broken arrow to the left. When this documentation refers to one of the keys of the computer keyboard, the name of the key is printed in bold print. In the command above, the ":" is a prompt character which is printed on the screen by Revelation to tell the user that the system is finished with its last task and is waiting for further instructions.
There are several prompt characters which are used by Revelation and by the operating system (DOS is used here to refer to either PCDOS or MSDOS). In this document, C> is used to indicate a general DOS prompt. The actual DOS prompt which appears on the screen is a function of which disk drive is the current default and how the prompt string is defined. Revelation uses a j_ or a > prompt. The _L prompt is used by Revelation to indicate that it is waiting for any command. The ;> prompt is used to indicate that Revelation has made a selection from a database (by searching and/or sorting) and is waiting for a command to tell it what to do with the list of selected records. It is most commonly seen after a SELECT command. For more details about Revelation commands, see Chapters 5 and 6. Within GSMODS, prompts consist of either a phrase which describes the information which is needed, or a question. Information requests are terminated with a colon and space for the user to type the information. When the information is complete, it is sent to the system by pressing the RETURN key. Questions are usually terminated with a query and can be answered by a single

12 Chapter 3

GSMODS 1.01

Getting Started

character followed by pressing the RETURN key: Y or y for a Yes answer, N or n for a No answer. Many prompts also contain a built-in default. For example, the prompt:
Creating New Records (Default = Y) ?
has a default of Y. If the user presses the RETURN key without typing an answer to the question first, the system will assume that the default is what the user wanted and, in this case, proceed as if a Y had been entered.

Data Organization
To most efficiently use any database system, the user must have a clear picture of the desired end product before attempting to organize the information to be entered into the system. Ideally, the user should be thoroughly familiar with the reporting and plotting capabilities of the GSMODS system before creating any data records. For beginning users, this is not possible. An alternative which works well for beginning users is to create a small number of complete data records including digitized locations, then generate the desired types of reports and plots before entering additional data records. Working with the report and plot generating programs early will assure that the necessary information is correctly entered in each record. For example, if a tabular report with text in mixed upper- and lowercase (figure 17, for example) is desired, it would be a mistake to enter text into the data records all in uppercase.
The Site Type field in the Locality database is important to the organization of mineral occurrence data (see Chapter 6, Creating GSMODS reports, and Creating maps and overlays, for examples of how the contents of the Site Type field affects the products). Organizing mineral occurrence data into districts or areas with each single-locality record "belonging to" a summary (district or area) record provides the maximum flexibility in the end-product reports and plots.

Starting GSMODS
The GSMODS system consists of four main sections and several secondary sections. There are two main sections for getting data into the system (from the keyboard and from the digitizer), and two for getting data out of the system (to the printer and to the plotter). Before the system can be used, both Revelation and GSMODS must be correctly installed on the user's computer. See Appendix I (Installation of Revelation and GSMODS) if this has not been done. After Revelation and GSMODS have been installed, GSMODS must be configured for the computer hardware in use. See Appendix II (Configuring GSMODS) if this has not been done.
This section contains brief descriptions of how to accomplish each of the functions of GSMODS. For more complete

13 Chapter 3

GSMODS 1.01

Getting Started

descriptions of the procedures and possible variations, see Chapters 4, 5, 6, and 7. Once the system has been installed and correctly configured, Revelation can be started by entering:
OREV
or by entering:
(L>REV accountname
where accountname is an account name that was defined during installation. Revelation is case-sensitive; the account name must be entered exactly as it was entered during installation. If REV is entered without an account name, the system will ask for the account name after Revelation has started. If a password has been specified during installation, the system will prompt for the password before starting GSMODS.

GSMODS Menu System

GSMODS Main Menu
When the account has been selected, the system will bring up the GSMODS Main Menu (figure 1). The heading on the menu contains the name of the current application (GSMODS 1.01), the current account (bottom of the box), and the time and date. The footer for the menu contains information on how to get around in the system. When the menu first appears, choice number 1 is highlighted and the first line of the footer gives more information on the action caused by choice number 1. The highlight bar can be moved up and down the menu list by the cursor-up and cursor-down keys or by typing the number of any choice. To make a selection from the menu, highlight the desired choice and press the RETURN key. There are two function keys which are occasionally used from one of the menus. The ControlF5 key (hold down the Ctrl key and press the F5 function key) will always cause the system to exit GSMODS and return to the Revelation j_ prompt (called TCL or Terminal Command Level). The F5 key by itself has no effect within the GSMODS menu system. The F9 function key will return to the previous menu if there is one, or return to Terminal Command Level (TCL) if it is entered from the Main Menu. To return to GSMODS from Command Level, enter:
jMODS -or- jmods
Choice number 1 on the Main Menu (Edit Locality Data) starts the data entry or editing process. If number 1 is selected, the first of four Locality entry screens will appear and the system will be ready to enter information for the first data record. Before starting to enter information into the data records, defaults for the fields which are common to nearly all of the records should be set. This is accomplished by selecting choice

number 2 from the Main Menu (Login New Reporter). To return to the Main Menu from the Locality data area, enter the word END in the Record No. field of the first data entry screen. To get back to the Record No. field if data has been entered in some of the fields, enter a ! at any data entry prompt. For more information on the individual fields in the four entry screens, see Chapter 4, Getting Information In.
Choice number 2 on the Main Menu (Login New Reporter) brings up the Reporter entry screen. Before information is entered into the Locality data area, there should be a reporter defined to the system. Therefore, the first choice that is normally made on the Main Menu is to Login New Reporter. This entry screen is used to record information which is needed for each Locality data record, and which rarely changes. The information entered on this screen is copied into each Locality data record as the record is created. The user does not have to re-type this information for each record. To return to the Main Menu from this screen, enter the word END at any prompt. For more information on the individual fields in this entry screen, see the section, GSMODS Entry Screens, p. 20.
Choice number 3 on the Main Menu (Edit References) brings up the entry screen for the Reference database. This screen is used to enter each reference citation into a separate record. The references are then related to the Locality data records by a reference number. This entry screen is also available at the References prompt on the Locality entry screen so that references can be entered as they occur within the resource data. To return to the Main Menu from the Reference entry area, enter the word END in the Reference No. field. For more information on the individual fields in the Reference entry screen, see Chapter 4, Getting Information In.
Choice number 4 on the Main Menu (Digitize Locations) starts the digitizing program. It is used to enter location information directly from a map into the database system. To use the program, a digitizer must be connected to the system and GSMODS must be configured for the digitizer in use and for the correct communications parameters (see Appendix II, Configuring GSMODS and Appendix III, Hardware Installation and Configuration). Location information can be entered for individual sites (spot localities) or for lines of any type (area or district outlines, geologic contacts, faults, political boundaries, etc.). To return to the Main Menu from the digitizing program before control has been turned over to the digitizer, enter a Q at any prompt. To return after control has been turned over to the digitizer, enter a record number of 0, and then a Q or No at the next prompt. For more information on running the digitizing program, see Chapter 4, Getting Information In.
Choices 5 and 6 on the Main Menu are used to generate maps on the plotter. Choice number 5 (Setup Plot) brings up the Plot Parameter entry screen. This screen is used to define each plot before it is created. The settings and selections made on this

16 Chapter 3

GSMODS 1.01

Getting Started

entry screen are stored in the Plot Parameter database so that the plot can be repeated at any time without having to re-enter any of the information. Because the information is stored, a series of similar plots can be quickly generated by copying the plot record, making the changes that are required for the next plot in the series, and then running the plot program. To return to the Main Menu from the Plot Parameter entry screen, enter the word END at the Plot Name prompt, or enter a S at any other prompt. After a plot has been defined on the Plot Parameter entry screen, the plot can be created by selecting choice number 6 (Plot a Map) on the Main Menu. This selection runs the plotting program which then displays a list of the plots which have been defined. When a plot is selected from the list, the program generates the plot without any further action from the user. To use the program, a plotter must be connected to the system and GSMODS must be configured for the plotter in use and for the correct communications parameters (see Appendix II, Configuring GSMODS and Appendix III, Hardware Installation and Configuration). To return to the Main Menu from the plot program before starting a plot, enter a Q at any prompt. For more information on creating plots, see Chapter 6, Getting Information Out.
Choices 7 and 8 on the Main Menu are primarily used to generate tabular reports on the printer. The reports can also be directed to the display screen or to a disk file. Choice number 7 (Setup Report) brings up the Report Parameter entry screen. This screen is used to define each report format before it is created. The settings and selections made on this entry screen are stored in the Report Parameter database so that the report can be repeated at any time without having to re-enter any of the information. Because the information is stored, a series of similar reports can be quickly generated by copying the report record, making the changes that are required for the next report in the series, and then running the report program. To return to the Main Menu from the Report Parameter entry screen, enter the word END at the Report Name prompt, or enter a ! at any other prompt. After a report has been defined on the Report Parameter entry screen, the report can be created by selecting choice number 8 (Produce a Report) on the Main Menu. This selection runs the reporting program which then displays a list of the reports which have been defined. When a report is selected from the list, the program generates the report and passes it to the selected output device. To return to the Main Menu from the report program before starting a report, enter a Q at any prompt. For more information on generating reports, see Chapter 6, Getting Information Out.
Selecting choice number 9 (Utilities) from the Main Menu brings up a second menu which has five entries (figure 2). The choices on the Utilities Menu are described in the section GSMODS Utilities Menu, p. 18. The use of the function keys is the same as was described for the Main Menu, p. 14. To return to the Main Menu from the Utilities Menu, press the F9 function key.

Getting Started

Selecting choice number 10 (Exit Revelation) from the Main Menu terminates the current session of GSMODS and returns control to the operating system.

GSMODS Utilities Menu
The first choice on the Utilities Menu (figure 2), Change System Variables, brings up an entry screen which is used to define the hardware configuration for the system. This information should be filled in when the system is first installed. Subsequent changes will only be needed if the system hardware is changed. Detailed information on configuring the system for specific hardware is contained in Appendix II (Configuring GSMODS). To return to the Utilities Menu from the System Setup entry screen, enter the word END at the Record No. prompt.
Choice number 2 (User-defined Symbols) on the Utilities Menu brings up the entry screen which is used to create or edit userdefined symbols. User-defined symbols can be created so that the user is not confined to the symbols which are pre-defined by the system. The definition of plot symbols is rather complicated and requires an understanding of the Hewlett-Packard Graphics Language. Detailed information on the symbol definition procedure is contained in Chapter 6, Getting Information Out. To return to the Utilities Menu from the User-defined Symbols entry screen, enter the word END at the Symbol No. prompt.
Choices 3 and 4 (Back-up Data Files and Restore Data Files) on the Utilities Menu are used to make a copy of the user's data files on a separate disk from the primary data files, and to restore the primary data from the back-up copy if necessary. Data files should be backed up regularly and often. Computer disks do fail! The back-up copy (or copies if you really want to be safe) should be stored in a separate location from the primary data files. Choice number 3 runs the back-up program which copies the current account data files to the disk(s) selected by the user. Choice number 4 runs the restore program which copies one or more files from the back-up disk(s) to the current account data files. Both programs delete existing data files by writing over them; use them carefully. Because the two programs have no knowledge of the account in use, they can also be used to transfer data from one account to another. For more information on using the back-up and restore facilities, see Chapter 7, Archiving and Restoring Information. To return to the Utilities Menu from either program, enter a Q at the first prompt.
Choice number 5 on the Utilities Menu (Build CrossReferences) is used to index each of the cross-reference fields for each of the databases. Normally, cross-reference fields are indexed automatically as each record is added to the database. However, if data are imported to a database without being entered from a data entry screen or if a cross-reference index file is damaged, the index file will have to be re-built. This choice

To return to the Utilities Menu from the cross-referencing program, enter a Q at the first prompt.

GSMODS Entiy Screens
The Reporter entry screen is the one most users encounter first in the GSMODS system. For this reason, and because it is a relatively simple screen, the Reporter entry screen will be used as an example for entering information into any entry screen within the GSMODS system. Entry screen nuances which are not applicable to the Reporter entry screen will be covered in detail as they arise. The Reporter entry screen is reached by selecting choice number 2 from the Main Menu. The screen appears on the monitor as an empty form with the cursor in the Reporter's Initials field (figure 3). The information requested on this form will be stored in a single record in the Reporter database and will remain unchanged until the user returns to this entry screen and makes changes.

The Reporter Entry Screen
What is the purpose of this data entry screen? The information entered onto this screen does not change very often, but is useful for every record. To prevent the user from having to type this information into every record that is entered, it is entered once on this screen and automatically copied to every Locality data record as the data record is created. Of course, this information can be changed at any time and data records created after the change will automatically contain the new information. This technique of propagating information that does not change from record to record is used throughout the GSMODS system to enhance data entry efficiency. The reporter referred to here is the person responsible for the contents of the data records, not necessarily the person doing the actual data entry. Also, the location requested here is the default location for data records, not the location of the reporter.
The first item requested is the reporter's initials. The reporter's initials form the key to this record. The key is the name of the record used by the database manager to find the record quickly whenever it is needed. The reporter's initials are used as the key so that the user can recall the record easily without having to type his entire name each time he wants to make a change to the record. Notice that there is room for 25 characters in the space provided for initials. What happens if the reporter has more than 25 initials that he wants to use? Probably a ridiculous idea, but it illustrates an important point. No problem, just type them all in. Try it! This is an important feature of this database system. The 25 spaces only

define the amount of the field that is displayed. They do not define the maximum size of the field. In fact, the maximum size of every field in the database system is the same, 65,535 characters. So, have no fear of typing data beyond the displayed length of any field on any entry screen, just keep typing and the display will act as an electronic tickertape, always keeping the part of the field that you are currently working on in view. Terminate entry of the reporter's initials by pressing the RETURN key.
The next field is for the reporter's given names. Enter all parts of the reporter's name in their proper sequence, except the last name. Again, terminate with the RETURN key. The next field requests the reporter's last name; however, suppose a mistake has been made in spelling the first name. The cursor-up key may be used to go back to a previous field. The cursor-left and cursorright keys may be used to position the cursor within the field. Used alone, the cursor keys move the cursor one character left or right; used with the control key, the cursor keys move the cursor one word left or right. In addition, the home key takes the cursor to the beginning of the line, and the end key takes the cursor to the end of the line. The delete key deletes one character at a time. Typed characters will replace the existing characters in the default (replace) mode. The insert key will toggle between replace and insert mode. When in insert mode, typed characters will be inserted between the character indicated by the cursor and the character to the left of the cursor. When the corrections are complete, pressing the RETURN key or the cursor-down key from anywhere within the field will enter the entire corrected field; it is not necessary to place the cursor at the end of the entry before pressing the RETURN key. Enter the reporter's last name and affiliation. The use of an abbreviation for the affiliation is not recommended. Most abbreviations are not as widely recognized as most reporters would like to think.
The first four fields of this entry screen make no restrictions on the data that can be entered. Any mix of upperand lowercase characters and any length of input are allowed. The State field is a little different. Although it will allow entry of either upper- or lowercase, it will convert all lowercase letters to uppercase. In addition, it will only accept valid U.S. Postal Service (USPS) abbreviations for states (see Appendix I, the States database, for information about changing the list of acceptable state codes for localities outside the United States). Try a non-existent abbreviation such as WZ. Data checking on entry is another feature of GSMODS that is used wherever possible. Many typographical errors are caught at the entry stage while the information is still easily available. The state and country information requested in the next two fields is the default location of the data records that are to be entered, not the location of the reporter.

22 Chapter 3

GSMODS 1.01

Getting Started

After entering the default country, the prompt "No. of Entry to Change (RETURN to File Record)?" will appear at the bottom of the screen. This is called the Change prompt throughout this documentation. There is one more chance to check the entries before storing them. If any of the numbers 1-6 are entered at this point, the system will allow corrections to be made to the field with that number before storing the record. When the information is correct, press the RETURN key at the Change prompt to store the data record just created and clear the Reporter entry screen. To return to the Main Menu, enter the word END at the Reporter's Initials prompt. The information just entered in the Reporter entry screen becomes the default information for all subsequent data records which are created with the Locality data entry system (choice number 1 on the Main Menu). To change the default information at any time, return to the Reporter entry screen and either create a new record by entering a different set of initials and filling in the screen again, or enter the same initials and modify the information in the current record. In either case, the most recently accessed record will become the new default. Other options which are available at the Change prompt include: END (or Ctrl-E) to return to the Main Menu without filing the current record, TOP (or Ctrl-T) to clear the screen and start over from the top without filing the current record, and DELETE (or Ctrl-D) to delete the current record.

Map Projections
This version of GSMODS contains transformation routines for only one map projection, Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM). Maps published by the U. S. Geological Survey (USGS) and most other publishers are labeled with the projection used to produce the map. Maps in the 1:250,000 series of the Army Map Service use UTM projections, as do the 1:63,360 (15 f ) maps of Alaska published by the USGS. Overlays produced by GSMODS will match these base maps to the accuracy of the plotting device. The 1:62,500 (15 1 ) and 1:24,000 (7 1/2 f ) maps of the lower 48 states published by the USGS use a Lambert Conformal Conic or Polyconic projection. GSMODS overlays will not match these base maps exactly. However, because the plotting system includes a capability for independently adjusting the north-south and eastwest scales, the UTM projection can be used to match these maps closely enough for most purposes, particularly when plotting at large scales.

Special Characters and Terms
There are a number of characters and terms which have special meanings within Revelation and/or within GSMODS. The following table contains a list of the most commonly used special functions as well as a description of what they do and where they are used. A complete list of special functions is included in the Quick Reference section (Chapter 8).

Chapter 4. GETTING INFORMATION IN
The previous chapter (Getting Started) described the entry of data into the Reporter entry screen. The rest of the data entry screens in the system operate much the same as those on the Reporter entry screen. This chapter summarizes the rules for data entry and describes the Locality entry screens, the Reference entry screen, and the use of the digitizing program.

On-screen data entry and editing
The relationship between the space allotted to each field on the entry screen and the stored field length was described in the previous chapter. The line which is displayed on the entry screen for each field only defines the amount of the field that is displayed. It does not define the maximum size of the field. The maximum size of every field in the database system is the same, 65,535 characters.

Cursor Control Keys
The cursor control keys work in the same manner for all entry screens. The cursor-up key (up arrow on some keyboards) may be used to return to a previous field. The cursor-left and cursor-right keys (left and right arrows) may be used to position within the field. Used alone, the cursor keys move the cursor one character left or right; used with the control key, the cursor keys move the cursor one word left or right. In addition, the home key takes the cursor to the beginning of the line, and the end key takes the cursor to the end of the line. The delete key deletes one character at a time. Typed characters will replace the existing characters in the default (replace) mode. The insert key will toggle between replace and insert mode. When in insert mode, typed characters will be inserted between the character indicated by the cursor and the character to the left of the cursor. Pressing the RETURN key or the cursor-down key (down arrow) from anywhere within the field will enter the entire field; it is not necessary to place the cursor at the end of the entry before pressing the RETURN key.
Detailed descriptions of the type of information which is entered in each field are given in Appendices V through XII (Database Definitions) and are available interactively by entering a ? or by pressing the Fl key at any field prompt.

Data Entry Defaults
Many fields on the data entry screens do not have defined defaults for the first record; however, when the entry screen for the next record comes up, the value entered in the first record becomes the default for the next record. If the data records are arranged carefully, default values for many fields can be copied

26 Chapter 4

GSMODS 1.01

Getting Information In

from record to record, reducing the number of data entry keystrokes required.

Data Validation
Most data entry fields make no restrictions on the data that can be entered. Any mix of upper- and lowercase characters and any length of input are allowed. Where the choices of entry into a field are limited or where the format of the entry is fixed, input data are verified as they are entered (the State field on the Reporter information screen is an example of a verified field). Many typographical errors are caught at the entry stage while the information is still easily available. The help screens for each field and Appendices V through XII specify the valid entries for fields which are verified at entry.

Multi-valued fields
Fields which have 01> at the end of the prompt (such as Commodities on the first Localities entry screen) are multivalued (list) fields. These fields can hold a list containing any number of values. As each value is entered, it is terminated by pressing the RETURN key. The system will continue to prompt for another value as long as values are entered. When an empty value is entered (RETURN key only), the system will proceed to the next field. The default system also works with multi-valued fields. If the previous record has 5 values in a multi-valued field, all 5 can be copied to the current record by repeatedly pressing the RETURN key. If only the first two values are desired in the current record, copy them with two RETURNS, then instead of pressing RETURN for the third, enter a hyphen (-). This will terminate the default system for the current field. Any time that a blank field is desired and a RETURN alone would enter a default value, enter a hyphen instead.

Text Fields
There are several "text" fields (for example, the Production Description field on the second Locality entry screen) throughout the GSMODS system. These fields are identified by having more than one line of display space on the entry screen. Any amount of information may be entered in a text field; if typing continues beyond the end of any line of the display space, the display tickertapes to the left to show the current portion of the entry. To start typing on the next line, press the RETURN key. The field will continue to accept data until either a blank line is entered, or a RETURN is entered on the last display line. The system will then display as much as possible of the text by filling the display area completely using automatic word-wrap. Text that does not fit in the display area is retained in the record and is available for printed reports and for editing via the Change prompt.

27 Chapter 4

GSMODS 1.01

Getting Information In

Special Characters
Entering END (or Ctrl-E) at any prompt on any entry screen will terminate data entry without storing the current record and return to the GSMODS menu. Similarly, entering TOP (or Ctrl-T) will clear the screen and return to the top of the first screen of the data entry screen set without storing the current record and entering DELETE (or Ctrl-D) will delete the current record from the database.
Several special characters can be entered into data fields on all data entry screens in the system. The hyphen which terminates automatic defaulting, and the ? or PI key which call up the appropriate help screen have already been mentioned. To copy the contents of a field from the previous record if the field does not have automatic defaulting, enter a " or press the P2 function key. To skip the rest of a data entry screen and go on to the next screen without having to press the RETURN key for each field, enter a > at any prompt. Similarly, to return to a previous screen of the same record, enter a < at any prompt. Finally, if there is no more information to enter for the current record, entering a ! in any field will store the information which has been entered in the current record, and return to the first screen for entry or editing of a new record.

Change Prompt
After entering information into the last field on an entry screen, the prompt "No. of Entry to Change ?" will appear at the bottom of the screen. This is called the Change prompt throughout this documentation. Entering a number corresponding to one of the fields on the screen will allow changes to be made to that field. If the field is single-valued, the cursor will move to the first character position in the field specified. The cursor keys may be used to position within the field as described on p. 26. When editing is complete, press the RETURN key from anywhere within the field to enter the entire corrected field; it is not necessary to place the cursor at the end of the entry before pressing RETURN. When the correction has been entered, the system will return to the Change prompt awaiting the number of another field to change.

28 Chapter 4

GSMODS 1.01

If the number of a multi-valued field is entered at the Change prompt, the system prompts for the number of the value to be changed. The following options are available:

where n is the number of the value to delete Insert a value between existing values in the
multi-valued field where the new value is inserted before value n

When editing of the value is complete, press the RETURN key to enter the corrected value; it is not necessary to place the cursor at the end of the value before pressing RETURN. When the correction has been entered, the system will return to the "Which Value" prompt awaiting the number of another value to edit in the same field. To return to the Change prompt, press the RETURN key again.

To go on to the next screen (if one exists) from the Change prompt, enter a > or press the RETURN key. To return to a previous screen (if one exists) of the same record from the Change prompt, enter a <. If there are no more changes to be made to the current record, enter a ! at the Change prompt to store the current record (complete with all modifications) and return to the first screen for entry or editing of another record. If the current screen is the last screen for the record (or the only screen), pressing the RETURN key at the Change prompt has the same effect as entering a !.

The Locality Entry Screens
Most mineral occurrence data are entered into the system on the Locality entry screens. There are four screens for each data record. Selecting choice number 1 from the Main Menu brings up the first screen (figure 4) after a few seconds delay.

Locality Screen #1
The cursor starts at the Record No. field and a prompt at the bottom of the screen gives the default number of the next record. Records are numbered sequentially as they are entered into the system. If a new record is to be entered, pressing the RETURN key will insert the default number into the Record No. field. If an existing record is to be edited, the number of the

record to be edited can be entered at this time.
The next field is the Entry Date. The default date is given at the bottom of the screen. In this case, the default is the current date from the system clock (You do set the system clock when you start-up the computer, don't you?). After the date is entered, the system reads the most recently accessed reporter information record from the Reporter database and adds the reporter's name and affiliation to the data record.
The system then prompts for the name(s) for the site being described. Enter the most common or most recent name for the site in the Site Name field and all other important names in the Synonyms field. If information is being entered for a district or area, enter the district or area name in the Site Name field.
The next three fields (Record Type, Site Type, and Information Source) contain coded information and are required fields which are necessary to provide search and sort capabilities. Acceptable codes for these fields can be found in Appendix V or on the on-line help screens for each field (press the Fl function key at the appropriate field). These fields are followed by two fields (District and County) for storing the name(s) of the mining district (if one exists) and the county where the site is located. Records which describe a single site will normally only have one district name and one county name. Records which describe an extensive area may include several districts and may be located in several counties. After the last county name is entered, the system will fill in the State and Country fields from the information in the most recently accessed reporter information record.
There are several fields which can conveniently be skipped at this stage if the locations are to be entered later from the digitizer (a procedure which is strongly recommended). The 2° Quad Name, Primary Quad, Latitude, and Longitude fields of each record will be automatically filled as the locations are digitized; there is no need to enter them at this time.
The location field (Loc. (Sec,T,R) on the screen) is a freeform field for entering cadastral location information. The information may be entered in any format which is useful to the user. The location field is followed by the Commodities field which is used to store a list of the commodities which have been produced or which are important at the location. Commodities are usually entered as chemical symbols unless a mineral or industrial material is the actual final product (mica or clay, for example). The list is usually entered with the most important commodity first and the least important last.
The last two fields on the screen, Deposit Type and Deposit Code are linked. For each entry in the Deposit Type field there should be a corresponding entry in the Deposit Code field. The information which is entered in the two fields is the same, the first is entered as a text description of the type of deposit

being described and the second is entered as a code for that type of deposit. The text description can be in any form which makes sense to the user; the codes come from a list included with this document (see Chapter 8, Quick Reference, or Appendix V, Locality Database). The deposit coding scheme is included as a suggestion only. However, if all users use this coding scheme, then searches for deposit types over large databases will be possible. This type of search is not possible over the text fields because each reporter uses different words to describe the same types of deposits.

Locality Screen #2
Pressing the RETURN key at the screen 1 Change prompt brings up the second of the four screens (figure 5). The record number and name of the site are displayed at the top of this and all subsequent screens. Information for the second screen is entered in the same fashion as the first screen. The Production Code field accepts a single character (Y, N, or U) which indicates whether there has been any production from the site. It is used to sort the records which have recorded production from those which don't. The Production Description field is the first of several "text" fields on the Locality entry screens. It is a free-form field in which information about the production at the site or area may be formatted in any way which is useful to the user.
The next three fields form a linked set which are used to describe any host rocks which are known at the site. For each entry in the Host Rock Name field, the system will prompt for a lithologic description and an age for the host rock. Use the formal name for the host rock if there is one, otherwise use a complete informal name (Ksgw is not meaningful to those who work in other areas). A list of suggested abbreviations for ages to be used in all three of the age fields on this screen is available on the help screens (press the Fl key at the appropriate field). A range of ages is indicated by entering the upper and lower limits (for example, Camb-Dev). Multiple ages which are discontinuous may be separated by commas (for example, Camb, Miss).
After entering the last host rock description, the system will prompt for the age of mineralization and then prompt for a description and age for any associated igneous rocks which are known from the area. The igneous rock description and age also form a linked set. Any number of igneous rocks may be described. The final field on the second screen, Tectonic Setting, is a text field which is used to describe the tectonic setting of the surrounding area when it was mineralized or when the deposit was formed.

Locality Screen #3
Pressing the RETURN key at the screen 2 Change prompt brings up the third screen (figure 6) which operates in the same manner as the second screen. The third screen includes a multi-valued field for listing the ore minerals which are important at the site being described and three text fields. Full mineral names should be entered in the Ore Minerals field with the most important mineral listed first and the least important last. Non-ore mineralogy typically includes descriptions of gangue minerals and alteration. Ore controls may be structural, chemical, or other means of probable control of ore deposition. The Deposit Description field contains a general description of the deposit and all other important information which does not fit in any other field of the record.

Locality Screen #4
Pressing the RETURN key at the screen 3 Change prompt will bring up the fourth and final screen (figure 7). Search Keys is a free field to be used for any keywords on which the user would like to be able to easily search or sort the database. The Miscellaneous Comments field is generally used for information which does not seem to fit anywhere else in the record. This is a good field to use for speculations on deposit origin, similarity to other known deposits, etc. The Personal or Proprietary Notes field is included for the reporter's private use. When data records are copied into master regional files, this field is not included.
The only new type of field on this screen is the References field. The References field is a multi-valued field which stores the reference number of each of the applicable references for the current record. When a number is entered, the system goes to the Reference database, checks that a reference by that number exists, and displays the first line of the reference so that the user can check that it is the correct reference.
It is also possible to add references to the Reference database at this point. Entering an a in the References field instead of a reference number will bring up the Reference entry screen (figure 8). The Reference entry screen is similar to the other data entry screens in the system. More information about the Reference entry screen can be found in the section, Reference Entry Screen, p. 35. If the RETURN key is pressed at the Reference entry screen Change prompt, the system prompts for another reference number. Entering END, instead of a reference number, returns the system to the fourth screen of the data record and inserts the number of the reference just added to the Reference database into the list of references for the current data record.

Finally, at the Change prompt for the fourth data entry screen, pressing the RETURN key will file the complete record and return the user to the first screen ready to enter another record. To return to the Main Menu, enter END instead of a record number.

The Reference Entry Screen
Selecting choice 3 (Edit References) from the Main Menu brings up the Reference entry screen directly (figure 8). This is the technique of choice if several references are to be entered at one time. The Reference entry screen can also be accessed from the fourth Locality entry screen (see description on p. 33). Creating a formatted reference list from the Reference database is discussed in Chapter 6, under the section on the FORM command. The previous chapter (Getting Started) described the entry of data into the Reporter entry screen in detail. The Reference entry screen fields are similar to those on the Reporter entry screen.
When choice number 3 is selected from the Main Menu, or when an a is entered in the Locality screen References field, the Reference entry screen appears with the cursor at the Reference No. field and a prompt at the bottom of the screen showing the next default reference number. Pressing the RETURN key will enter the default reference number and move the cursor to the Authors field. To make changes to an existing reference, enter the number of the reference to change in the Reference No. field. The authors of the reference are entered in the exact format that would be used for a formal citation. No terminal punctuation should be entered into this or the following field.
After the names of the author(s) are entered, the year in which the reference was published is entered in the Reference Year field followed by the remainder of the formal citation: title, publisher, volume, pages, etc. in the Citation field. If a RETURN is entered from the Change prompt, the system prompts for another reference number. Entering END instead of a reference number, returns control to the Main Menu. More detailed information about the Reference entry screen fields is available in Appendix VI, Reference Database, and by entering a ? or pressing the PI function key at the field in question.

Entering Location Information from the Digitizer
The easiest and most accurate way to get location information into the database is by using the digitizer. Selecting choice number 4 from the Main Menu starts the digitizing program. To make use of this program, a GTCO Digi-Pad 5 or a Calcomp 9000 or 9100 digitizer must be attached to a serial port. See Appendix III (Hardware Installation and Configuration) for instructions on setting up the digitizer and connecting it to the system. See Appendix II (Configuration) for instructions on configuring the system for the digitizer in use.
The first prompt from the Digitizing program is Are you creating any new records (default = Y)?. If you have previously entered information about the locations to be digitized into the database, answer NO (n or N). If you answer NO, the system will check to see that each record exists as you enter the record number. If it doesn't exist, an error message will be generated. This facility helps to catch inadvertent errors in keying in the record numbers. If you answer the question YES (y or Y, the default), this check is omitted. At this prompt, or at any subsequent keyboard prompt, entering an ! will re-start the digitizing program at the beginning; entering QUIT (q or Q) will terminate the digitizing program and return control to the Main Menu.
The next prompt is Do you want a printed listing (default = Y) ? It is a good idea to keep a printed record of what you have done, particularly as you are getting used to the system (see example, figure 9). The default answer is YES. If you choose to have a printed listing, be sure the printer is connected and turned on. If the printer is not available, the program will wait patiently for you to turn it on, but will not warn you that it is waiting. It can be quite frustrating trying to figure out why it is not working. The program then requests the name of the primary quadrangle, which is the quadrangle that you are going to digitize from. Enter the name exactly as you would like it to appear in the Locality data records; it will be automatically inserted into the data record for each location that you digitize. Then the program prompts for the Scale of the primary quadrangle. Enter the denominator of the fractional scale without punctuation. For example, enter 24000, not 1:24,000 or 1/24000 or 24,000. The scale is used for several tasks. First, the scale is automatically entered into the Locality data record for each location digitized. Second, the scale of the map being digitized is checked to see that it corresponds to the scale entered here. If not, an error message is generated. The northsouth scale and the east-west scale of the map are also checked to see if they are reasonably close to the same. These checks catch many errors in the entry of map corners. The program then prompts for the name of the 2 ° quadrangle containing the locations to be digitized. This entry is also automatically inserted in each Locality data record as the locations are being digitized.

The program next prompts for the latitude and longitude of the corner points of the area to be digitized. It first requests the latitude and longitude of the northwest corner. All latitudes must be entered in the following format: dd mm ss N or dd mm ss 8; all longitudes must be entered in the following format: ddd mm ss E or ddd mm ss W. The map may be oriented in any direction on the digitizer as long as the corners are always entered in the correct order, northwest, southwest, southeast, northeast. The program defaults assume that the area to be digitized is rectangular; once the latitude and longitude of the northwest corner have been entered, it offers those values as defaults for the latitude of the northeast corner and the longitude of the southwest corner, etc. These defaults can be overridden if the area is not rectangular by entering the correct values for each corner. The program then asks if the corner values are correct. The user has one last chance to check that the data has been entered correctly.
A message is then printed on the bottom of the screen to be sure that the digitizer is connected and turned on. After being sure that the digitizer is on, press RETURN and the system will check and clear the communications line. This takes about 15 seconds. If a message to enter the northwest corner on the digitizer does not appear within about 15 seconds, there is something wrong with the communications between the computer and the digitizer. Sometimes it can be fixed by re-starting the system (press the Ctrl, Alt, and Del keys simultaneously to reboot the computer) and re-entering the digitization program by re-starting Revelation and GSMODS and then selecting choice number 4 from the Main Menu. Do not turn off the digitizer during the process. If it still does not work, check the settings of the digitizer and the system configuration settings (see Appendices II and III, p. 118, 122) one more time. Often the problem is in having different baud rates on the digitizer and in the system configuration file.
When the message to enter the corner on the digitizer comes up, be sure that the map is attached to the digitizer so that it cannot move and so that the corners to be used for registration are within the active area of the digitizer. From this point until all the data has been entered for this section of map, the program is run entirely from the digitizer.
Place the digitizer cursor over each corner of the map, in the correct sequence, and press the 0 key on the cursor keypad. The system will beep at each entry, and after the fourth corner, the location entry instructions will appear on the screen (figure 10) .

Digitizer Keypad Use
For each location, first enter the record number from the cursor keypad, terminating the number with the A key. On the digitizer, the A key acts as a RETURN key. A site (single point)

location is then entered by placing the cursor over the point on the map and pressing the 1 key. The system automatically calculates the latitude and longitude of the point and stores that information in the data record. Area records (mining districts, mineralized areas, etc.) should be entered into the system twice. Enter first as if it was a site location by entering the record number and then digitizing a central locality in the area with the 1 key. This places a latitude/longitude pair and the quadrangle information into the Locality data record. Then enter the record number again and digitize the outline of the area. This is done using the 0, 1, and 2 keys. Move the cursor along the outline of the area pressing the 0 key as often as you'd like a point to appear on the outline, terminating with either the 1 key or the 2 key.
The 1 key terminates the outline at the point where the key is pressed. It is used when digitizing a line which does not close upon itself within the current map segment. It is possible to continue the line on another map segment at a later time. Just be sure that the segments of the line are digitized in the order and in the direction in which the line is to be drawn. The 2 key terminates and closes the outline by adding the first point digitized to the end of the line. Thus, the 2 key should be pressed at the last point just before returning to the starting point.
The C key on the cursor keypad is used to continue a line or area outline from one map to another. A portion of the line or area outline is digitized from the first map and the line is terminated with the 1 key at the map boundary. When the adjacent map is being digitized, the record number is entered again and then the C key is entered to tell the system to Continue digitizing a previously entered line. The line is then continued using the 0 key and terminated again with the 1 key. The line can be followed through as many maps as necessary, so long as the maps are digitized sequentially along the line. If the line terminates on a map other than the original map, or if the line does not form a closed area, terminate the final line segment with the 1 key. If the line returns to the original map sheet and forms a closed area, terminate the line with the 2 key just as if the entire area had been included on a single map.
If an area outline continues on more than one map, the system does not add subsequent map names, beyond the first, to the data record. To assure a correct data record, the user must add the subsequent map names and scales to the data record in the Locality database.
If a record number is entered more than once without the C key being used, the system will assume that you want to add another line or area to an existing record. This technique can be used to enter a series of unconnected area outlines which are all described by the same Locality data record, a series of placer deposit areas, for example. It can also be used to digitize a series of lines (e.g. county outlines) by creating a

41 Chapter 4

GSMODS 1.01

Getting Information In

dummy record in the Locality database and then digitizing all of the lines using the same record number.
When the outline of an area is digitized, the system checks the record number in the Locality database to be sure it is an area record (first character of the Record Type field equals
A 1 ). If it finds that the record is a site record, the system beeps four times to indicate that an error has been made and then asks if you really meant to digitize a line for a site record. As the points and areas are digitized, the latitude/longitude pairs are displayed on the screen and listed on the printer. At the termination of a closed area outline, the system also displays the area that has been enclosed in square miles. To terminate entry from the current map segment, enter a record number of 0. The system will then ask if you'd like to digitize locations from another map. A YES answer will re-start the program at the beginning; a NO answer will return control to the Main Menu.

Error Recovery
There are several methods of error recovery from the digitizer. Single site locations can always be corrected by simply re-digitizing the record. The new information will overwrite any previous information. If a record number is entered and then the D (Delete) key on the digitizer keypad is pressed, the most recently entered line or area outline for that record will be deleted. To delete all of the lines or areas from a record, continue to enter the record number and the D key until the system informs you that all of the line segments have been deleted for that record. Thus, you can delete and re-digitize area outline information.

Chapter 5. CHANGING EXISTING INFORMATION

Modifying Information on the Data Entry Screens
To make changes to the information which is stored in any of the databases in the GSMODS system, the record which is to be changed must be displayed on the data entry screen. The data entry screen is displayed by making the same choice from the Main Menu that would be made to enter information into a new record. If a Locality record is to be changed, select choice number 1 from the Main Menu; if a reference is to be changed, select choice number 3, etc. When the correct data entry screen is displayed, the system will prompt for the key to the record to be changed (Record No., Reference No., etc.). Instead of pressing the RETURN key to create a new record, enter the key of the record to be changed. The key will be a number for records in the Locality database, Reference database, User-defined Symbol database, and System Setup database; a record name for records in the Report Parameter database and the Plot Parameter database; or the reporter's initials for records in the Reporter database.
If the key to an existing record is entered, the system will retrieve the record and display the first screen of information as it currently exists in the database. The system will then prompt for the number of a field to change (the Change prompt). Entering a number corresponding to one of the fields on the screen will allow changes to be made to that field. If the field is single-valued, the cursor will move to the first character position in the field specified. If the number of a multi-valued field is entered, the system prompts for the number of the value to be changed. Any of the cursor control keys, special characters, or functions described in Chapter 4, On-screen data entry and editing, may be used while editing an existing record.

Finding the Record to Change - Cross-Referencing
If the key to the desired record is not known, in most cases the database can be searched for the record on the basis of information which is stored in the record. The search can be based on any information which is stored in a cross-referenced (indexed) field. The Area Outline and System Setup databases have no cross-referenced fields. The following fields are crossreferenced in the remaining databases:

COMMENT TITLE
* Indicates a primary cross-reference field (see next section)

Retrieving an existing record on the basis of crossreferenced information is accomplished by entering a search parameter at the record key prompt. All search parameters begin with a \ (backslash) character.

Primary Cross-Reference Fields
Primary cross-reference fields are indicated in the list above by an * after the field name. These are the fields which are most often used to retrieve records. The only database which has fields which are secondary cross-reference fields is the Locality database. Retrieving records on the basis of the contents of secondary cross-reference fields is described in the

45 Chapter 5

GSMODS 1.01

Changing Existing Information

following section. To retrieve a record by all or part of the contents of a primary cross-referenced field, enter a \ followed by the word or words to be used for the search into the key field instead of a record key. For example, the following search parameter may be entered into the Record No. field of the Locality database.
\Amethyst
This entry in the Record No. field will cause the system to search for all records in the database which have the word Amethyst in either the Site Name field or the Synonyms field. The system ignores case for this search, so the entry may be made in either upper- or lowercase. There is no space between the \ and the search word(s). If only one record is found, the system will display the first page of the record for editing. If more than one record is found, the system will display a list of the records which match the search parameter on the Cross-reference screen, so that the correct record can be selected.
More than one word can be specified for the search by separating the words by a space. For example,
\amethyst mine
This entry in the Record No. field of the Locality database will cause the system to search for all records with both the word amethyst and the word mine in the Site Name or the Synonyms field. Retrieving by cross-referenced information works similarly for the other databases which have primary crossreference fields. Entering a \ followed by the word or words to search for will cause the system to search for records which have all the words specified in any of the primary cross-reference field(s). If more than one word is specified, all records which contain the search words in any combination of the primary crossreference fields will be selected; the words do not all have to be in the same field.

Secondary Cross-Reference Fields
Fields other than the Site Name and Synonyms fields can also be searched to find a specific record in the Locality database. These secondary cross-reference fields are shown in the list on p. 45 without an * following the field name. To use a secondary cross-reference field for the search, the system ID for the field must be specified in addition to the search word(s). System IDs for each cross-referenced field are given in the list on p. 45 as well as on the Locality database help screens. For example, to find a record which has Au entered in the Commodities field, enter
\commodities=Au
at the Record No. prompt. There are no spaces in this entry. If

46 Chapter 5

GSMODS 1.01

Changing Existing Information

only one record is found, the system will display the first page of the record for editing. If more than one record is found, the system will display a list of the records which match the search parameter on the Cross-reference screen, so that the correct record can be selected. More than one word can be specified for the search by separating the words by a space. For example,
\commodities=Au Ag
will cause the system to find all records with both Au and Ag in the Commodities field.

The Cross-Reference Screen

If more than one record in the database meets the criteria specified in the cross-reference search parameter, the system will display a Cross-reference screen to allow the user to select the desired record or to further refine the search. The Crossreference screen lists one line of information for each record which meets the criteria. At this point, the user has the choice of selecting one of the records on the list to edit, paging further through the list if it is continued on further pages, refining or changing the search, or returning to the data entry screen without making a selection. The Cross-reference screen can also be reached by entering a \ without a search word. This technique is useful if the user needs to use one of the search options other than searching for whole words. The following options are available from the Cross-reference screen:

Entry

Action

RETURN # PG#
new word

Pressing the RETURN key (NEW-LINE on screen option list) returns to the data entry screen without selecting a record
Entering a number from the selection list returns to the data entry screen and displays the selected record
Entering PG followed by a page number displays another page of the selection list. There is no space between the command, PG, and the page number
If a new word is entered, the system searches for the new word in the current cross-reference field(s). This is not a subset function; the entire database is searched for the new word. If the item being searched for is a number (such as a reference number), entering a new number at this prompt will cause the system to try to select that number record from the selection list (see #, above). To force the
system to accept the number as a new search parameter, enter key=n, where n is the desired number

47 Chapter 5

GSMODS 1.01

Changing Existing Information

R Refine the search. The system prompts for a new word and searches for the new word within the previously selected set of records. This is a true subset function
S Sub-string search. The system will search for any cross-referenced word which contains the specified sub-string and display a list of records which contain the word
(.) Continue the sub-string search. Entering a period after a sub-string search list is displayed will continue the search to the next crossreferenced word which contains the specified sub-string and display a list of records which contain the word
As an example of the use of sub-string searching, suppose the user wants to find a record with a site name of "Cotopaxi Mine", but is not sure of the correct spelling. From the Crossreference screen, the user can enter an 8 and then when the system prompts for the search string, enter cot. The system will search the index file for the first index word which contains the string cot. If the first index word it finds is "scotch", it will list all of the records which have the word "scotch" in the Site Name or Synonyms fields. The user can then enter a period and the system will search for the next index word which contains the string cot and display a list of those records. The user continues to enter a period at each list until the list of records with "Cotopaxi" in their name appears.

Building Cross-Reference Indexes
Normally, cross-reference indexes are built and maintained automatically by GSMODS. Each time a record is entered into the system, GSMODS adds the record to each of the appropriate indexes. If a record is deleted from the data entry screen or if the record is modified so that cross-reference fields are changed, the system will update the appropriate indexes so that cross-referencing will select the correct record(s). There are, however, several ways in which the cross-reference indexes can become corrupted relative to the databases. If data records are modified or deleted from Revelation Command Level (TCL), the cross-reference indexes will not be updated. If information is added to a database by any method other than entry from a GSMODS entry screen, the indexes will not be updated. Finally, if this version is being installed as an update to a previous version of GSMODS, data records which were entered prior to the update will not be indexed.
To re-build a cross-reference index which is incorrect for any reason, select choice number 5 from the Utilities Menu (the Utilities Menu is accessed by selecting choice number 9 from the Main Menu). This will start the cross-reference building program. The program will list the databases which can be crossreferenced in GSMODS and prompt for a selection. If one or more

48 Chapter 5

GSMODS 1.01

Changing Existing Information

database indexes are known to be incorrect, but not all of them, select one of the databases to re-build from the list. The program will then delete the current cross-reference index list for the selected database and re-build it from the data records. The process can be quite time-consuming if there are many records in the database. The program keeps a running list on the screen of its progress. When it finishes with the first database, it will prompt for another selection. Continue until all the known incorrect database indexes have been re-built. Return to the Utilities Menu by entering a q or Q at the database selection prompt.
To re-build all of the database indexes, press the RETURN key at the database selection prompt. The program will cycle through all of the databases on the list and then return to the Utilities Menu.

Record Counters
Several databases within the GSMODS system automatically provide a default record number for the next record to be added to the database (the Locality database, the Reference database, and the User-defined Symbol database). Occasionally, the default sequence number is not the number of the next available empty record. The numbers can become different either by the user creating a record and not entering any data into it, or by the user deleting one or more of the most recent records from the system (see p. 52). No difficulty is caused to the system by having unused record numbers; extra storage space is not consumed and extra time is not required to search or sort the database. However, the default record number can be easily reset to any value. To increase the default record number, intentionally leaving unused record numbers, enter the desired number in the record key field and proceed with the entry of the rest of the information for that record. To decrease the default record number, enter an = followed by the desired number in the record key field. For example, entering
=100
in the Record No. field of the Locality database will reset the default record number to 100. A space is not allowed between the = and the number.

Copying and Deleting Records
There are two Revelation commands, COPY and DELETE, which are useful for making changes to GSMODS databases. Revelation commands are used from Revelation Command Level (TCL). To get to TCL from the GSMODS system, first return to the Main Menu. Pressing the F9 function key from the Main Menu will place the system at Command level. The Revelation TCL prompt is .a colon. Any Revelation command can be entered from the colon prompt (see Appendix IV, Revelation Command Summaries). Cross-reference indexes will not be correct if database records are changed with Revelation commands such as COPY or DELETE. See Building crossreference indexes, p. 48, for instructions on how to re-build the indexes.
The COPY Command
The COPY command is used to duplicate a record within a database. It is entered from the Revelation Command Level colon prompt. The COPY command consists of the word COPY followed by the name of the database containing the record to copy, followed by the key of the record to copy, followed by the word TO:,
51 Chapter 5

GSMODS 1.01

Changing Existing Information

followed by the key to use for the new copy of the record. Each item or word in the command line must be separated from the previous item by a space. For example, the following command:
jCOPY MD.PLOT quadl TO: quad2
will duplicate the record with a key of quadl in the Plot Parameter database and give the new record a key of quad2. After this command, there will be two identical records in the Plot Parameter database with keys of quadl and quad2. This technique is useful for making a series of plot parameter records or report parameter records which only differ in a small number of fields. For example, if a series of plots is desired from a number of adjacent quadrangles using the same parameters for each plot, a series of plot parameter records could be created by entering all of the information for each plot from the keyboard at the Plot Parameter entry screen. The procedure could be improved by using the GSMODS default system so that the contents of each field in records after the first would not need to be re-typed; however, the user would still have to press the RETURN key for each field of each record. A faster method would be to create the first record on the data entry screen and then use the COPY command to make as many copies as desired. The user can then go back to the data entry screen and make the required changes to each new record, perhaps only changing the latitude and/or longitude limits and the notes for each record.

The DELETE Command
The DELETE command is used to erase records completely from the system. To delete a record, enter the word DELETE followed by the system name of the database which contains the record, followed by the key(s) of the record(s) to delete. Each item or word in the command line must be separated from the next item by a space. For example, the command:
JDELETE MD.DATA 25
will erase record number 25 from the Locality database.
CAUTION - Be sure that you want to permanently eliminate the record before deleting it; there is no un-delete facility in the Revelation system.
To delete more than one record in the same database, list all of the record keys on the same command line separated by spaces. The command:
jDELETE MD.PLOT quadl quad2 quads quad4
will erase four records from the Plot Parameter database. The DELETE command is most useful for erasing area outline records which have been incorrectly digitized. There is no entry screen for the Area Outline database (MD.AREA); information is entered

52 Chapter 5

GSMODS 1.01

Changing Existing Information

directly from the digitizing program. There are facilities in the digitizing program to correct errors, but at times it is easier to delete a record and start over. The records in the Area Outline database have the same key (Record No.) as the corresponding record in the Locality database. For more information about the DELETE command, refer to the Revelation User's Guide.

Changing Location Information
There are several methods of making changes to information which is entered from the digitizer. Individual records can be deleted from the Area Outline database (the drastic solution, see DELETE command, above). Single site locations can be corrected by re-digitizing the record. The new information will overwrite any older information in the Locality database. If a record number is entered while running the digitizing program and then the D (Delete) key on the digitizer keypad is pressed, the most recently entered line or area outline for that record will be deleted. To delete all of the lines or areas from a record, continue to enter the record number and the D key until the system informs you that there is no more data for that record. This allows you to re-digitize area outline information if an error has been made. See Chapter 4 for more information on running the digitizing program.

Modifying Locations in the Area Outline Database
CAUTION - The following technique is intended for experienced Revelation users only! Proceed at your own risk.
The Area Outline database is not intended to be accessed directly by the user; there is no data entry screen for MD.AREA. Access should be limited to the facilities provided in the digitizing system and to deleting records from Revelation command Level. However, if the user is familiar with either of the Revelation editors, EDIT or TEXT, minor changes can be made directly to records in the Area Outline database. Each record contains three fields, the record key (which is identical to the record key for the corresponding Locality database record), a multi-valued Latitude field, and a multi-valued Longitude field. Latitudes and longitudes are stored in decimal degrees. Each value in the Latitude field is paired with the same value number in the Longitude field to create a location pair. Do not add or delete a value from one field without also adding or deleting the corresponding value in the other field. Multiple lines in the same record are separated by a location with a latitude of 100° and a longitude of 0° which serves as a flag to the plotting program to mark the end of each line.

Chapter 6. GETTING INFORMATION OUT

Selection Criteria (Searching and Sorting)
The concept of selecting a certain records from a database and sorting them into a user-defined order before they are displayed or printed is used with most methods of getting information out of the GSMODS system. Several Revelation commands and the GSMODS reporting and plotting systems use selection criteria for searching and sorting. The general syntax of selection criteria will be discussed in this section, details which are specific to each command or field will be discussed in the appropriate section.
In general, selection criteria consist of WITH clauses and/or BY clauses. Any number of either type of clause may be included.

The WITH Clause

A WITH clause is used to select records to be printed or displayed. WITH clause syntax is:

WITH fieldname operator value

Each clause must begin with the word WITH and must contain one of the following operators:

EQ NE GT GE LT LE NOT CONTAINS
[] ] [

Equal Not equal Greater than Greater than or equal Less than Less than or equal Not (precedes other operators as a modifier) Selects record if string contains value as a sub-string
Same as CONTAINS Selects record if string begins with value Selects record if string ends with value

Fieldname is the name of one of the fields in the database being searched (see Appendices V through XII for complete lists of field names), and value is what the field is being compared with. If the value is not a number, it must be enclosed in single or double quotation marks. Field names and operators must be entered in uppercase. Clauses must be separated by the word AND or the word OR. For example, the following are all valid WITH clauses which could be used with the Locality database:

WITH COUNTY EQ 'Pueblo 1 WITH RECORD LT 10 WITH REC.TYPE EQ "SM" AND WITH COUNTY EQ "Hillside" WITH REC.TYPE [ 'M 1

55 Chapter 6

GSMODS 1.01

Getting Information Out

Selection is case sensitive; the first example above will only find records with Pueblo in the COUNTY field. Records with pueblo or PUEBLO in the COUNTY field would not be selected.
The BY Clause
The BY clause is used to sort the records before they are printed or displayed. The syntax of the BY clause is:
BY fieldname BY-DSND fieldname
where fieldname is a valid name of one of the fields of the database being searched (see Appendices V through XII for complete lists of field names). Field names must be entered in uppercase. The default sort is in ascending ASCII order. If a descending order sort is desired, BY-DSND can be substituted for BY. If more than one BY clause is included in the selection criteria, the first BY clause becomes the major sort definition. Each succeeding BY clause defines a successively more minor sort.
Creating GSMODS Reports
The GSMODS system provides considerable flexibility in the final appearance of tabular reports. This flexibility requires the user to make many choices for each type of report that is to be produced. To avoid the tedium of having to answer the same questions repeatedly each time another version or another copy of the same report is to be produced, the choices are all entered into a data entry screen. Each set of selections is named and saved so that the report can be reproduced at any time by rerunning the report program. In addition, similar reports can be easily generated by copying the selections from one report parameter record to another and then making whatever changes are necessary. Selection number 7 on the Main Menu brings up the first screen of the Report Parameter entry system (figure 11). The report generating program is run by entering selection 8 at the Main Menu.
Entering Report Parameters
There are several concepts which are used throughout the Report Parameter entry screen to allow maximum flexibility in the choice of style or type of report to be generated. These general concepts will be discussed before getting into the descriptions of fields within the Report Parameter entry system.

56 Chapter 6

GSMODS 1.01

| key | Syntax

There are several special character strings which can be included in any major or minor title, header, or footer description. These special strings are used to insert data from the system, data from the data file, or to insert long strings of identical characters (such as spaces or periods). All of these options are set off from the regular text by vertical bars, using the | character. The vertical bars and the included special character string are replaced by the information specified under each description below.

|fieldname|
+fieldname @fieldname
Note: PN DT Rn,x|

Replaced by the contents of the specified field from the current record. If |fieldname] occurs in the major section title, header, or footer, the current record is the record selected by the Major Title/Header Sel Criteria field or the Major Footer Selection Criteria field. If |fieldname| occurs in the minor section title, header, or footer, the current record is the current data record. Fieldname must be a defined dictionary field name in the Locality database (MD.DATA), and must be in uppercase letters.
Similar to |fieldname] except that the entire contents of the selected field is converted to uppercase.
Similar to |fieldname] except that fieldname must be a symbolic field defined in the dictionary of MD.DATA. See the Revelation Documentation for a description of symbolic fields (symbolic fields are not available to users of Run-Time versions of Revelation).
|+fieldname| and |@fieldname| can be combined as long as the + precedes the @. |+@fieldname| is acceptable, |@+fieldname| is not.
Replaced by the current page number. Replaced by the current system date in a mm/dd/yy
format. Replaced by the character x repeated n times.

Example: |R20, | (would be replaced by 20 spaces)

Page Repeating
Repeat fields are used to determine on which pages to print each line of the titles, headers, and footers of the report. Entry of an A or a in these fields causes the line to be printed on all pages of the report. Entry of an P or f in these fields causes the line to be printed on the first page of the report only. Entry of an L or 1 causes the line to be printed on the last page of the report only. If these fields are left blank, the line will be printed on all pages of the report.

57 Chapter 6

GSMODS 1.01

Line Formatting

Format fields are used to format individual lines or groups of lines of the report. If these fields are left blank, the line or lines will be left-justified in column 1.

Formatting Options are:

C Ln Rn ALn
ARn
Wn,m,i

Center the line or lines on the output page Left-justify the line or lines starting in column n Right-justify the line or lines n columns from the
right edge of the output page Alternately justify the line or lines n columns from
the left on odd numbered pages and n columns from the right on even numbered pages Alternately justify the line or lines n columns from the right on odd numbered pages and n columns from the left on even numbered pages Word-wrap the line or lines between columns n and m. Line breaks only occur at spaces between words. It is possible to concatenate values from multi-valued fields such that no spaces are included. The system sees the result as a single word. If a word is longer than the space allotted for a word-wrap column, the system will break the word at the right edge of the column, i specifies the number of spaces to indent the first line, i may be positive or negative. A positive i generates a normal paragraph indent. A negative i with an equal, but positive n generates a hanging indent paragraph (see Description column, figure 17, for an example with hanging indent paragraphs).

Examples:

L5 AR W5,80,-5
(Creates an 80 character per line paragraph with a 5 character hanging indent)

Separators
Separator fields contain a string which is used to control what is output after each report item. For example, the Title Separator controls what is output after the title and before the next portion of the report. Each character of the string is used to create a single output line. Each output line is the full width of the report output (see Char, per Line field). Each string character is repeated for an entire line. Thus, a string which consists of a single hyphen (-) will give a single line separator which consists of an entire line of - characters. Any character may be repeated for the entire line except a B or b. B and b are special characters which are used to generate a blank line. If this field is left blank, the system will output the next portion of the report on the line immediately following the

GSMODS 1.01

last line of the current item.

Examples: b b_b
*

(single blank line) (blank line, solid line [underscore], blank
line) (single line of *'s)

The Report Parameter Entry Screens
There are three data entry screens for Report Parameters (see figures 11, 13, and 15). Figures 12, 14, and 16 show completed Report Parameter entry screens which were used to produce a sample report (figure 17). Instructions for entering data into other system entry screens also apply to the report system (see Chapters 3 and 4). The special characters -, >, <, and ! all have the same meanings as in the Locality entry system. Help screens are available for each field by entering a ? or by pressing the Fl function key.

Report Parameter Screen #1
The first field on the first screen of the Report Parameter entry system is the Report Name field (figure 11). Entering an existing name displays the existing parameter information which can then be modified and stored again. Entering a new name creates a new Report Parameter record. The next field, Comments, is generally used for a more detailed description of the report being defined. This field has no effect on the creation of the report, but is useful for documenting the type of report and its use. The next seven fields on screen 1 of the Report Parameter entry system control the overall aspect of the report. Entering a number in the Max. Records field limits the output to the number of records given. This is useful for testing purposes. Once the report definition is satisfactory, clear this field so that the system will process all of the records in the Locality database. The Page Break w/i Record field controls whether the system will split a record between consecutive pages or force each record to be complete on a page. The Output Device field controls the destination of the completed report and the Char, per Line and Line per Page fields control the size of the output page. The Printer Init and Printer Reset fields are used to setup and reset the printer so that the appropriate font or type size is used for the report.
Most of the rest of the fields on the Report Parameter entry screens are used to enter various titles, head notes, and footers which are to appear on the report. Each entity (title, head note, etc.) has a field which describes the contents of the entity, a field which controls where it is repeated on the report, a field which controls the formatting of the entity, and a field which defines the separator which is to follow the entity in the report. The entities which are defined on the first screen can be repeated on each page of the report. The first of

these sets of linked multi-valued fields defines the title of the report. Each entry in the Title of Report field defines one line of the report title. As many lines of report title as desired may be entered. For each line entered, the system will prompt for which pages to print the title line on (Title Repeat field) and how to format the title line (Title Format field). When the report title is completed by leaving the Title of Report field blank, the system will prompt for the separator to use between the end of the title and the remainder of the report (Title Sep field). The system then prompts for similar information for the Head Note, Page Footer, and Column Header. The head note is slightly different from the title in that it is not a multivalued field. The entire head note is entered into the Head Note field at one time and the system formats it into a paragraph based on the contents of the Head Format field. The page footer section consists of linked multi-valued fields like the report title. The column header also consists of linked multi-valued fields, but does not include a format field. Each line of the column header should be formatted exactly as it should appear on the final report as it is entered into the Column Header field.
The last two fields on the first screen of the Report Parameter entry system are used to select and sort the records which are to be used to create the report. The Selection Criteria field selects the records to be used for the report. All of the options discussed in the section on Selection Criteria, p. 55, can be used in this field. However, use of a BY clause in this field is redundant and will only slow the processing of the report. Leaving this field blank will select all records in the Locality database.
The report can be divided into sections such as mining districts or counties. These sections are called "Major Sections" in this documentation to distinguish them from the individual records which are called "Minor Sections". In order to divide the data records into major sections, the selected records must be sorted by the field which is used to distinguish the major sections. The name of the field used to sort the Locality database records into major sections is entered into the Major Sort Field. After the sort field has been entered, the first screen Change prompt will appear. At this point, modifications can be made to the first screen, the record can be filed or deleted, or the user can proceed to the second screen by pressing the RETURN key.

Report Parameter Screen #2
When the second screen of the Report Parameter entry system appears, the report name from the first screen is automatically displayed as a reminder (figure 13). The next eleven fields on the second screen are used to define the title, header, and footer to be used for each major section of the report. These fields are similar to the equivalent fields from the first screen. There are no Repeat fields on this screen. The Major

Section Title and Major Section Header are repeated at the beginning of each major section of the report and the Major Section Footer is repeated at the end of each major section of the report. There are two fields which are used to enter selection criteria, Major Title/Header Sel Criteria and Major Footer Selection Criteria. These two fields are only used if the |fieldname| syntax (see |key| syntax, p. 57) is used with the major section title, header, or footer. If the |fieldname] syntax is used, the selection criteria fields are used to determine which record in each major section is to be used to extract the information which is to go into the title, header, or footer.
The next field on the second screen, Minor Sort Field, is used to define the sequence of records within each major section. Typically, records will be sorted by record number or site name, but any field in the Locality database may be used as a sort field. The rest of the fields on screen 2 are used to define the title and header to be used with each minor section (individual record). The Minor Title and Minor Header are repeated before each data record throughout the report. After the minor header separator field has been entered, the second screen Change prompt will appear. At this point, modifications can be made to the second screen, the record can be filed or deleted, the user can return to the first screen, or the user can proceed to the third screen by pressing the RETURN key.

Report Parameter Screen #3
When the third screen of the Report Parameter entry system appears, the report name from the first screen is automatically displayed as a reminder (figure 15). The next five fields form a linked multi-valued field set which are used to define the output of information from the individual data records. The Column Fieldnames field is used to list the fields from the data record which are to be used to create each column of the report. Normally, only one field name is used for each output column. However, fields can be combined in one column (LATITUDE and LONGITUDE, for example). For more information on combining fields in one column, see the description of Column Fieldnames in Appendix X or see the help screen at the Column Fieldnames prompt. The Start Char. No and Column Width fields are used to position each output column on the page and the Column Format field is used to format each column individually. The Multivalue Sel field is only used if the field being output is a multi-valued field. It is used to determine which values to output from the field and how to combine the values within the output column. These fields are followed by the linked multivalued fields which are used to define the footer which follows each data record on the report.
The final field, Print District Records, is used to determine whether summary (district or area) records (those with an A in the REC.TYPE field) are output as individual records.

Often, these records are used (as shown in the example discussed below) to provide the information for the major section title or header. Repeating the information as an individual record may not be desirable.

Report Example
As an example of one type of report which can be created with the reporting system, figure 17 shows a page from a table which lists several features of mines and prospects in the Butte 1° by 2° quadrangle, Montana. Data for this example are from a list of all the mines and prospects in the quadrangle by Elliott and others (1986). Figures 12, 14, and 16 show the Report Parameters which were used to create the sample report. Where multi-valued fields are used for the sample report parameters, only as many values as can be shown on the screen at one time are shown in the figures. For example, Column Fieldnames contains six values to produce the sample report (1 for each column) even though only the first value is shown on figure 16. There are many other styles of report which can be created using the reporting system and a little imagination.

The Report Program
Once the parameter record has been created, it is quite easy to create the report. To send the output to the printer, the printer must be attached to the computer and the System Setup database must be correctly configured for the printer in use (see Appendix II, Configuring GSMODS). Selecting choice number 8 from the Main Menu will bring up the program which generates the report. The program will display a menu of existing parameter records and prompt for a selection from the list. The selection may be made either by entering the number of the desired report from the list, or by entering the name of the parameter record directly. If an P or an f was entered into the Output Device field of the selected parameter record, the program will prompt for the name of the output file. Enter a standard DOS file name or path name and be sure the disk is available and has enough empty space to contain the output file. The program displays the page number and major section number that is being processed as it proceeds. Because the system must sort all of the selected records by the major sort field and the minor sort field, there are delays in the data output. This is a normal part of the procedure. When the report is finished, the system returns to the Main Menu.
Entering an ! at any prompt during the reporting program will restart the program from the beginning. Entering a q or Q at any prompt will terminate the program and return control to the Main Menu.

Creating Terminal Command Level (TCL) reports
At the bottom of the GSMODS Main Menu screen, there is a note that F9 will end the menu. In order to search the database or output special types of tabular information, you must exit the GSMODS menu system. Pressing the P9 function key from the Main Menu takes the user to Revelation Terminal Command Level (TCL). The TCL prompt is a _L. From the _L prompt any Revelation command may be entered. To return to the GSMODS Main Menu, enter mods or MODS at the _L prompt. There are four commands that are of particular interest in the output of special types of tabular information: LIST, FORM, SELECT, and PDISK. These commands will be briefly explained in the following sections. More information about these and other Revelation commands can be found in the Revelation documentation if you have purchased the full system. If you have purchased the Run-time system, you will not have Revelation documentation other than what is given here and in Appendix IV, Revelation Command Summaries.

The LIST Command

The LIST command is used to produce simple columnar listings either on the display screen or on the printer (figure 18). The syntax of the command is:

jLIST {n} filename {selection criteria} fieldlist {options}

n in the command above is an optional limit to the number of records to list. It must be an integer and is most useful for testing the LIST command with a small number of records before creating a large output listing.

Acceptable file names in the GSMODS system are:

MD.DATA MD.REF MD.USER MD.PLOT MD.SYM MD.REPORT MD.AREA MD.SYS

Locality information Reference information Reporter information Plot parameter information User-defined symbol information Report parameter information Location outline information System configuration information

Selection criteria consist of an optional phrase or phrases which define the search and sort operations to be performed on the data records before they are listed. They are described in the section on Selection Criteria, p. 55. Any valid selection criteria may be used with the LIST command.

Fieldlist is a list of field names to be included in the output list. These must be valid field names for the database being searched (see Appendices V through XII for complete lists of field names), and must be entered in the order in which they are to be output. Field names used in the selection criteria do not need to be output, and will not be unless they are also included in the list of field names.

There are several useful options which can be appended to the end of the LIST command. The first is the (N) option. Normally, when the output goes to the display the system stops at the end of each page. The (N) option causes the output to scroll continuously without stopping. Second is the (P) option. Normally, the output of a LIST command is sent to the display. The (P) option sends the output of the LIST command to the printer. See the section on the PDISK command (p. 76) for a technique used to send output to a disk file. The Revelation system has an unusual method of handling form feeds on the printer. At the end of each output to the printer, the paper is
left near the bottom of the last page. When the next list is sent to the printer, it is preceded by a form feed to place the paper at the top of the next page. If the printer has been placed at the top of a page in the beginning, the initial form feed wastes a sheet of paper before starting to print. To avoid this paper eject at the beginning of the listing, use the (E)

option which suppresses page ejection. The preceding options are always enclosed in parentheses. More than one option can be included. There are two other useful options which are not enclosed in parentheses. The LIST command default is to single space the output. If double spaced output is desired, add the DBL-SPC option to the command. Finally, by default the system will output the record number as the first column. If the record number is not desired in the first column, then append ID-SUPP to the end of the command. A complete LIST command might look something like the following:
jLIST MD.DATA WITH COUNTY EQ 'Adams' BY SITE SITE DEP.TYPE ID-SUPP (PE)
The entire command must be in capital letters except for values within quotes which must be exactly as they are in the data record. Many more options for the LIST command can be found in the Revelation documentation including creation of special headers and footers and various types of totals and sub-totals.

The FORM Command
The FORM command can be used to define simple output formats that are to be used repeatedly. The FORM command is simpler than the reporting facility that is included with GSMODS, but does not have as much flexibility and does not always work correctly with multi-valued fields. There are three pre-defined formats which have been included with GSMODS. The three formats, called REF, REFNUM, and DUMP, are stored in the FORMS database. The REF format prints a reference list in standard USGS format from the Reference database (figure 19). The REFNUM format prints the same reference list with the addition of the reference number (figs. 20 and 21). This allows the user to produce a crossreference list of references and reference numbers that have been entered into the system. The DUMP format is used with the Locality database to produce a list of everything that is in the database for the selected records (figure 22). To create other form definitions, see the Revelation documentation on the FORM command. Normally, a SELECT command is given before each FORM command (see following section). The syntax of the FORM command is:
_:FORM FORMS format filename
where FORMS is the name of the database where the formats are stored, format is one of the format names, such as REFNUM, and filename is either MD.DATA or MD.REF depending on which format is being used. Be sure the printer is turned on before running the FORM command. The following is an example of a complete FORM command:
_:FORM FORMS REFNUM MD.REF

The SELECT Command
Because the FORM command does not provide a method of sorting or selecting the records before printing, the SELECT command must be used. If the FORM command is run as shown above, all the records in the Reference database will be printed in the order in which they are stored in the database. This is not the order in which the records were entered; nor is it record number order. Generally, this order is not of any use to the user. Therefore, the normal procedure is to run a SELECT command immediately preceding the FORM command. The syntax of the SELECT command is:
jSELECT filename {selection criteria}
where the file name is the same as the file name to be used in the FORM command, and the selection criteria are formatted as described in the Selection Criteria section, p. 55. Any valid selection criteria may be used with the SELECT command. To produce a list of references in alphabetic order by author (figure 20), the following sequence would be used:
:SELECT MD.REF BY AUTH.NAME _>FORM FORMS REF MD.REF
When the SELECT command is finished, Revelation will prompt for the next command with a > prompt. The > prompt indicates that Revelation has created a selection list from the database and is waiting for a command which uses the selection list. The FORM command must immediately follow the SELECT command. To produce a list of references with reference numbers in reference number order for cross-reference use while entering data records (figure 21), the following sequence would be used:
:SELECT MD.REF BY REC.NO >FORM FORMS REFNUM MD.REF

The PDISK Command
PDISK is a Revelation facility which can be used to send any report to a disk file (in ASCII format) instead of to the printer. It is a simple data re-direction command. Invoking PDISK changes the destination of all information that would normally be sent to the printer. The syntax of the PDISK command is:
jPDISK pathname
Where pathname is any path name which is acceptable to DOS. For example,
JPDISK A:TEMP.OUT
would send all subsequent printer files to a file named TEMP.OUT

76 Chapter 6

GSMODS 1.01

on the A: disk. Redirection remains in effect until another PDISK command is issued or the user logs off the Revelation system. To re-direct printer files back to the printer, the following command is used:
jPDISK PRN
Creating Maps and Overlays

GSMODS includes a plotting facility for the production of mineral occurrence maps and overlays. Output from this facility is directed to a pen plotter (Hewlett-Packard or equivalent) attached to one of the computer's serial communications ports. There is currently no facility for plotting localities on the computer screen or on a printer. A variety of symbols and line types are available for plotting individual site localities and lines which have been digitized (see Chapter 4, Entering location information from the digitizer).

The Plot Parameter Entry Screen
The GSMODS system provides considerable flexibility in the final appearance of the plot. This flexibility requires the user to make many choices for each plot that is to be produced. To avoid the tedium of having to answer the same questions repeatedly each time another version or another copy of the same plot is to be produced, the choices are all entered into a data entry screen. Each set of selections is named and saved so that the plot can be reproduced at any time just by re-running the plot program. In addition, similar plots can be easily generated by copying the selections from one Plot Parameter entry screen to another and then making whatever changes are necessary. Selection number 5 on the Main Menu brings up the Plot Parameter entry screen (figure 23). Figure 24 shows a completed Plot Parameter entry screen which was used to produce the sample plots described in the Plot Program section, p. 81.
Plot Name is the first field on the Plot Parameter entry screen. Entering an existing name displays the existing parameter information which can then be modified and stored again. Entering a new name creates a new plot parameter record. The next four fields define the boundaries of the area to be plotted. Enter latitudes in the following format: dd mm ss N or dd mm ss S, and longitudes in the following format: ddd mm ss E or ddd mm ss W. The next two fields determine the scale of the plot. The N-S and E-W scales do not need to be the same. This is helpful when trying to match a plot to a base map. Base maps, even scale-stable maps, are rarely exactly to scale in both directions. The next field determines which direction will be north on the paper. If no rotation is selected, by entering an N, the X-axis (east-west) will lie along the length of the paper. If the plot is rotated, by entering a Y, the X-axis will lie along the width of the paper.

Fields 9 through 12 determine the spacing and size of tick marks to plot. If no tick marks are desired, leave field 9 blank; the system will then skip the remaining tick mark fields. If tick marks are desired, enter the intervals desired in fields 9 and 10. Tick intervals are entered with the following format: dd nun ss. The intervals do not need to be the same. Tick marks will always be plotted at even intervals calculated from 0° latitude and longitude, regardless of whether the border of the map lies at an even interval. For example, if the N-S borders of the map are at 38° 15' and 39° 15', and if a N-S tick interval of 30' is specified, tick marks will be plotted at 38° 30' and 39° 00' only. Field 11 specifies the size of the tick marks in inches. If a positive number is entered (0.1 for example) tick marks will be plotted throughout the map; if a negative number is entered (-0.1 for example) tick marks will only be plotted along the borders of the map. Finally, field 12 specifies the number of the pen to be used to plot the tick marks. The pen number is the number of the pen stall on the plotter. If a 1 is entered, the pen in stall #1 on the plotter will be used. After the pen number is entered, the system will return to field 9 to ask for a second set of tick marks. As many sets of ticks marks as desired may be entered. Tick mark entry may be terminated by pressing the RETURN key at field 9.
The next two fields specify the amount to offset the plot on the paper in the X and Y directions. Enter the distance, in inches, that the boundary of the plot should be from the left edge (X) and bottom (Y) of the plot paper. Most plotters will not allow plotting closer than about 0.4-0.8 inches from the edge of the paper. If a number is entered that is smaller than the minimum for the plotter (or the field is left blank), the program will substitute the minimum for the plotter in use.
The remainder of the entry screen is divided into three sections, labeled Symbols, Labels, and Lines. Each section is used to define sets of similar items. Each section is composed of linked multi-valued fields. That is, the system will store definitions for as many symbols or labels or lines as the user would like to enter. Each time an entry is made in field 15 (Symbol Code), for example, the system cycles through the rest of the Symbol fields, 16-18, and back to 15. Only when field 15 is left blank will the system go on to the section on Labels. Other similarities in the three sections include a field in each section for selecting the pen number to use to plot the item being defined, and a field called Sel. Criteria. The Selection Criteria field is used to select which records from the database are to be used to create the symbol or label or line being defined. For example, if a plot is desired which displays each mine in the map area using a symbol which depends on the commodity being mined, the selection criteria for the first symbol might be:
WITH SITE.TYPE EQ "M" AND WITH COMMODITIES EQ "Pb"

79 Chapter 6

GSMODS 1.01

Getting Information Out

The terms SITE.TYPE and COMMODITIES are field names in the Locality (MD.DATA) database. A list of all the field names in the Locality database is included in Appendix V, Locality Database. Selection criteria are described in the Selection Criteria section, p. 55. Any valid selection criteria may be entered in these fields, although entering a BY clause will only slow the plot program; it will have no effect on the final plot.

Plot Symbols
Each entry in the Symbol section of the Plot Parameter entry screen is used to plot a single symbol at the location specified by the latitude/longitude pair in each of the selected Locality records. In addition to selection criteria and pen number, the Symbol section has fields to select the Symbol Code and the Symbol Height. To see the current list of symbols, enter a ? or press the Fl key in the Symbol Code field. In addition to the symbols which are included with the system, a facility has been included for User-defined symbols. If you don't like the symbols included with the system, you can design your ownl The techniques for creating User-defined symbols are described in the User-Defined Symbols section (p. 86). The symbol height is entered in inches. Because a separate symbol height is entered for each symbol defined, it is possible to define an entire set of symbols which differ only in size. Also, don't overlook the possibility of combining symbols to form new symbols. If more than one symbol code or size is entered using the same selection criteria, the symbols will overprint one another.

Plot Labels
The Labels section of the data entry screen is used to add labels to data locations that have been selected within the Symbols section. The records need not have been selected in the Symbol section, but because labels are always offset from the location of the symbol, the label alone will not represent the true location of the data record. The Labels section includes several unique fields. Field 19 (Post Field) selects the Locality record field from which the label information is obtained. The name of the field must be entered as it is shown on the list of field names for the Locality database (see Appendix V, Locality Database). The field name may be followed by two parameters in parentheses. For example, KEY(2,5). The first parameter is only included if the field to be posted is a multi-valued field. It is used to select which value of a multivalued field is to be posted. If the first parameter is omitted, the first value will be posted for a multi-valued field. The second parameter indicates the maximum number of characters to post for each record. All selected values will be truncated at this length. If the second parameter is omitted, the system will post up to six characters. For each record that is selected by the selection criteria field, the system will extract the appropriate number of characters from the selected value of the

80 Chapter 6

GSMODS 1.01

Post Field and plot those characters to the right of the site location. For each set of Labels, the user must also specify the Character Height and Character Width, in inches.

Plot Lines
The final section of the entry screen, the Lines section, is used to plot lines from the data set. The lines may be area outlines, map boundaries, or any other lines which have been digitized into the Area Outline database. Dummy records can be created just for the purpose of entering line data to appear on the plot. This is the technique used to plot geologic contacts, faults, etc. See the section on Digitizing, Chapter 4. The only special field in the Line section is field 24, Line Type Code. This code is used to specify the type of line to plot, solid, dashed, dotted, etc. Enter a ? or press the PI key in field 24 to see the current list of acceptable codes. There is a special case for the Selection Criteria field of the Lines section. Entry of the keyword BOUNDARY in the Selection Criteria field will draw a line of the type defined in field 24 around the boundary of the map as defined by the latitude/longitude limits.
Finally, there is a text field at the bottom of the screen that can be used for notes. This field has no effect on the plot, but is a useful place to enter a description of the plot so that subsequent users will not have to puzzle out the plot definition.
As in the rest of the data entry system, there are special characters which can be entered into any field of the Plot Parameter entry screen. Entering a hyphen (-) will terminate automatic defaulting in any field. Entering an ! at any field will terminate the data entry for that parameter screen, store the record, and return with an empty screen for another plot.

The Plot Program
Once the plot parameter record has been created, the plot is generated by running the plot program. The plotter must be attached to a serial port. The plotter configuration must be consistent with the selections in the configuration file (see Appendix III, Hardware Installation and Configuration, and Appendix II, Configuring GSMODS). Selecting choice number 6 from the Main Menu will start the plot program. The program will display a menu of the existing Plot Parameter records and prompt for a selection from the list. The selection may be made by either entering the number of the desired plot from the list, or by entering the name of the parameter record directly. The program will then ask if the plotter is turned on. Check that the plotter is on, that there are pens in the stalls that are to be used, and that the paper is loaded before responding with a RETURN. There will be a short delay (approximately 15 sec.) while the system checks and clears the communications line, and

81 Chapter 6

GSMODS 1.01

then the plot will begin. The program displays the portion of the plot that is being processed as it proceeds. Because the system must search every record in the database for each selection that is included in the parameter record, there are often delays in the plotting while the program is searching and collecting information for the next series of symbols or lines. This is a normal part of the procedure. When the plot is finished, the program asks if another plot is desired. If the prompt is answered with a "Y" or "y" the list of choices is redisplayed; otherwise, the system returns to the Main Menu.
Entering an ! at any prompt during the plot program will restart the program from the beginning. Entering a q or Q at any prompt will terminate the program and return control to the Main Menu.

Combining GSMODS with GSMAP and GSDRAW
The plotting program provides a complete system for plotting the locations of data records using a variety of symbols, for labeling those locations using information from each data record, and for plotting various types of lines which have been digitized into the database system. It does not provide facilities for adding titles, geologic symbols, text which is not associated with a data location, or explanatory information. All of these capabilities and more are available in GSMAP and GSDRAW (Seiner, Taylor, and Johnson, 1986), a set of graphics programs which use the same hardware as GSMODS. Figures 25 and 26 show some of the capabilities of the combination of GSMODS and GSDRAW. Figure 25 was created by plotting information from a small test file using the set of parameters shown in figure 24. The plot demonstrates a few of the system-defined symbols, labeling of the locations with the record number, drawing a mining district outline, and drawing a latitude/longitude boundary with tick marks. Figure 26 shows the same plot with the addition of labels and title from a GSDRAW file (GSMAP could also have been used). The technique for matching the overlay to the original plot involves four steps:
1. Enter data record information into GSMODS in the normal manner. Digitize all of the information necessary for the original plot using the GSMODS digitizing facility. Create the GSMODS portion of the plot in its final form using the plot program.
2. Use the plot from GSMODS as a base for digitizing the rest of the information using either GSMAP or GSDRAW. If a small illustration (one that will fit on the digitizer in one piece) which will not contain information from other base maps is being created, GSDRAW is easier to use. If the illustration must be digitized in several pieces, or if information must be added from other base maps, GSMAP is the better choice.

82 Chapter 6

3. Plot the two illustrations on the same piece of paper by running the two programs (GSMODS and either GSMAP or GSDRAW) successively without unloading the paper from the plotter.
4. Adjust the X and Y offsets in either program to match the overlay exactly to the base. As long as the paper is not unloaded from the plotter between the two plots, the registration will remain the same for every plot.

User-Defined Symbols
To provide increased flexibility for the plotting facility within GSMODS, a system for creating user-defined symbols has been included. The user should become familiar with the plotting system using the symbols included with GSMODS before attempting to define new symbols. Also, the user should become familiar with the Hewlett-Packard Graphics Language (HPGL) before proceeding. No attempt is made here to explain the syntax and parameters of HPGL commands; the commands are fully explained in the "Interfacing and Programming Manual" which comes with the Hewlett-Packard plotter. The following HPGL commands can be used with the user-defined symbol facility:
AR - Arc CI - Circle ER - Edge Rectangle EW - Edge Wedge PD - Pen-down PU - Pen-up PM - Polygon mode SP - Select Pen
A symbol definition begins by assuming that the plotter pen is at the location of the center of the symbol and that the pen is up. The general procedure is to move to the beginning of a line segment with a pen-up command and then to draw a line segment or figure with one of the other commands listed above. A pen-up command is not necessary at the end of the symbol definition. Pen-up and pen-down commands are followed by X and Y coordinates. Other commands are followed by other parameters such as circle radius, etc. All coordinates and distances are entered as a factor to be multiplied by the height of the symbol as defined in the Plot Parameter record. Therefore, all userdefined symbols can be plotted at any size.
There are two types of lines which can be used to make up each symbol, simple lines and polygonal lines. Simple lines are used to draw all parts of the symbol which are never to be filled with a solid shading. All of the HPGL commands listed above except the PM command can be used to construct simple lines. Polygonal lines are used for parts of the symbol which should be shaded if a filled symbol is selected on the Plot Parameter entry screen. The ER, EW, and SP commands are ignored within polygonal lines if a filled symbol is being drawn. If a filled symbol is not selected, then the polygonal lines portion of the symbol will be drawn as simple lines.

Example
A brief example may be of use in understanding the concept. In order to define, or edit the definition of, a user-defined symbol, select item number 9 (Utilities) from the GSMODS Main Menu. From the Utilities Menu, select item number 2 (User-

86 Chapter 6

GSMODS 1.01

Getting Information Out

defined Symbols) to bring up the User-defined Symbol entry screen. The screen will appear as in figure 27. The cursor will be in the Symbol No. field. Symbol numbers 1 through 99 are reserved for system defined symbols (No, the system does not include 99 symbols at this time; but the hope is that some of the users will send symbol definitions to the author which could be included in the next release). Symbol numbers 100 through 999 are reserved for user-defined symbols. Selecting any symbol number from 1 to 999 on the plot parameter record will plot the unfilled version of that symbol if the symbol has been defined. Adding an F to the beginning of any symbol number will plot the filled equivalent of the symbol. Thus, symbol number Fl is the filled equivalent of symbol number 1, symbol number F100 is the filled equivalent of symbol number 100, etc.
The example has been stored in symbol number 100. Enter 100 in the Symbol No. field and the example symbol definition will appear on the screen as in figure 28. This definition plots a circle with one quadrant filled. The Symbol Name field and the Notes field are for the user's convenience. Neither of them have any effect on the plotting of the symbol. All of the action occurs in the two fields, Simple Lines and Poly. Lines. This is where the simple lines and polygonal lines are defined for each symbol.
In this example, there is only one command in the Simple Lines field. This entry is used to draw the outer circle with a radius of 0.5 times the symbol height and a chord tolerance of 20 degrees. Commands are separated by semi-colons; parameters within commands are separated by commas. Because the definition of the circle is made in the Simple Lines field, the circle will not be filled even if a filled symbol is selected.
There are three commands in the Poly. Lines field. Commands are separated by semi-colons; parameters within commands are separated by commas. The first command (PD) draws a straight line from the center of the circle (circles always leave the pen where it started) to the edge (0.5 units in Y) at 0 degrees. The second command (AR) draws an arc 90 degrees clockwise along the circle; and the third command (PD) draws a straight line from the edge of the circle at 90 degrees back to the center (-0.5 units in X). The three commands taken together form a complete polygon. This is a requirement for all entries into the Poly. Lines field! The set of commands entered in the Poly. Lines field must form one or more closed polygons. If symbol number 100 is selected in a Plot Parameter record, a circle with the first quadrant outlined will be plotted. If symbol number F100 is selected, a circle with the first quadrant filled will be plotted. Change any of the fields by entering the number of the field to change at the Change prompt. Store the symbol by pressing the RETURN key at the Change prompt.

Sub-polygons
The PM command can be used to form sub-polygons within each of the polygons constructed in the Poly. Lines field. The PM command has three forms: PM,0 is used to start collecting points for a polygon, PM,1 is used to break between sub-polygons, and PM,2 is used to terminate the polygon. An initial PM,0 and a terminating PM,2 are automatically added to the commands in the Poly. Lines field. If one or more sub-polygons are desired, the PM,1 command must be included by the user. For example, the following command string will form a filled square with a square hole in the center:
Simple Line: PU,O.5,O.5 Poly. Line:
PD,0,-1,-1,0,0,1,1,0;PM,1;PU,-0.2,-0.2;PD,0,-0.6,-0.6,0,0,0.6,0.6,0
The simple line is used to move the pen to the edge of the polygon before the polygon definition is started. If this is not done, the plotter will draw a line from the center of the square to the beginning corner. The PM command is used to separate the definition of the exterior polygon from the interior sub-polygon. Additional sub-polygons can be constructed by separating each with the PM command. The plotter fills alternate sub-polygons starting with the exterior polygon.
As a test of your understanding of the system, define the symbols equivalent to number 100 with the other 3 quadrants filled. Then try a square or diamond with filled quadrants. When you think you've got it down, try a hexagon with filled sectors. And finally, the author would certainly appreciate it if some ambitious soul would define a "pick and hammer" prospect symbol and donate it to the system.
When you tire of the game, entering END in the Symbol No. field will return control to the Utilities Menu. Press the F9 function key at the Utilities Menu to return to the Main Menu.

Chapter 7. ARCHIVING AND RESTORING INFORMATION
Because collecting and entering data into the database system is often the most time-consuming and expensive part of a resource assessment project, every effort should be made to protect the information once it is in digital form. GSMODS includes several forms of protection which should be adequate to avoid accidental destruction of information. No attempt has been made to provide system security against intentional destruction of, or un-authorized access to, the databases. The final line of defense against accidental destruction of information consists of multiple copies of the databases. Databases should be backed up (archival copies made) regularly and often. The back-up copy (or copies if you really want to be safe) should be stored in a separate location from the primary data. Choices 3 and 4 on the Utilities Menu (Back-up Data Files and Restore Data Files) are used to make a copy of the user's databases on a separate disk from the primary databases, and to restore the primary data from the back-up copy if necessary.

Creating a Back-up Copy of the Databases

Choice number 3 from the Utilities Menu runs the back-up program which copies the current account databases to the disk(s) selected by the user. This program deletes existing databases on the back-up disk before copying the data from the current account to the back-up disk. Be sure there are no files on the back-up disk that should be saved before starting the program. The following databases and utility files are copied from the current account to the back-up disk:

MD.DATA MD.REF MD.AREA MD.USER FORMS

MD.PLOT MD.SYM MD.REPORT MD.SYS MD.DATA.XR

MD.REF.XR MD.USER.XR MD.PLOT.XR MD.SYM.XR MD.REPORT.XR

When the back-up program is started, the screen clears and the program prompts for the location of the Revelation system. Enter the complete DOS path name to the Revelation system currently in use. This path name is used by the program to search for the files to copy. If an incorrect path name is given, the program will print an error message when it attempts to copy the files. The default for the Revelation system location is

C:\REV

indicating that the system resides on the C: drive in a subdirectory named REV. The program next prompts for the location of the back-up disk. Enter the complete DOS path name to the location where the back-up is to be created. The default is

A:

91 Chapter 7

GSMODS 1.01

Archiving and Restoring

indicating that the A: drive is to be used for the back-up disk(s). If the back-up is to be made to a high-capacity device such as a removable-cartridge hard disk, a path name to a subdirectory may be entered. If a sub-directory is used, make certain there is enough unused space on the disk to complete the back-up procedure. If a complete disk is used, such as A:, the program will prompt for a new disk if the first disk fills.
After the locations are entered, the program will wait for the user to insert a formatted back-up disk into the selected drive and press the RETURN key. If no errors occur, the program will inform the user that it is deleting old back-up files (if there were any on the back-up disk) and then notify the user that it is copying databases from the current account to the back-up disk. If the back-up disk becomes full, the program will pause and request another disk in the back-up disk drive. Insert another formatted disk and press the RETURN key to continue. If the back-up program finds an empty database it will display a warning message. This is a normal occurrence when backing up a new account. If this message appears after the account has been in use long enough that none of the databases should be empty, quit the back-up program (enter a Q or q) and find the problem before proceeding. This is a remote possibility, but illustrates the reason for maintaining more than one back-up data set. Running the restore program will be easier if a note is made of empty databases when the back-up is made. Errors which may occur are generally related to the program being unable to find the files at the location given by the user. If the program stops with an error message, the safest procedure is to quit the program by entering a q or Q and check that the path names being used are correct before trying again.
After the program has copied all of the databases, it returns to the current account and checks each database for an overflow condition. If it finds an overflow, it will notify the user and ask if the database should be restructured. Overflow is a normal occurrence when information is being added to the databases. Each database is initially created to hold 65,535 characters (64K bytes) of information. When the information in a database exceeds 64K bytes, an overflow file is created for the remaining data. Having to search for data in an overflow file slows the system slightly. Therefore, the user should answer YES to the restructure query to allow the back-up program to restructure the file. Restructuring causes Revelation to allocate another 64K bytes of storage space for the database and clears the overflow condition.

Restoring Databases from the Back-up Copy
Choice number 4 from the Utilities Menu runs the restore program which copies one or more databases from the back-up disk(s) to the current account.

92 Chapter 7

GSMODS 1.01

Archiving and Restoring

CAUTION - This program deletes the databases on the current account after copying the equivalent databases from the back-up disk; so, be sure the current account file(s) are not needed before starting the program.

The procedure that the restore program uses for each database is to rename the existing database by adding a ".TEMP" extension to the database name (e.g. MD.DATA.TEMP), then to copy the back-up database to the current account, and finally to delete the old database. If the program is interrupted before the process is complete, the original database can be restored by renaming the ".TEMP" database back to the original name. The following databases and utility files may be copied from the back-up disk to the current account:

MD.DATA MD.REF MD.AREA MD.USER FORMS

MD.PLOT MD.SYM MD.REPORT MD.SYS MD.DATA.XR

MD.REF.XR MD.USER.XR MD.PLOT.XR MD.SYM.XR MD.REPORT.XR

When the Restore program is started, the screen clears and the program issues a warning concerning the destruction of current databases. Enter a "Y" or "y" to continue. The program then prompts for the location of the Revelation system. Enter the complete DOS path name to the Revelation system currently in use. This path name is used by the program to search for the current account. If an incorrect path name is given, the program will print an error message when it attempts to copy the files. The default for the Revelation system location is

C:\REV

indicating that the system resides on the C: drive in a subdirectory named REV. The program next prompts for the location of the back-up disk. Enter the complete DOS path name to the back-up disk location. The default is

A:

indicating that the A: drive is to be used for the back-up disk(s). A complete DOS path name to a sub-directory may be entered. If the back-up is contained on more than one disk, the program will prompt for a new disk after it has copied the required files from the first disk.

After the paths are entered, the program will inquire if the user wants to restore all of the files from the back-up disk(s). If the answer is YES (y or Y), the program will proceed to restore all the files that are on each of the back-up disks. If the answer is NO (n or N), the program will pause before restoring each file and ask if the file should be restored. This allows the user to restore selected files, if desired. The user can quit the program at any time by entering a q or Q at the file restore prompt. The program waits for the user to insert the

93 Chapter 7

GSMODS 1.01

Archiving and Restoring

first back-up disk into the drive and press the RETURN key. If no errors occur, the program will inform the user as it copies each database from the back-up disk to the current account. If another back-up disk is required, the program will pause and request another disk in the back-up disk drive. Insert the next back-up disk and press the RETURN key to continue. Errors which may occur are generally related to the program being unable to find the files at the location given by the user. If an error message occurs, the safest procedure is to quit the program by entering a q or Q and check that the path names being used are correct before trying again.
If the restore program is unable to find a database on the current back-up disk, it will ask the user whether to search for it on the next back-up disk or to skip the database. This is where it is helpful to have a list of databases which were empty when the back-up was created. The normal response is to press the RETURN key so that the program will search the next disk. However, if the database does not exist on any of the back-up disks, the user must tell the program to skip (enter an "S") the database. If not told to skip the database, the program will continue to prompt for another disk to search. Be sure that the back-up disks are inserted in the back-up drive in the same order that they were created by the back-up program. If back-up disk #2 is inserted before disk #1, the program will halt with a "Database MD.DATA NOT found on disk 1" error message. Quit the program (enter a Q or a q), place the correct disk in the back-up drive, and restart the program to continue.

Transferring Data Between Accounts
Because the two programs, back-up and restore, have no knowledge of the account in use, they can also be used to transfer data from one account to another. For example, to create a new account with information which is a subset of a current account:
1. Create the new account with empty databases using the installation procedure. See Appendix I, Installation of GSMODS.
2. LOGTO the old account which contains the information and run the back-up program. This will create a disk or set of disks which contain all of the information in the old account databases.
3. LOGTO the new account and run the restore program. From the restore program, the desired databases can be copied to the new account.
4. From the new account Main Menu, press the P9 function key to access Revelation Command Level (TCL). From TCL, the Revelation SELECT and DELETE commands can be used to erase records in each database which are not needed in the new account.
5. Build a set of cross-reference indexes for the new account (see Chapters, Building cross-reference indexes).

As an example, the following sequence of commands could be used to create a county (Elbert) subset of a database containing records for an entire state (Colorado).

Line Formatting

The following are valid entries for all formatting fields:

C Ln Rn ALn
ARn
Wn,m,i

Center the line or lines on the output page Left-justify the line or lines starting in column n Right-justify the line or lines n columns from the
right edge of the output page Alternately justify the line or lines n columns from
the left on odd numbered pages and n columns from the right on even numbered pages Alternately justify the line or lines n columns from the right on odd numbered pages and n columns from the left on even numbered pages Word-wrap the line or lines between columns n and m. Line breaks only occur at spaces between words. It is possible to concatenate values from multi-valued fields such that no spaces are included. The system sees the result as a single word. If a word is longer than the space allotted for a word-wrap column, the system will break the word at the right edge of the column, i specifies the number of spaces to indent the first line, i may be positive or negative. A positive i generates a normal paragraph indent. A negative i with an equal, but positive n generates a hanging indent paragraph.

Examples:

L5 AR W5,80,-5
(Creates an 80 character per line paragraph with a 5 character hanging indent)

Column Format Codes

Multi-value Selection Codes
Concatenate, the most general option, is entered as follows:
Cn,m,x
The C is required to specify the concatenation option. The n is an integer which specifies the starting value to select for output from the multi-valued field. The m is an integer which specifies the last value to be output from the multi-valued field. The x is a character string which is to be inserted between each value.
The N option is a special case of concatenation. It is used when each value is to be output on a separate line. The format is:
Nn,m
The N tells the system to use a new line for each value. The n is an integer which specifies the starting value to select for output from the multi-valued field. The m is an integer which specifies the last value to be output from the multi-valued field.

Installation

Appendix I. INSTALLATION OF REVELATION AND GSMODS
Before the GSMODS system can be installed, the Revelation database management system installation must be completed. If a complete Revelation system is being installed, follow the instructions which come with the Revelation documentation. If a Revelation Run-time system is being installed, there will be little or no documentation with the system. The Run-time system can be installed by simply copying all of the files on the Revelation distribution disk to a sub-directory on the hard disk. Although Revelation can be run on a computer with two 36OK byte floppy disk drives, the combination of Revelation and GSMODS is too large and must be run from a high-capacity disk such as a hard disk or removable-cartridge disk system.
If a previous version of GSMODS has been in use and the information in the system is to be transferred to the new version, first make a back-up copy of the entire old system in case an error is made in the installation procedure, then follow the procedure below just as if it was a first-time installation. Be sure to use the same account name that was used with the earlier version. The installation program will update the GSMODS system to the new version, but will not destroy any of the existing data.
Once the Revelation system is installed and operating correctly (try some of the Revelation tutorials both to test the system installation and to become familiar with the Revelation environment), GSMODS can be installed by the following sequence:
1. Back-up the GSMODS distribution disks. This is important because the distribution disks are used each time a new account is created (see the section on multiple accounts, p. 116). Floppy disks do fail. Don't rely on a single copy any longer than necessary.
2. Put the GSMODS distribution disk #1 in the A: drive 3. Make the drive with the installed Revelation system the
default drive and change directory to the Revelation subdirectory. On most systems this would be accomplished by entering the drive identifier at the DOS prompt (c; if Revelation is installed on the C: drive) and then the Change Directory command (cd \rev if REV is the name of the Revelation sub-directory). There must be at least 500K bytes of space available on the disk after the Revelation system is installed. GSMODS takes about 400K bytes, and the installation program needs about 100K bytes of working space. Note: Entries shown in uppercase must be entered in uppercase. 4. Start Revelation by entering:
jCl>REV SYSPROG

112 Appendix I

GSMODS 1.01

Installation

5. At the colon prompt enter:
jATTACH A:
6. At the colon prompt enter:
jRUN $BP.U INSTALL-GSMODS
If the error message "SBP.U" is not a file name appears on the screen, the wrong disk is in the A: drive. Exit Revelation by entering OFF, place the correct disk in the A: drive, and start again at step #3. 7. The system will begin running the automatic installation program which will prompt for three items of information. First it will prompt for the path name to the Revelation system which is being used. Enter the DOS path name to the Revelation system as it is installed on the computer in use. A typical path name would be C:\REV, where the Revelation system is installed on the C: drive under a sub-directory named REV. Then the installation program will prompt for the account name to be used for the account to be created. Enter any name for the account as long as it is one word (no spaces or punctuation, please). The account name must be entered in uppercase letters! Typically the name of the State or County which contains the data to be entered is used as the account name. Finally, the program will prompt for a password. If a password is entered, it will be required for any subsequent access to the account. If a password is not desired, just press the RETURN key. Several system messages will appear and disappear as files are copied to the new system. These can be safely ignored until the system prompts for the next disk. Periods of three to five minutes may pass with no apparent action. Be patient. It takes awhile to digest all the new features that are being added to the Revelation system. 8. When the installation program has finished copying the information from the first GSMODS distribution disk, it will ask you to replace disk #1 with disk #2 in the A: drive. Press the RETURN key when disk #2 is ready. 9. At the colon prompt the installation is complete. Remove the GSMODS distribution disk from the A: drive and exit Revelation by entering:
_:OFF
The system can be started at any time by entering:
C: > REV accountname
where accountname is the name which was used during installation. After a few moments, the GSMODS Main Menu will appear. See your DOS documentation for information about setting up a batch file to enter the system with a shorter command, if desired.

Installation

DOS file names which are shown with an asterisk extension in the tables on p. 115 may consist of several DOS files with numeric extensions such as .000, .010, etc. To see a directory of Revelation file names (databases), start GSMODS and from the Main Menu press the P9 function key. From the colon prompt (Revelation Command Level, TCL) enter the following command:
:LISTFILES

The States database
NOTE: The following section is only important if you work outside the United States and need to change the valid codes for states (or other political subdivisions).
Each time an entry is made in the State field of either the Locality database or the Reporter information database, the entry is checked to see if it is a valid USPS State abbreviation. The input validation is accomplished by comparing the entry with all of the records in the States database. There is one record in the States database for each valid code; the code (for example, CA) is also the record ID. If GSMODS is to be used for localities outside of the United States, additional codes (for States or other national subdivisions) can be added to the States database by the use of a utility entry screen. To access the States entry screen, start GSMODS and from the Main Menu press the F9 function key. From the colon prompt (Revelation Command Level, TCL) enter the following command:
JENTER ST.ENTRY
An entry screen will appear with two fields. See Chapter 4 for a discussion of entering and editing information on entry screens. The first field on this screen, State Code, is where the desired new state code is entered exactly as it will be entered in the State fields of the Reporter information and Locality databases. State codes are converted to uppercase as they are entered. The second field, State Name, is used to enter the full name of the state being coded. Records can be added, deleted, or edited from this entry screen.

Multiple Accounts
The installation procedure described above (p. 112) creates an initial account on the Revelation/GSMODS system. This may be the only account which is needed if the information in the system belongs to a single project and is not too voluminous. However, if the amount of information begins to make the system unacceptably slow and the information can be easily divided by region or subject, or if information from several projects is being stored on the system, the user may want to create several accounts. Each separate account has its own account name, password, and databases. The remainder of the system, Revelation

116 Appendix I

GSMODS 1.01

Installation

commands and GSMODS menu structure, is shared between all accounts.
The procedure for creating a new account is exactly the same as the procedure for creating the initial account as described on p. 112. Follow the same procedure starting at step 2, p. 112, using a new account name, and the system will create the new account with empty databases. To move some of the information records from the original account to the new account, see the section on transferring data between accounts in Chapter 7. To move from one account to another, select item 10, Exit Revelation, from the Main Menu. At the DOS prompt, enter REV accountname with the name of the new account. The system will re-start at the Main Menu of the new account.

The LOGTO Command
A quicker way to transfer between accounts is to use the LOGTO command. LOGTO is a Revelation command which allows the user to move between accounts without having to exit and re-start Revelation. It is entered from the Revelation Command Level (TCL) colon prompt. To move from one account to another using the LOGTO command, Return to the GSMODS Main Menu and then exit to TCL by pressing the P9 function key. The colon prompt will appear. Enter:
_: LOGTO accountname
where accountname is the name of the new account. Both the command name (LOGTO) and the account name must be entered in uppercase letters. If a password has been created for the new account, Revelation will prompt for the password. If not, the system will go directly to the Main Menu for the new account.

Configuring GSMODS

Appendix II. CONFIGURING GSMODS
To configure GSMODS for the hardware in use, you must run the system setup program. This should be done when GSMODS is first installed on the system, and any time the hardware configuration of the system is changed. When GSMODS is started, the Main Menu will be on the screen. From the Main Menu select item number 9, Utilities. This will bring the Utilities Menu onto the screen. From the Utilities Menu select item number 1, Change System Variables. This choice will bring up the System Setup entry screen (figure 29) .

The System Setup Entry Screen
When the System Setup entry screen is first displayed, the cursor will be in the Record No. field. This data entry screen operates like the other data entry screens within the GSMODS system. It may be helpful to read the detailed sections concerning data entry screens in Chapters 3 and 4 before proceeding with this entry screen. Any number of sets of system variables can be stored in this file; however, only one set is active at a time. The default active set of variables is the set stored in record number 1. Enter a 1 in the Record No. field (or press the RETURN key) to display the current values of the system variables. The system will display the default settings for a system with a monochrome display adapter and typical printer, plotter, and digitizer (figure 30).
Your hardware configuration is likely to be somewhat different than the default settings. At this point, the cursor will be at the Change prompt at the bottom of the screen. Any of the configuration settings can be changed by entering the number of the field (as shown on the screen) at the Change prompt. The screen is divided into four sections. The first set of fields is used to define the type of video display connected to your computer and the colors to use for various types of screen text. Tables of available colors are included in each of the help screens for these fields. The second section is used to define the printer interface and maximum line width at the printer's normal settings. The third and fourth sections are similar and are used to define the interface between the computer and the digitizer and plotter, respectively. To see the help screen with the available options for any field, enter the number of the field at the Change prompt and then enter a ? in the field (or press the Fl function key). To return to the Change prompt without changing the field entry, press the RETURN key. When there are no more changes to be made to the system variables, press the RETURN key at the Change prompt. The system will then use the current screen to reset the system and return with an empty System Setup entry screen. At this point if you enter END in the Record No. field, the system will return to the Utilities Menu.

118 Appendix II

GSMODS 1.01

Configuring GSMODS

Each time the GSMODS system is started, it resets the system variables to the settings in the last record accessed from the System Setup entry screen. There are two records supplied with the system; record number 1 contains default settings for a monochrome display system, and record number 2 (figure 31) contains default settings for a color display system. You can switch between the two records simply by entering the record number at the Record No. prompt and filing the record by entering a return at the Change prompt and then END at the next Record No. prompt to exit from System Setup. To create other combinations without changing the default settings, either enter all the data in a new record by entering a new record number in the Record No. field, or copy one of the default records to a new record number and then edit the desired fields (See Chapter 5 for information on the Revelation COPY command). When the system variables are set to correspond to the computer hardware, exit by entering END at the Record No. field which will return control to the Utilities Menu. To return to the Main Menu from the Utilities Menu, press the P9 function key. Changing the display colors does not affect the GSMODS menu system until you exit the system and return.

Appendix IH. HARDWARE INSTALLATION AND CONFIGURATION

Digitizers

GTCO Digitizer
The switches on a GTCO digitizer must be set to the following options:
parity disabled parity odd 1 stop bit 8 data bits include push-button code include space include carriage return no line feed 5 digit ASCII serial ports A and B alarm disabled RS-232 interface incremental output point/line mode 16-button cursor inch data ASCII data control line activity not monitored
There are two options for cables to connect between the GTCO digitizer and the computer serial port. A straight-through, 4wire modem cable can be attached from port B (J6) on the digitizer to the computer serial port. For this cable, pins 1, 2, 3, and 7 are connected straight through and pins 5, 6, 8, and 20 are tied together on the computer end of the cable. Alternatively, a 4-wire, null-modem cable can be attached from port A (J5) on the digitizer to the computer serial port. For this cable, pins 1 and 7 are connected straight through and pins 2 and 3 are swapped. Pin 2 on one end of the cable is attached to pin 3 on the other end and vice versa. Also, pins 4 and 5 are tied together at each end of the cable and pins 6, 7, 8, and 20 are tied together at each end of the cable.

Calcomp Digitizer
Calcomp models 9000 and 9100 digitizers with the "Universal Formatter Option" can be used by programming the digitizer to emulate a GTCO digitizer. There are two utility programs on distribution disk #2, C9000.BAS and C9100.BAS, which will automatically do the re-programming. Copy the program which corresponds to the model number of your digitizer to the disk and directory which contains your Revelation system before proceeding with the following instructions. These are BASIC programs which

122 Appendix III

GSMODS 1.01

Hardware

require either IBM BASIC/BASICA or GWBASIC to run. Before the programs can be run, the OPEN statement in the program must be correct for your installation. The OPEN statement is currently set for serial port #2 and 4800 baud. To change the settings, run your BASIC interpreter, LOAD the correct program for your digitizer, and LIST the program. You will find a statement number 10 which looks like this:
10 OPEN COM2:4800,N,8,1,RS,CS,DS,CD" AS #1
If your digitizer is attached to serial port #1, change COM2 to COM1 on line 10. If your digitizer is setup to run at a speed other than 4800 baud, change the 4800 to the correct speed on line 10. Do not change anything else in the program. When you are finished changing line 10, press the RETURN key until the cursor is at the bottom of the screen on a blank line. Then SAVE the program to its original name and exit BASIC by entering the word SYSTEM. To run the Calcomp program, enter one of the following commands (depending on your digitizer model and BASIC version) from the DOS prompt:
BASICA C9000 BASICA C9100 GWBASIC C9000 GWBASIC C9100
The program only needs to be run once each time the digitizer is turned on or reset. The program can be run from a batch file which starts your GSMODS system as long as you turn the digitizer on before running the batch program. The program can also be run from Revelation Command Level (colon prompt) by entering a command such as:
jPC BASICA C9000
This command assumes the program is copied onto your Revelation sub-directory and BASICA (or GWBASIC) has a defined path name. A full path name can be substituted for either BASICA or C9000 in the command.
The GTCO 16-button cursor has keys labeled 0 through 9 and A through F. The Calcomp 16-button cursor has keys labeled 0 through 9, A through D, #, and *. Because GSMODS only uses keys 0 through 9 and A through D, the only difference between using the two brands of digitizer with GSMODS is the necessity of running the utility program for the Calcomp. See the Calcomp documentation for instructions on switch settings on the digitizer and on the correct cable to use to connect the digitizer to the computer serial port.

Plotters

Hewlett-Packard 75xx Series Plotters
These plotters must be set to run in the following modes: remote, standalone, hardwire handshake, direct, full duplex, 8 data bits, 1 stop bit, and parity off. The plotter may be set to any speed which is consistent with the selection in the configuration file (see Appendix II, Configuration), but the maximum reliable speed at this time seems to be 4800 baud. The HP 7550A plotter is set by a complex series of soft switches on the front panel; the HP 7570A, 758x, and 759x plotters are set by switches on the rear of the machine. Refer to the plotter documentation for help in locating and setting the switches.
Information on connecting the plotter to the computer serial port is contained in the "Operation and Interconnection Manual" which comes with each Hewlett-Packard plotter.

Hewlett-Packard 7475 Plotter

This plotter is set by switches on the rear of the machine. Switch SI must be off (0) and switch S2 must be on (1). The switch marked D-Y must be in the D position, the switch marked US should be in the US position for using 8 1/2" by 11" or 11" by 17" paper, and the switch marked A3-A4 may be in either position depending on which size paper is most commonly used. Switches B4 through Bl set the communication speed and number of stop bits. The plotter may be set to any speed which is consistent with the selection in the configuration file (see Appendix II, Configuration); but, due to the small memory buffer in this model, the maximum reliable speed at this time seems to be 1200 baud. Communications must be set to 1 stop bit. Refer to the plotter documentation for help in locating and setting the switches. A common configuration to start with is as follows:

Color Choices
There are four fields in the following descriptions which allow the user to select a color for a particular type of information display. The set of acceptable choices is the same for each of the fields and depends on whether the display adapter is monochrome (MDA - no graphics) or color (including color emulation modes). Users with non-IBM systems will have to experiment to see which set of codes works best.

Acceptable Monochrome Codes:
Acceptable monochrome codes consist of a single character which specifies a foreground/background combination. White in the following descriptions refers to the bright color of the monitor whether it is green, amber, blue, white, or whatever.
1 = Black letters on white background 2 = Blinking light gray letters on white background 3 = Blinking black letters on bright white background 4 = Bright white letters on white background 8 = Light gray letters on white background D = Dark gray letters on black background H = Bright white letters on black background I = White letters on black background O = Blinking black letters on light gray background

REPORT 0 Key
Yes
No

This field contains the name of the report which is being defined by the current record. To create a new report definition, enter a new name. To edit an existing report definition, enter the existing report name. Names may be any mix of upper- and lowercase alphanumeric characters. The name is case sensitive, so that test and TEST are two different names. Do not include spaces or punctuation marks in the report name. If a two word name is required, separate words with a hyphen or underscore.

Examples: Paducah REP1 test_plot

Existing records may also be retrieved (and edited) by entering a search parameter instead of a report name. For more information on cross-referencing techniques, see the discussion in Chapter 5.

SYM.NO 0 Key Must be an integer between 1 and 999 Yes Next available empty record number No

This field contains the symbol number which is used by the plotting program to call up the symbol definition. The symbol number must be a 1 to 3 digit integer. User-defined symbols should use the numbers 100 through 999 to avoid conflict with system-defined symbols which use numbers less than 100. To edit an existing symbol, enter the symbol number. To enter a new symbol, press the RETURN key.
Entering the symbol number in the Plot Parameter entry screen causes the symbol to be plotted in a skeletal form. Entering the symbol number with an "F" prefix causes the symbol to be plotted with a filled polygon if the plotter supports automatic polygon fills (PM command in HPGL).

Example: 101

User-defined symbol. To plot in skeletal form, enter 101 in the Plot Parameter entry screen; to plot in filled form, enter F101 in the entry screen.

S.LINES 2 Single-valued
No
No

This field contains the string which describes the parts of the symbol which are not part of a fillable polygon. The string is entered in pseudo-HPGL. Start by assuming that the pen is at the location of the center of the symbol and that the pen is up. The general procedure is to move to the beginning of a line segment with a pen-up command and then to draw a line segment with a pen-down command. Pen-up and pen-down commands are followed by X and Y coordinates. All coordinates are factors to be multiplied by the height of the symbol. For example, the following string would draw a plus symbol to the height and width defined by the symbol height in the Plot Parameter entry screen:

PU,0.5,0;PD,-1.0,0;PU,0.5,0.5;PD,0,-1.0

All X,Y coordinates are relative to the last position. Command names and coordinates are separated by commas. Commands are separated by semi-colons. All coordinate factors (except 0) should be given with a decimal point and leading or trailing zero, as appropriate.
The pen-down command can be followed by several sets of coordinate factors. For example, the following string will plot a square box the size of the symbol height:

206 Appendix XII

This field contains the string which describes the parts of the symbol which make up the outline of a fillable polygon. Start by assuming that the pen is at the location of the center of the symbol and that the pen is up. The general procedure is to move to the beginning of the polygon outline with a pen-up command (PU) and then to draw the outline with a pen-down command (PD). Pen-up and pen-down commands are followed by X and Y coordinates. All coordinates are factors to be multiplied by the height of the symbol. For example, the following string would define the outline of a diamond the full symbol height and half as wide:

PU,0.25,0;PD,-0.25,0.5,-0.25,-0.5,0.25,-0.5,0.25,0.5

All X,Y coordinates are relative to the last position. Command names and coordinates are separated by commas. Commands are separated by semi-colons. All coordinate factors (except 0) should be given with a decimal point and leading or trailing zero, as appropriate. A pen-down command may be followed by several coordinates.
