.

The formation consists of a number of alter-

nating beds, from .10 to 25 feet thick, with

nearly white and dark-gray weathered sur-

faces. The whitish weathered beds are me-

dium to light gray on fresh fracture. Some are

dense and finely banded, resembling some parts

of the Dagmar limestone; others are very

finely crystalline, single grains averaging about

0.2 millimeter in di~meter, with scattered

coarser white grains or patches, some of which

suggest fossil remnants and others short vein-

lets of dolomite and calcite in healed fractures.

When dissolved in hot hydrochloric acid the

dense finely banded variety proves to be rather

argillaceous, leaving small quantities of a light

brownish-gray clay residue, and the finely crys-

talline variety proves to be a pure dolomite

leaving practically no residue. .

OBSCURE UNCONFORMITY AT THE TOP OF THE UPPER CAMBRIAN.
Evidenc~ of an unconformity at the top of the Upper Cambrian, though meager at any one place, is convincing when considered as a whole. The presence of quartzite and of limestone conglomerate with rounded pebbles (intraformational conglomerate is also present) at the base of the Ordovician (Ajax limestone) points to emergence at certain localities. Pebbles of Middle to Upper Cambrian limestone have also. been found in some conglomerate layers of the Opohonga limestone,which overlies the Ajax limestone. A noteworthy occurrence of this kind is in the isolated limestone area east· of Knightville, where scattered pebbles typical of the Bluebird dolomite and a few

Three large areas of effusive rhyolite and one of intrusive rhyolite were mapped during the earlier survey. The southernmost effusive _body, called the Fernow rhyolite, lies mostly to the south of the Tintic quadrangle, but its
north edge is I-! miles north of the southern
boundary, and scattered outliers are mapped as far north as Volcano Ridge. (See Pl. 1.) The northernmost body, to which no specific name was given, lies north of the quadrangle, except for a narrow prong at the northeast base of Pinyon Peak. These two bodies of rhyolite were not studied during the recent survey.
The other effusive body, called the Packard rhyolite, and the intrusive body, designated the Swansea rhyolite, are described below in detail. Besides these, two minor occurrences of rhyolite, designated earlier rhyolite and rhyolite of Tintic Mountain, and one of rhyolite tuff have been distinguished.

The following brief notes will serve to summarize the important characteristics of the different varieties. They are, with one exception, based on study of thin sections made for the earlier report.
A ugite-hypersthene-oiotite variety.-The plagioclase shows a marked zonal growth and has the average composition of basic labradorite, ranging from bytownite (Ab2~80) to basic oligoclase (Ab7~80). The augite has the same properties as that in the lavas already ~e­ scribed, including a pale-green to yellowish pleochroism. It grades from prisms 2 or .more millimeters long down to minute anhedrons in the groundmass. Hypersthene varies in quantity. In some sections it forms a few scattered crystals; in others it is quite as promine~t as the augite. It occurs in short, stout pnsms, mostly 1 millimeter or less in length, and has a marked pleochroism from pale brownish red to colorless. Biotite, magnetite, and apatite present the same features as in all the other volcanic rooks of the district. The groundm~ss r anges from minutely holocrystalline to glassy but in ail sections is of typical effusive character. A chemical analysis of a specimen of this variety collected on Tintic Mountain and said in the earlier report 1 to represent ''a type very important areally and belonging to the latest eruption" is given on page 67.
Hornblende-biotite-augite variety.-The hornblende-biotite-augite variety was found by the writer in the northern part of the area, where . it occurs as an extensive flow north and south of Laguna station and as a dike cutting rhyolite

The rock is medium gray, dense, and por-

sections the resorptwn rims can distrnctly be

anhedrons. This association tends to show

that, in spite of the mineralogic difference, the

hornblendic rock is chemically the same as the

more common hornblende-free varieties. The

biotite is typical. Neither hornblende nor

biotite is represented in the groundmass, and

their place is taken by augite, which is a pro~­

If the garnet and magnetite were included in

small addition of iron oxide from the magma.

nite and the replacement of feldspar by tourmaline in the Swansea rhyolite are evidently pneumatolytic changes that took place immediately after the consolidation of the respective rocks. These, however, are all microscopic features of interest chiefly to the petrographer.
Far more conspicuous is the widespread development of sericite, chlorite, calcite, and silica (quartz, chalcedony, or opal) in the volcanic rocks. Practically all specimens collected contain these minerals, _at least in microscopic amounts, and many contain them in conspicuous megascopic masses. These minerals are so widespread that they can hardly be regarded as due solely to the solutions which deposited the ore bodies, although their origin appears closely related to that of the ore bodies. For example, the banded rhyolite east of the Iron Blossom No.3 mine contains a

bIn December, 1869, West Tintic first attracted attention, and the Sunbeam mine was located. It became the first important producer later, along with the Scotia; then the Eureka Hill, Mammoth, Shoe-

bridge, Martha Washington, Black Dragon, Black Eagle, and Swansea; all operated between 1870 and 1876. In 1873 the Mammoth-Copperopolis (Ajax) and Crismon-Mammoth mines were the principal producers

c. Estimates by V. C. Heikes from a separation of the total output reported by the Director of the Mint, or given in the annual reviews of the Salt Lake Tribune and U. S. ' Geol. Survey Mineral Resources,

1882-1897. Parts of the records of some early producers were used m the estimates.

•

d Estimated by Tower and Smith (op. cit., pp. 615-616)., who gave a table and remarks on production, 1880-1896: "It is thought the :r,roduction of silver and gold previous to 1880 did not exceed $2,000,000 in

value. From 1880 to 1896 inclusive, the productiOn in gola has been 201,967 ounces and in silver 28,308,092 The only method of calcclation of the lead and copper is by finding the ratio of copper to either gold or silver.

ounces. In addition to the silver and gold, As silver is more uniformly distributed in

tTheinotriecshtahsanpr~oodldu,cethdisa

large metal

amount of lead and copper. has been chosen as the basis

of calculation. The average content of oopper and lead in 240,000 tons of ores was 0.6 per cent and 13.5 per cent, respectively. The ores which )lave furnished the basis of this calculation are the reported output

of about two-thirds of the mines of the district. The content of silver of these same ores averages 52.50 ounces per ton. On this basis there are 20 pounds of copper to every 87.5 ounces of silver, and 20 pounds of

lead to every 3.8 ounces of silver. Applying these ratios to the total production of the camp it is shown that there should havt~ been produced 6,470,000 pounds of copper and 74,495 tons of lead for the years from

1880 to 1896, inclusive, thus roughly estimated. These calculations, liowever, judged from. other standpoints seem to be somewhat low for copper and high for lead.'

e In 1877 the Eureka Hill mine commenced to produce silver-lead heavily; in 1882 the Bullion Beck & Champion mine became a silver-lead producer; and in 1886 the Centennial-Eureka mine, although not a

large producer of lead yielded largely gold, silver, and.copper.

QUANTITY OF WATER.

The water is generally encountered in large

quantities and concerted action among mine

owners will be necessary before any consider-

able advance below water level _can be made.

In the monzonite and related porphyry the

quantity of water encountered was large

enough to stop mining operations. No ordi-

nary pumps used at that time were sufficient.

In the Swansea mine a steam pump was

installed in the 700-foot level, and the water

level, which was originally met at 650 feet ·

below the surface was lowered to the 940-foot

level.

In a shaft on the Iron _Duke mine, 370 feet

deep, the water level is 100 feet below the

surface. The flow on the 350-foot level is said

to have been 4,000 gallons a day.

The zinc content of small samples may range from that of pure smithsonite or calamine, over 50 per cent, down to 15 per cent or less in limestone that is only slightly impregnated with zinc minerals. . Shipping ore has mostly contained from 29 to 35 per cent zinc, but for a time early in 1913 ore containing as low as 20 per cent was shipped. Selected samples of the ore, free from insoluble gangue matter, according to Zalinski 1 contain no silver or gold, but the average ore shipped fron1 the May Day mine in 1912, according to Heikes/ contained 0.027 ounce of gold and 2.20 ounces of silver to the ton and 2.57 per cent of lead.
