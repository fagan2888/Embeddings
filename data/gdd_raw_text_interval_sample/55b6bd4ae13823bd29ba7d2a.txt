Terms designating time are La parentheses. Informal time terms early, middle, and late may be used for eras, periods, and epochs where there is no formal subdivision into Early, Middle, and Late. Informal rock terms lower, middle, and upper may be used where there is no formal subdivision of a system or of a series.
1 Age values given are the Holmes "B" time scale points (Holmes, 1947, p. 145). pates are rounded to the nearest 5 million years. The errors are unknown, but more recent age determinations by various physical methods are in partial agreement with these values. For a recent compilation of radiogenic dates see selection of Adolph Knopf in Longwell's "Geologic column and scale of time" (1958, AGI 5).
8 Provincial series accepted for use in U.S. Geological Survey reports are listed under both the time and the rock units.

GEOLOGIC NAMES OF NORTH AMERICA
INDEX TO THE GEOLOGIC NAMES OF NORTH AMERICA
By DRUID WILSON, GRACE C. KEROHER, and BLANCHE E. HANSEN
INTRODUCTION
Beginning in 1902, the U.S. Geological Survey has published five compilations treating the names of geologic formations and stratigraphic classification and nomenclature:
"North American Geologic Formation Names," by F. B. Weeks (Bull. 191, 1902).
"The Geologic Time Classification of the United States Geological Survey Compared with Other Classifications, Accompanied by the Original Definitions of Era, Period, and Epoch Terms," by M. Grace Wilmarth (Bull. 769, 1925).
"Names and Definitions of the Geologic Units of California," by M. Grace Wilmarth (Bull. 826, 1931).
"Lexicon of Geologic Names of the United States (including Alaska)," by M. Grace Wilmarth (Bull. 896, 1938; reprinted 1951, 1957).
"Geologic Names of North America Introduced in 1936-1955," by Druid Wilson, W. J. Sando, R. W. Kopf, and others (Bull. 1056-A, 1957).
The demand for compilations of geologic names is well attested by the circumstance surrounding the completion of the first Survey compilation by F. B. Weeks. In 1899, after it became apparent that the task was too great for one compiler, Survey geologists were asked to help, and were apportioned parts of the geologic literature to review. In this way the compilation was completed and published in 1902. The following geologists participated: M. R. Campbell, N. H. Darton, J. S. Diller, G. H. Girty, C. W. Hayes, F. H. Knowlton, F. L. Ransome, G. 0. Smith, A. C. Spencer, T. W. Stanton, J. A. Taff, T. W. Vaughan, and David White.
Wilmarth's compilation of terms used in geologic-tune classification was published in 1925 and is still invaluable for quotations of the original definitions and descriptions of the standard and other strati-

GEOLOGIC NAMES OF NORTH AMERICA

graphic and tune divisions from widely scattered and sometimes unavailable sources. The California names and their annotations published in 1931 were repeated without change in Wilmarth's lexicon of the United States names in 1938. The reprinting of Wilmarth's lexicon in 1951 and 1957 confirms its place in the field of geologic publications. Brevity of format in "Geologic Names of North America Introduced in 1936-1955" made it possible to bring out quickly a compilation intended to be superseded by the first supplement to Wilmarth's lexicon, now in preparation.
In the present report the geologic names of North America, including Greenland, the West Indies, the Pacific Island possessions of the United States, and the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands, that were published before 1956 are arranged to form a nonalphabetic index to Wilmarth's lexicon and to the "Geologic Names of North America Introduced in 1936-1955." This grouping of the names on the basis of the age and politico-geographic divisions containing the type locality is an easily used key not available elsewhere. The age of each formation (that is, rock unit) named from an area is shown, but not its complete geographic extent. The geologic-tune and timestratigraphic units are grouped together under the major time divisions.
Some names entered in Wilmarth's lexicon have been omitted. They include (a) all paleontologic and descriptive terms, (b) all names of economic units, such as miner's terms, trade names, and subsurface names identical with the names of formal rock units, (c) the names of moraines and other units of which physiography is an essential part of the definition, and (d) the names of orogenies. The American Commission on Stratigraphic Nomenclature (1955, p. 2008) has recommended that the names of moraines and other physiographic units be considered informal and not subject to the rules that apply to stratigraphic names.
The names of the rock units are listed once only in the geographic area that contains or is assumed to contain the type area or locality. Thus, the Grenville series, a geologic name commonly used in the State of New York, is listed under the Canadian province of Ontario, where its type locality occurs; and the Colorado group or shale, used widely in Canada, is under the State of Colorado. Not all geologic formations end at political boundaries.
In the period of more than 20 years since the compilation if Wilmarth's lexicon, many names have been revised and many names not then accepted for use by the U.S. Geological Survey have been adopted. Adoption of names for use by the U.S. Geological Survey is based on the published and unpublished reports of Federal Survey geologists on areas of the United States and its possessions or trust

INDEX TO THE GEOLOGIC NAMES OF NORTH AMERICA 409
territories. The U.S. Geological Survey has had occasion to consider for acceptance or rejection considerably less than one-half of the names of geologic units occurring in the United States. The names of units adopted through 1958 appear in boldface type under their currently designated ages. Changes in the designated rank and age of the named units accepted for use in U.S. Geological Survey reports are shown here as authorized by the Chief Geologist, upon the recommendation of the Geologic Names Committee of the Federal Survey. They embody all changes, published or unpublished, made before July 1, 1959.
Numerous inconsistencies in listed age assignments are apparent in this compilation. These result in part from differences of opinion of the original authors and in part from Survey-accepted revisions and investigations that have been made since the publication of Wilmarth's lexicon. Thus, the inconsistencies illustrate the essential subjectivity of all age assignments and reflect the objectivity that a compiler seeks to attain.
The compilers are responsible for listing changes in the age designations of certain non-Survey names. These are (a) age assignments of a few units whose ages had been listed hi general terms; (b) placing under Paleocene some units formerly listed as Eocene; and (c) assignment of some units of Pennsylvanian age to provincial series in conformance to the nomenclature adopted by agreement of the State geological surveys of Iowa, Kansas, Missouri, Nebraska, and Oklahoma and for the most part accepted by the U.S. Geological Survey.
Age changes and future revisions of all units will be considered in supplements to Wilmarth's lexicon, where they can be adequately documented. The first supplement is now in preparation.
The names are grouped under two main categories: (a) geologic-tune and time-stratigraphic units, and (b) rock units. Only the time units require explanation. There is general agreement among American geologists as to the major practical stratigraphic and time divisions, if not as to their boundaries. Those in use by most geologists and the U.S. Geological Survey are shown in the table (p. rv). Less agreement exists in the use of the term "series." "Series" has been used as a rock (rock-stratigraphic) term of higher rank than "group," but more commonly as a time-stratigraphic (tune-rock) term for a subdivision of a system. In the following reports concerned with stratigraphic classification and nomenclature, "series" has been considered as a part of the time-stratigraphic classification: Schenck and Muller (1941, p. 1421), the American Commission on Stratigraphic Nomenclature (1947, p. 523), Hedberg (1948, p. 452; 1958, p. 1892), Woodring (1953, p. 1082), and Dunbar and Rodgers (1957, p. 297-298). The use of "series" as a time-stratigraphic term has been recom-

410

GEOLOGIC NAMES OF NORTH AMERICA

mended by the American Commission on Stratigraphic Nomenclature (1956, p. 2006), and the U.S. Geological Survey will consider this usage for acceptance when the Commission adopts the revised Stratigraphic Code.
Because of this variance in usage, the names of most series are listed with both the time and the rock units, but a few names of series that are undefined and have had little or no usage for example, the Nutrian series of Jurassic age in Arizona are listed only under the rock units. The names of some series and stages which have been derived from units listed in Wilmarth's lexicon as rock units, and which are currently in wide usage, appear under the time units as a part of the standard sequences of certain periods. These are cited from the various sources from which the standard sequences were taken, and the designation under which they are entered in Wilmarth's lexicon appears in brackets; the Osage series [see Osage group 1] of Early Mississippian age is an example. Precambrian series that have been used to indicate correlative time are listed with the time units, but the majority of the Precambrian series names are listed only under the rock units.

2 Names followed by this superscript are in "Geologic Names of North America Introduced in 1936-1955" (U.S. Geol. Survey Bull. 1056-A).
Names in use by the U.S. Geological Survey for which the rank or lithic designation has been changed are followed by the former designation in parenthesis, except when the original combination is a part of the currently accepted usage. Examples (both from the Pleistocene names of Kansas): Pearlette ash 1 member (of Sappa formation) Missler member (of Ballard formation);(as member of Meade formation 2)

GEOLOGIC TIME AND TIME-STRATIGRAPHIC (TIMEROCK) UNITS
Sequences of units commonly used as standards for North America are given under each major time division. They have been assembled from several sources, but mainly from the correlation charts prepared by the Committee on Stratigraphy of the National Research Council.
Certain of the sequences coincide in part or completely with current usage of the U.S. Geological Survey; thus the units adopted are shown in boldface type. A single unit in boldface within a sequence does not indicate that all or other parts of the sequence have been adopted; only those units appearing in boldface type are currently in use by the Survey. In all instances the precise rank and terminology, and certain restrictions in Survey usage, are noted.

TIME TERMS OF NONGEOGRAPHIC ORIGIN

The terms listed below have been proposed for various units of geologic time.

The nongeographic origin probably indicates that all were intended for world-wide application. A few have had considerable usage, but most of the terms are currently replaced by standard divisions of geologic time (see table, p. iv). The nongeographic term Phanerozoic has come into usage as a convenient ex-

pression covering Cambrian plus all later time. It was proposed as the

Phanerozoic or Phanerpbiotic eon by Chadwick (1930, p. 48) together with the Cryptozoic or Cryptobiotic eon for all Precambrian time. Harris (1932, p. 489) independently proposed the Phenozoic and Cryptozoic eons for the same spans of time.

fYorktownian substage (Virginia) iSt. Marysan substage (Maryland) /Choptankian substage (Maryland) \Calvertian substage (Maryland)

Two sequences of stages are in use for the marine Cenozoic of western North America. The microfaunal stages are based on the chronologic occurrence of species or assemblages of species of foraminifera, believed to be independent of the lithic units in which they are found. The more or less informal megafaunal "stages" are based, according to Durham (1954, p. 23), on the distribution of species of megafossils, mainly mollusks and echinoids, within formations and sequences of formations from which the names of the "stages" are derived. The present arrangement is adapted from the marine Cenozoic correlation chart (Weaver and others, 1944, Chart 11), from later additions to the microfaunal sequence by Natland (1953) and by Mallory (1953; 1954; 1959), and from the charts of Durham, Kleinpell, and Savage (in Durham, 1954, p. 25) and Durham, Jahns, and Savage (1954,
E. 60). The microfaunal stages proposed for the Pliocene nad Pleistocene y Natland have not been fully defined and have not yet been used as widely in publication as the microfaunal stages proposed for the Oligocene by Schenck and Kleinpell (1936) and for the Miocene by Kleinpell (1934; 1935; 1938). The Paleocene and Eocene stages earlier proposed by Mallory were fully defined in 1959. The equivalence of the stages of the microfaunal and megafaunal sequences is fairly well established, but the adherents of the two time scales are not in complete agreement on correlation with the standard major Tertiary divisions. The disparity of the two correlations with the Tertiary divisions is graphically shown below. The spacing of the rules shows only the equivalence of the stages of the two scales; no indication of relative time span is intended. A partly dashed rule indicates doubt concerning precise correlation with the apposed stage. All type areas except those indicated are in California.

PALEOZOIC
A number of names have been proposed for units of great magnitude based on physical and faunal criteria occurring in the rocks of North America. Some of them were thought to be more appropriate for North America than the now standard major stratigraphie and time divisions, which are mainly of European derivation. With the exception of the Mississippian and Pennsylvanian systems, few of these units ever gained very wide acceptance, and none is in current use as a period or system. Some encompass parts or all of more than one of the Paleozoic periods or systems and are so listed below; the others are entered under the appropriate age.

Permian The Permian series commonly in use as the standard sequence in central and southwestern United States (see Longwell, 1958, AGI 5) are typically developed in Texas and New Mexico to which they are restricted in use by the U.S. Geological Survey: Ochoa series 2 (New Mexico) Guadalupe series [see Guadalupe group l (Texas)] ' Leonard series [see Leonard formation 1 (Texas)] Wolfcamp series [see Wolfcamp formation l (Texas)] Other units: Central United States Permian Big Blue series l (Kansas) Cimmaron series [see under Cimmaron group l (Kansas)] Minco division 2 (Oklahoma) Wanette division > (Oklahoma)

Pennsylvanian

The type area of the Pennsylvanian system is in the northern Appalachian region in Pennsylvania, but a better standard section is in West Virginia (Moore and others, 1944, p. 665). The standard sequence for eastern North America, according to the Pennsylvanian correlation chart (Moore and others, 1944, Chart 6), given below, repeats the major stratigraphic divisions commonly used in the eastern United States, except that the Lee and the Kanawha series take the place of the division usually called Pottsville

(p. 666).

Conemaugh series [see under Conemaugh formation l (Pennsylvania)] Allegheny series [see under Allegheny formation l (Pennsylvania)] Kanawha series [see under Kanawha formation l (West Virginia)] kLee series [see Lee formation * or group (Virginia)]

The sequence given for central North America by Longwell (1958, AGI 5) is, with the exception of the Atoka series in place of the Lampasas series, the same sequence given by Moore and others (1944, Chart 6). They state (p. 666) that these series are used also in western North America and are thought to be applicable to the eastern United States and Canada as well. Their use as provincial series by the U.S. Geological Survey is restricted to the mid-Continent region:

Cambrian According to the Cambrian correlation chart for North America (Howell and others, 1944, Chart 1) no stages of the Early Cambrian were established and no stages in the Middle Cambrian satisfactorily denned. Dresbachian (Minnesota), Franconian (Minnesota) and Trempealeauan (Wisconsin) (ascending order), denned by the listed sequence of contained faunal zones, were given as stages covering the Late Cambrian. These are discussed and denned as stages of the Late Cambrian Croixan series by Bell, Berg, and Nelson (1956, p. 415-442).

PRECAMBRIAN
(See also under Time terms of nongeographic origin)
Properly, Precambrian divisions should not be listed under time units. The perennial use of terms such as era, period, and system, reflects the desire of geologists to suggest by terminology the impressive magnitude of the Precambrian sequence and the long time-span necessary for the deposition of the sediments, the emplacement of the igneous rocks, subsequent metamorphism, and the development of notable unconformities. Criteria for consistent worldwide division of this vast expanse of time are inadequate. Stratigraphically significant paleontologic criteria, used for the rest of geologic time, have thus far not been discovered in Precambrian rocks. Radiogenic methods may eventually provide means for inter-regional correlation when there are enough of them, and with reduction of the margin of error in present techniques. Numeric dating, sometimes called the absolute age as opposed to relative age based on fossils, has been determined by radiogenic methods for numerous Precambrian rocks. Whereas this has upheld some lithologic correlations, the results have more commonly shown the unreliability of physical unity as a basis for time-stratigraphic correlation. As a result, in the current period of intensified radiogenic investigations, the use of time and time-stratigraphic (time-rock) divisions in the Precambrian of North America has declined. Among the authors who have discussed the problems of correlation and time divisions within the Precambrian are Leith (1934, p. 169), Grout and others (1951, p. 1020, 1063-1064), Wilson (1952, p. 201-202), Gill (1952, p. 57-67; 1955, p. 25-29; 1955a, p. 117-124), Woodring (1953, p. 1083), Rodgers (1954, p. 658), Knopf (1955, p. 698-699), and Dunbar and Rodgers (1957, p. 298).
