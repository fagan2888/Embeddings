SUMMARIES OF DATA ON AND LISTS OF REFERENCES TO METALLIC AND SELECTED NONMETALLIC MINERAL OCCURRENCES IN THE TANANA QUADRANGLE, ALASKA SUPPLEMENT TO OPEN-FILE REPORT 77-432 PART A SUMMARIES OF DATA TO JUNE 1, 1981
By Edward H. Cobb
Open-File Report 81-1313A 1981
This report is preliminary and has not been reviewed for conformity with U.S. Geological Survey editorial standards and stratigraphic nomenclature.

Introduction

This report was prepared as a supplement to a 1977 report which summarized data on .mineral occurrences in the Tanana quadrangle, Alaska (Cobb, E. H., 1977, Summary of references to mineral occurrences (other than mineral fuels and construction materials) in the Tanana quadrangle, Alaska: U.S. Geological Survey Open-File Report 77-432, 110 p.). As a result of suggestions from users of the series of which to 1977 report is a part, this supplement is released in two parts: Part A, which presents summaries of data to June 1, 1981, and Part B, which consists of reference lists for each occurrence.

In Part A data from most reports released by the Geological Survey, the U.S. Bureau of Mines, and the Alaska Division of Geological and Geophysical Surveys bewteen the cut-off date (January 1, 1977) for the original report and June 1, 1981 have been incorporated in rewritten or new summaries where appropriate. For each occurrence described in Part A the name, U.S. Bureau of Mines mining district, reference that has the occurrence plotted on a map on a scale of 1:250,000 (if there is one), list of mineral commodities, and location data are in the same format as in the 1977 report. Also included is a list of synonyms, owners, operators, and claim names.

In both parts citations are in standard bibliographic format with the exception that references to reports and maps in numbered publication series also show, in parentheses, an abbreviation for the report of map series and the number of the report or map. Abbreviations used are:

In Part B citations to the principal references used in preparing summaries in Part A are preceded by an asterisk. The form of citation used in the reference list for each occurrence is considered sufficient identification for each numbered report or map to be found easily in most libraries. Complete references to reports without identifying numbers are listed at the end of Part B.

Tanana (13.2-13.55, 1.5-2.15) 65 005'-65 007'N, 151 O 10'-151°13'¥

Stream roughly parallel to regional strike of contorted Jurassic(?) and Cretaceous phyllite, slate, shale, sandstone, and siltstone. Valley asymmetrical with steeper southeast wall. Placer gold discovered in 1911 and mined in most years through at least 1975; one or two dredges, operated from 1917 through 1940; production through 1940 probably at least 70,000 fine oz of gold. Depth to bedrock generally about 15 ft; alluvium frozen, requiring thawing ahead of mining. Gold in lower 4 ft of gravel and in top 2-3 ft of bedrock. In addition to gold, concentrates contained magnetite, pyrite, ilmenite, barite, chromite, and hematite. Gold may have been derived from quartz-carbonate veins associated with an east-trending shear zone against which the pay streak appears to terminate

Both creek and bench deposits have been mined; in places 16 in. of bedrock had to be taken up with the gravel. Much of gold is "pumpkin seed," but some is nuggets as large as 10 oz. One assay indicated fineness of 919. Mining began by 1896 and continued until at least as recently as 1940. Most concentrate samples and much of mining in part of creek in Livengood quad.

Small gossan (MF-371, loc. 5; at 65°05'N, 150°57'W) in quartzite; random sample contained 1.34 oz/ton Ag. Placer deposit (MF-371, loc. 28; at 65°05'N, 150°55'W) consisted of small, discontinuous, not particularly rich concentrations in as much as 40 ft of gravel; total depth to bedrock is 24-85 ft. Total recorded production, 1907-56, was 61 oz gold and 300 Ib cassiterite concentrate; probably total production was much more and mainly included with that from Sullivan Cr. Concentrates contained gold and cassiterite and (by implication in a general statement) aeschynite, columbite, monazite, and zircon. Tailings piles contain cobbles of brecciated quartz with brown tourmaline and cassiterite. Recovery from samples of tailings averaged 2.67 Ib concentrate per yd3 containing 1.00 Ib Sn and 0.02 oz Au.

Tanana (15.3, 1.5) 65°04'N, 150°56'W

Discovered by drilling program in 1912. Sporadic drift mining and resluicing of old tailings piles until 1940. Old channel cut across a series of terraces in bedrock with local enrichment at each channel-terrace intersection. Pay gravel in fairly continuous narrow pay streak beneath 35-120 ft of muck. Concentrates contain gold, cassiterite, columbite, and probably aeschynite, monazite, and zircon (reference, Moxham, 1954 (C 317), p. 5) is not clear). Total production through 1956 was 17,576 oz gold, 2,668 oz silver, and 101,875 Ib cassiterite concentrate. Analyses of U.S. Bureau of Mines channel samples of tailings piles indicated per yd3 recovery of 2.635 Ib concentrate containing 0.775 Ib Sn, 0.0175 Ib Nb205, and 0.0175 oz Au. As much as 770 Nb205 in individual samples. See also (Sullivan Cr.).

Tanana (20.95-21.0, 6.9-7.5) 65°22'-65°24'N, 150°08'W

Gold discovered in 1890's. Valley narrow; incised into closely folded middle Paleozoic slate, limestone, quartzite, and schist and Permian to Triassic diabase, shale, and tuff; Tertiary continental rocks near mouth. Valley has several terraces on east side at elevations above creek of 10 to about 1,000 ft near mouth; some terraces extend up tributary valleys; terraces approach creek gradient upstream. Top terrace capped by 100 ft of Pliocene(?) gravel. Terrace gravels auriferous; gold reconcentrated into rich placers on some of tributaries, but placers on main stream too low grade to support small-scale mining. Much of mining was bar sniping and small operations in richer spots. In places most of gold (probably of local derivation rather than from the benches) was in nuggets weighing 1-4 oz. Total production certainly was no more than a few thousand ounces; may have been less than 1,000 oz; most of reported mining probably was on tributaries. Nuggets of native silver accompany gold.
