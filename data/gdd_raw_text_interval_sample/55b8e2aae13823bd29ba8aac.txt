CHEMICAL QUALITY OF WATER AND SEDIMENTATION IN THE MOREAU RIVER DRAINAGE BASIN, SOUTH DAKOTA
By B. R. Colby, C. H. Hembree, and E. R. Jochens

ABSTRACT
This report gives the results of an investigation by the U. S. Geological Survey of the sediments and dissolved minerals that are transported by the Moreau River.
The Moreau River drainage basin is a narrow basin in northwestern South Dakota that covers about 5, 360 square miles ofrolli.Q.g, grassy plains, which are broken by buttes and by some small areas of badlands. It is underlain by shales, sandstones, siltstones, and limestones that are primarily of Cretaceous age. Precipitation averages about 16 inches per year. Average annual runoff is about 0. 7 inch but varies widely from year to year.
The chemical quality of the water in the Moreau River is directly related to the geology of the area. Water affected by the Hell Creek formation and Fox Hills sandstone is predominantly a sodium bicarbonate type, whereas water affected by the Pierre shale is a sodium sulfate type. In general, water from streams that drain areas underlain by the Pierre shale is more mineralized than water that drains from areas underlain by the Fox Hills sandstone. Water that drains from areas underlain by the Hell Creek formation is least mineralized.
The short-term chemical-quality records obtained during a wet climatic cycle are not representative of a long term. The average specific conductance and average percent sodium, each weighted with the '~(Vater discharge and adjusted to include estimates during unsampled periods of low flow, were computed for the 3-year period at Bixby, S. Dak. The averages show that if all the water for the entire period were impounded without loss, the specific conductance would be 632 micromhos and the percent sodium would be 57. This water rates as good to permissible for irrigation. However, the estimated rating for a 21-year period is permissible to doubtful. In addition, water impounded during a dry climatic cycle would be conducive to the formation of black alkali if this water were applied to the soil. Therefore, the impounded water should be used only on land where adequate drainage facilities are provided and where infiltration rates are sufficient to provide low rates of evaporation and high rates of flushing.
Suspended sediment transported by the Moreau River is mostly fine material, principally clay sizes. Median particle sizes not weighted with water discharge averaged about 0.0016 millimeter for the stations at Bixby and near Faith.

From April 28, 1949, to September 30, 1951, the MoreauRiveratBixbydischarged about 175,000 acrefeet of water and about 1, 080, 000 tons of suspended sediment. Approximately 90 percent of the water and the suspended sediment was discharged during the water year that ended September 30, 1950. During this water year the streamflow averaged about 2% to 3 times the normal flow. If deposited in a reservoir, the 1, 080, 000 tons of sediment would occupy a computed space of about 980 acre-feet soon after deposition.
From August 15, 1946, to September 30, 1949, the Moreau River near Faith discharged about 380,000 acre-feet of water and nearly 2, 000, 000 tons of suspended sediment. If deposited in a reservoir, the sediment would occupy a computed space of about 1,820 acre-feet soon after deposition.
INTRODUCTION
Purpose and Scope of Investigation
The investigation by the Geological Survey of chemical quality of surface waters and of sedimentation in the Moreau River drainage basin is part of the program of the Department of the Interior for the development of the Missouri River basin. The overall plan includes regulation and control of flood waters, irrigation ofadditionalland, and productionof hydroelectricÂ· power. One requirement for the planning of suecessful and economical projects for this overall plan is a knowledge both of the chemical quality of the surface waters and of the quantity and particle sizes of the sediment that is transported by the streams.
Successful irrigation depends not only on the type of soils, drainage, and climate but also on the chemical quality of the water to be used. Data on the chemical quality of surface water in the Moreau River basin were collected and interpreted to show the variation in the quality of the water and the changes that may be expected in the chemical quality when the water is impounded in a reservoir. In this investigation the quality and quantity of dissolved constituents in the main stream were correlated insofar as possible with geologic, climatic, hydrologic, and cultural characteristics of the drainage basin.
The samples analyzed for dissolved constituents were collected at four gaging stations that are operated by the Geological Survey. Samples were collected daily at stations at Bixby, March 1949 to September 1951, and near Faith, April 1947 to September 1949, and infrequently at stations near Faith, November 1945

co March 1947. and Eagle Butte and Promise, November 1945 to September 19 51. The analyses of these samples and, in addition, the analyses of samples that were collected from major tributaries for a special salinity study are the basis for the chemical-quality discussions of this report. Dissolved solids, specific conduct:;tnce, pH, silica, iron, calcium, magnesium, sodium, potassium, bicarbonate, sulfate, chloride, fluoride, nitrate, boron, percent sodium, total hardness, and noncarbonate hardness usually were determined. For some samples sodium and potassium were calculated .and reported as sodium; boron was not always determined.
The investigation of sedimentation in the Moreau River basin was undertaken to determine (1) the quantity of sediment in transport in the Moreau River, (2) the initial specific weight of the suspended sediment after deposftion in a reservoir, and (3) the probable sources of the sediments. The Geological Survey operated daily sediment stations on the Moreau River near Faith from August 1946 to September 1949 and at Bixby from April 1949 to September 1951. Samples of suspended sediment were collected at these stations to be analyzed for particle size as well as for concentration of suspended sediment.
Geologic studies were made during the investigation to provide a background of information that is essential to the understanding and interpretation of the base data, both on chemical quality and on sediment. Pertinent published reports were reviewed, and a reconnaissance of the basin was made to study the rocks of the area and their relationship to the dissolved minerals and to the sediment that is transported by the streams. The sediment and dissolved solids carried by the streams in solution, in suspension, or as bed load were originally derived from the rocks that underlie the basin.
Previous Investigations
From April 1941 to May 1945, employees of the Bureau of Reclamation collected and analyzed qualityof-water samples from stations on the Moreau River. They also collected and analyzed two samples from Rabbit Creek, a tributary above the gaging station near Faith.
Measurements of suspended- sediment discharge were made by the Corps of Engineers, U. S. Army, on the Moreau River at Promise on 4 days. April13 to 16, 1931. Surface samples were obtained at Promise during the period February 8 to July 31, 1931 (Congressional documents, 1934, p. 37). 1/ Suspendedsediment records were also obtained by the Corps of Engineers from June 1947 to September 1951.
Many reports on the geology of the Moreau River basin have been published, but most of them were concerned principally with coal resources and structural geology. So far as is known, no one has used geology

to assist in solving the quality-of-water and sedimentation problems of the area.
Personnel and Acknowledgments
This investigation was made by the Geological Survey in cooperation with other agencies of the Department of the Interior. It was conducted by the Water Resources Division of the Geological Survey, C. G. Paulsen, chief hydraulic engineer, and S. K. Love, chief of the Quality of Water Branch, Washington, D. C., and was under the general supervision of P. C. Benedict, regional engineer, Lincoln, Nebr.
Water samples for chemical analyses and for suspended- sediment determinations were collected by employees of the Bureau of Reclamation for the station at Bixby from March 1949 to September 1951.
Chemical analyses of surface-water samples were made by personnel of the office at Lincoln, Nebr., under the supervision of H. A. Swenson.
Records of suspended-sediment discharge of the Moreau River were obtained by personnel of the office at Dickinson, N. Dak., under the supervision of E. J. Tripp.
Unpublished streamflow records were furnished by R. E. Marsh and H. M. Erskine, district engineers, Geoi.ogical Survey, Bismarck, N. Dak.
An unpublished report in the open files of the Geological Survey by H. A. Swenson entitled ''A progress report on the chemical character of surface waters in the Moreau River basin, South Dakota,'' covered the chemical-quality data that had been collected before October 1, 1947. It was used as a basis for much of the discussion of chemical quality of water in this report.
MOREAU RIVER DRAINAGE BASIN
Location and Extent
The Moreau River drainage basin is in northwestern South Dakota and covers an area of 5,360 square miles. (See fig. 1.) The drainage basin is bounded by low divides that separate it from the drainage basins of the Grand River to the north, the Cheyenne River to
â¢the south, and the Little Missouri River to the west.
The Moreau River is formed by the junction of the South Fork and the North Fork. The two forks head near the South Dakota-Montana State line and flow eastward to a junction in the southwest corner of T. 14 N., R. 11 E. From this confluence the Moreau River flows eastward to join the Missouri River in T. 16 N. , R. 31 E., about 18 miles south of Mobridge. The Moreau River drainage basin is about 180 miles long.
The principal tributaries of the Moreau River are the No.rth and South Forks, Deep Creek, Flint Rock

Topography

Soils and Vegetation

The Moreau River drainage basin is a part of the Missouri Plateau division of the Great Plains province. The general topography of the area is shown by figure 2. The basin is an area of rolling plains partly dissected by streams and broken in places by buttes and badlands. (See fig. 3.) Most of the badlands and associated buttes are in the western half of the basin. The stream valleys in this part of the basin are well below the general level of the land, but they do not have the canyonlike proportions of stream valleys in the eastern part.
In general, the valleys are narrow and have a series of terraces that rise stairlike from the present flood plain up to and blend into the uplands. The stream channels, except where they impinge against high terraces, have low but steep banks. Like the valleys in which they flow, the streams have a meandering pattern. {See fig. 4.) Parts of the lowlands along the streams are used for growing hay, but most of the land of the stream valleys and the rolling uplands is used for grazing. Some small grains are grown in the eastern part of the basin.
Buttes, which rise sharply from the plains, are scattered throughout the basin but are most numerous in the western part. They are so numerous in one county that it is called Butte County. The buttes were formed by weathering and erosion of sedimentary strata that have different degrees of resistance to erosion. The relatively soft rock beneath a more resistant cap rock erodes rapidly and produces the flat-topped hills with clifflike sides. Debris from the undermined cap rock forms a border of rubble at the base of the buttes or lies temporarily on the side slopes.

The soils in the Moreau River drainage basin belong to one broad soil group, the Chestnut group. All the soils are similar except in texture, because the climate and geology are generally uniform throughout the basin.
Most of the basin is underlain by rocks of Cretaceous age--the Pierre shale, Fox Hills sandstone, and Hell Creek formation. (See fig. 6.)
Soils derived from the Pierre shale in the western part of the basin are known locally as black gumbo and have been classed as Pierre clay in an unpublished report of the Bureau of Land Management. The soils developed on the Pierre shale in the eastern part of the basin haye been classed as the Boyd series. The surface of these soils is dark brown to dark olive brown. Both the Boyd series and the Pierre clay are shallow, immature residual soils. The unaltered or partly weathered shale is usually within 3 feet of the surface of level land and is much closer under sloping surfaces. The shaeowness and immaturity of soils on the Pierre shale are due more to the imperviousness of the parent rock rather than to erosion or any other cause. Soils overlying the Pierre shale absorb water slowly and are readily eroded on the steeper slopes.
Soils developed from the Fox Hills sandstone and Hell Creek formation belong to the Morton series and cover about half the basin. These soils have a 4- or 5-inch surface layer of dark-brown friable loam or silt loam. Because they absorb and hold water, they sustain a dense stand of vegetation on the more level surfaces.

the region during the Paleozoic and Mesozoic eras (Rothrock and Robinson, 1938, p. 4-28).
The rocks of the Pierre shale are the oldest exposed in the drainage basin. The material composing them was deposited in the great inland sea that covered South Dakota, as well as most of central North America, during the Cretaceous period. The Pierre shale was formed from fine particles that were carried to the sea by the streams, carbonates that were precipitated when the fresh waters of the rivers mingled with the saline waters of the sea, and volcanic dust. The Pierre shale consists principally of very dark gray to black clays and shales. Beds of marl and impure chalk, as well as calcareous and gypsiferous concretions, are in the formation. Bentonite, an alteration product of volcanic dust, is characteristic of the Pierre shale. It occurs in thin beds and is interspersed in the shale itself:
As the Cretaceous sea slowly retreated from the land, near-shore deposits of sand and sandyclay were laid down over the clays of the Pierre shale. These near-shore deposits became the brown to yellow sandstones and sandy shales of the Fox Hills sandstone. In some exposures of the contact of the two formations, a distinct difference in the color and lithology can be seen between the top of the Pierre shale and the bottom of the Fox Hills sandstone. However, in other exposures the change is gradual from the darkgray shale of the Pierre shale to the well-cemented sandstone of the Fox Hills sandstone.
After the deposition of the near-shore deposits <Of the Fox Hills sandstone, the land was elevated above the sea long enough for 200 to 300 feet of continental sediments to be deposited. The continental deposits consist of alternating strata of sandstone, shale, bentonite, and thin beds .of coal. Plant fragments, coal, land vertebrate remains, and the lack of continuity of the beds indicate the continental origin of these deposits, which have been grouped together under the name Hell Creek formation.
During the Paleocene epoch of the Tertiary period the seas covered part of the Moreau River basin. Marine deposits in the eastern part of the basin were laid down contemporaneously with continental deposits in the western partof the basin. The Cannonball formation consists of material that was deposited in the sea, and the Ludlow member of the Fort Union formation is composed of continental deposits. All the Cannonball formation has been removed from the basin by erosion but is still present farther north. Only a small area of the Ludlow member still remains. This member consists of sandstone, shale, coal, and clay and can be distinguished from the underlying Hell Creek formation mainly by color. The Ludlow member is characteristically yellowish, whereas the Hell Creek formation is dull brown to gray.
Small remnants of the White River group of Oligocene age remain on the tops of several buttes in the western part of the basin. Rocks younger than the Ludlow member and older than the White River group probably were originally present over much of this area, but they were eroded away before the deposition of the White River group. The Chadron formation,

which is the basal formation of the White River group, consists of gravels, sandstone, clay, and silt and is a b.uff color. The overlying Brule clay is composed of silt, clay, volcanic ash, and minor amounts of sandstone.
Rocks of Miocene and Pliocene age probably were once present in the area but have been removed by post-Pliocene erosion.
Although the Moreau River basin was profoundly affected by Pleistocene glaciation, it was not covered by continental glaciers except in the extreme eastern part. Scattered erratic boulders along the lower reaches of the Moreau River are probably residuals left by erosion of drift.
Before Pleistocene glaciation the Missouri River did not flow through South Dakota. In pre-Pleistocene time the present Moreau, Grand, and Cheyenne Rivers were the headwaters of the Red River of the North, which then, as now, flowed into the HusdonBay (Petsch, 1946, p. 8). During the Pleistocene epoch the Moreau River and other streams parallel to it were blocked by the Kansan or Nebraskan ice sheets or both. The combined flow of these streams was diverted to the southeast along the front of the ice sheet and eroded the present channel of the Missouri River. The diversion of the Moreau River radically changed its gradient and caused rapid downcutting, especially in the lower reaches.
Recent alluvial deposits are present along all streams in the drainage basin. Their lateral extent and depth depend on several variable factors) such as the relative erodibility of the rocks in the uplands, the area of the drainage basin, and the runoff. Recent alluvial deposits are probably the largest immediate source of sediment in the Moreau River basin. The depth and lateral extent of these deposits are partly dependent on the supply of material from the consolidated rocks. Therefore, areas of high sediment yield are directly related to areas of exposed rocks that have relatively low resistance to erosion.
PHYSICAL CHARACTERISTICS OF STREAMS
Among the factors controlling the characteristics of a drainage area are climate, topography, and the rocks that underlie the area. The interaction of these and other factors determines the characteristics of the stream. The environmental factors are interdepen~ent. That is, if the environmental factors of two drainage areas are identical at the beginning of an erosion cycle, the soils, vegetation, and topography of the two areas will be similar at the end of a given time provided the climate does not change. If, however, the rocks of the two areas are different and the climate is the same, the vegetation and topography will gradually become dissimilar in the two areas. For example, the climate of the Moreau River basin and the climate of the lower part of the White River basin are much alike, yet badlands are characteristic of the White River basin and rolling hills are typical of the Moreau River basin. The different types of rocks that underlie the two basins account for this difference in topography.

Moreau River
The Moreau River is formed by the junction of its North and South Forks in the southeast corner of T. 14 N., R. 11 E. It falls about 4 feet per mile as it flows eastward to join the Missouri River at a point about 18 miles south of Mobridge. From the junction of its forks toT. 19 E., R. 14 N., northwest of Dupree, the river flows successively over outcrop areas of the Pierre shale, Fox Hills sandstone, Hell Creek formation, and again over an outcrop area of the Fox Hills sandstone. For most of the distance it flows over the outcroparea of the Fox Hills sandstone. After leaving the outcrop area of the Fox Hills sandstone, the river flows to the Missouri River over an area underlain by the Pierre shale. East of T. 19 E., in the section underlain by Pierre shale, the Moreau River has cut a meandering valley 200 to 300 feet below the uplands.

whose upper reaches are underlain by the Hell Creek formation, has a very descriptive name. Above the junction with Sand Creek the South Fork flows between high banks of alluvium and on a bed of fine material. Below the junction with Sand Creek its bed is composed of sand and coarser material.
North Fork, Deep Creek, Rabbit Creek, Flint Rock Creek, and Thunder Butte Creek
The gumbo clays and sands of the Hell Creek formation underlie most of the drainage areas of the North Fork and Deep, Rabbit, Flint Rock, and Thunder Butte Creeks. In the upper reaches, all these streams are actively eroding their channels; but in the lower reaches, where the channel slopes are lower, they meander and have much the same characteristics as the Moreau River.

Although the suspended-sediment load that is transported by the Moreau River is composed almost entirely of particles of clay and silt sizes, most of the bed material is sand size or larger. The velocity of the stream may be sufficient to prevent deposition of the smaller particles, but probably the dissolved mineral characteristics of the stream are also a factor. 'T'he effect of sodium in preventing flocculation, toge,'ler with the capacity of the stream to transport clay- and silt-size particles, impedes the deposition of small partie les on the stream bed.

Little Moreau River, Bear Creek, and Virgin Creek
Pierre shale and the Fox Hills sandstone underlie the drainage areas of the Little Moreau River and Bear Creek. The drainage basin of Virgin Creek, which discharges into the Moreau River at Promise, is underlain by Pierre shale. All three streams have cut deep valleys; and, except for Bear Creek, they have steep gradients near their headwaters.

South Fork Moreau River
The South Fork Moreau River rises near the South Dakota-Montana State line in T. 14 N., R. 1 E. and flows eastward to join the North Fork at a point about 6 miles northeast of Inland. The drainage basin of the South Fork is underlain by the Pierre shale except for a few areas that are underlain by the Fox Hills sandstone and the Hell Creek formation and are drained by tributaries. One of these tributaries, Sand Creek,

RUNOFF
Most tributaries of the Moreau River are intermittent. They flow after heavy rainfall and during the spring when the winter snow is melting. The Moreau River itself has no flow during parts of many years.
Records of the flow of the Moreau River have been obtained at four gaging stations (fig. 1) . No continuous streamflow records have been obtained on the tributaries.

Flow of the Moreau River varies widely from year to year. (See fig. 7.) At Promise the water discharge for the 21-year period that ended September 30, 1951, averaged 273 cfs. The minimum annual average discharge during the period was 20 cfs during water year 1934, and the maximum annual average discharge was 812 cfs during water year 1950.
Diversions and storage for irrigation have no appreciable effect on the flow of the Moreau River. Small amounts of water are collected in stock ponds during periods of surface runoff.

snowmelt, but most comes from rains during late spring and early summer. Ground -water inflow to the Moreau River is low during most years, and the river has no flow for many days in some years. As the climate, topography, and soils are nearlyuniform throughout the drainage basin, runoff is probably about the same from all parts of the basin. Figure 7 shows that the discharge per square mile by water years differs only a little from one gaging station to another.
CHEMICAL QUALITY OF THE WATER

Runoff from the Moreau River drainage basin averaged about 0. 7 inch during the period of streamflow records at Promise. Some runoff comes from the

Moreau River is to be impounded, salt concentrations during periods of low and normal flows and the effect of dilution by flood flows should be evaluated. A study of the relationship between the geology and the dissolved minerals in the water may help toward a better understanding of the changes in the quality of the water from one place to another. Therefore, places for collection of samples on the Moreau River were so selected as to obtain analytical data on composition and concentrationof the water in the upper, middle, and lower parts of the river. In addition, information on the chemical quality of the major tributaries and on the effect of tributary inflow on the Moreau River was obtained by a special salinity survey. The locations of sampling sites are shown in figure 1.
Geochemistry of Water
The mineral matter dissolved in natural waters is derived from the rocks and soils. Differences in the mineral composition of waters are due to many factors, some of which are (1) the availability of soluble minerals in the rocks and soils, which is decreased by leaching and is increased by exposure of fresh surfaces to erosion; (2) the rate of leaching of minerals, which depends on the solubility of the minerals, the length of time the water is in contact with these minerals, and the temperature of the water; and (3) the character of the rocks.
Soluble minerals are abundant in the rocks and soils of the Moreau River basin, but they are more available in the upper reaches, where slumping has exposed more fresh surfaces.
The length of time during which the water is in contact with the rocks and soils has a direct bearing on the salinity of many streams and rivers. However, in the Moreau River basin most of the water leaves the basin in a relatively short period of time, usually 2 to 4 months. Nevertheless, the surface waters of the Moreau River basin are not especially low in mineralization during relatively high flows. The soluble salts deposited on the surface of the valley sides by capillary action and evaporation during the dry months of the year are immediately available for solution by rain or storm waters. (See fig. 8.) Thus, the concentration of minerals in the Moreau River water may be appreciable even during relatively high water discharges.
The chemical character of a water is directly related to the lithology or composition of the rocks with which the water comes into contact. For the most part, the Moreau River basin is underlain by the nonmarine Hell Creek formation, the marine Fox Hills Â·sandstone, and the marine Pierre shale, all of which affect the water quality.

1. A calcium bicarbonate water forms from thereactionof the carbon dioxide-charged meteoric waters with the calcareous sands, which are common in the Hell Creek formation.
2. Calcium or magnesium is replaced with sodium from beidellite in the bentonitic clay in the formation.
Ca++ + 2HC03- + beidelliteÂ· 2Na ~ 2Na+ + 2HC03- + beidelliteÂ·Ca
3. Gypsum in the formation changes the sodium bicarbonate water to a sodium sulfate water. Sodium sulfate usually is characteristic of certain formations of Cretaceous age in the west. (Lindgren, 1932.)
2Na+ + 2HC03- + ca++ + S04 = ~2Na+ + S04= + CaC03 + C02 + H20
The oxidation of the pyrites and marcasites in the Hell Creek formation may also account for part of the sulfate.
FeS2 + 70= + H20 ~Fe+++ 2H+ + 2S04 =
2Na+ + 2HC03- + 2H+ + S04 = --7 2Na+ + so4 = + 2H2o + 2co2
Water that drains from the Fox Hills sandstone is very similar in type to water that drains from the Hell Creek formation. The gray glauconitic marine quartz sandstone, sometimes interbedded with greenish-gray Â· marine shales, produces a water ordinarily high in sodium and bicarbonate. The sodium bicarbonate in water is formed by the same processes as in the Hell Creek formation; however, the water that drains from the marine Fox Hills sandstone should be more saline.
Water influenced by the Pierre shale is somewhat different in type than waters influenced by the Hell Creek formation and Fox Hills sandstone. Calcium sulfate in the form of gypsum, calcium carbonate as calcite or aragonite, sodium salts in the form of bentonite, and iron sulfide in the form of pyrite or marcasite are in the exposures. As a result of solution and other chemical reactions with these minerals, the water that drains from the Pierre shale is characteristically a sodium sulfate type. The water contains large quantities of dissolved constituents because soluble minerals are abundant and because constant slumping of exposed shale brings unweathered minerals to the surface. The percent sodium is somewhat lower in water that drains from the Pierre shale than in water that drains from the Hell Creek formation and Fox Hills sandstone. This is probably due to the presence of the alkaline earth minerals, rather than the absence of alkali metal minerals.

Relation of the Rocks to Quality of Water
Water drainingÂ·from the Hell Creek formation usuallyhas ahighpercent sodium. The sodiumis insolution primarily as sodium bicarbonate. The Hell Creek formation contains minerals that are necessary to produce a sodium bicarbonate or sulfate water. Several reactions are involved. For example:

Chemical Quality Records
The general relationship between the quality of the water in the tributaries and the quality of the water in the main stem of the Moreau River can be seen from the special salinity study. More detailed records of the four stations on the main stem are listed separately.

The mineral concentrations during periods of high and low flows in the Moreau River for the years 194551 are shown in figure 9. These concentrations do not represent weighted averages. They show the diluting action of snowmelt and heavy rains and the high concentrations of the water during low flows. The graphs for each station are for periods of sampling at that station; therefore, graphs for one station should not be compared with graphs for another station:

Expression of Results of Analyses

The expressions of results are in accordance with those listed in the U. S. Geological Survey WaterSupply Paper 1102 (1952, p. 5-6) as follows:

The dissolved mineral constituents are reported in parts per million. A part per million is a unit weight of a constituent in a million unit weights of water. . . . An equivalent per million is a unit chemical combining weight of a constituent in a million unit weights of water and is calculated by dividing the concentration in parts per million by the .chemical combining weight of the constituents. For convenience in making this conversion the reciprocals of chemical combining weights of the most commonly reported constituents are given in the following table:

those analyses where sodium and potassium are reported separately by dividing the equivalents per million of sodiumby the sum of the equiva- Â· lentsÂ· per million of calcium, magnesium, sodium, and potassium and multiplying the quotient by 100. In analyses where sodium and potassium were calculated and reported as a combined value, the value reported for percent sodium will include the equivalent quantity of potassium. In most waters of moderate to high concentration, the proportion of potassium is much smaller than that of sodium. . . . Hydrogen-ion concentration (pH) is given as the negative logarithm of the number of moles of ionized hydrogen per liter of water.
A weighted-average analysis represents approximately the composition of water that would be found in a reservoir containing all of the water passing a given station during the year {Or period7 after thorough mixing in the reservoir. The weighted-average analysis is computed by multiplying the discharge for the sampling period by the quantities of the individual constituents for the corresponding period and dividing the sum of the products by the sum of the discharges.
Specific conductance, expressed as micromhos, is an electrical measurement of the ionized salts in solution.
Salinity Study
Spot samples were taken from the major tributaries and main stem of the Moreau River April 12 to 16, 1949, after the major part of the water from the spring thaw had run off. The following discussion is therefore not applicable for periods of flood or other high runoff. However, a correlation between geology and water quality during normal or low flow, when the percentage of ground water in the stream is greater, is more reliable than at times when storm or melt waters dilute the streamflow. The locations of sampling sites for this special salinity survey are shown in figure 1, and the analyses of 21 surface-water samples are given in table 6, The principal mineral constituents are expressed graphically in figure 10 .

Results given in parts per million can be converted to grains per United States gallon by dividing by 17. 12. A calculated quantity of sodiurn and potassium is given in some analyses and is the quantity of sodium needed in addition to the calcium and magnesium to balance against the acid radicals â¢ Â·
The total hardness, as calcium carbonate (CaC03), is calculated from the equivalents of calcium and magnesium . . . The hardness caused by calcium and magnesium (and other ions if significant) equivalent to the carbonate and bicarbonate is called carbonate hardness; the hardness in excess of this quantity is called noncarbonate hardness.
In the analyses of most waters used for irrigation, the quantity of dissolved solids is given in tons per acre-foot as well as in parts per million. Percent sodium has been computed for

The concentrations of dissolved minerals are highest in samples from the South Fork, which drains an area that is underlain by the Pierre shale. The dissolved mineral matter in these samples is predominantly sodium sulfate and contains appreciable amounts of calcium and magnesium and a small amount of bicarbonate. Samples from allother tributaries represent waters that drain from areas underlain mostly by the Fox Hills sandstone and the Hell Creek formation. Sodium bicarbonate characterizes these waters.
Waters from Deep, Rabbit, Antelope, and Sand Creeks and the North Fork Moreau River drain from areas underlain principally by the Hell Creek formation and have a higher percent sodium than other surface waters of the basin. However, the water from Sand Creek at Mason has been influenced by the Fox Hills sandstone and Pierre shale, as shown by high mineral content and high percentage of sulfate. Flint Rock, Thunder Butte, and Worthless Creeks drain areas underlain principally by the Hell Creek forma14

tion Â·except in the lower reaches, which are underlain by the Fox Hills sandstone. Therefore, the samples represent mixtures of two types of water. Waters that drain from the Fox Hills sandstone and Pierre shale are more mineralized than waters that drain frotn the Hell Creek formation. The difference in concentrations is probably related to the nonmarine origin of the HellCreek formation and to the marine origin of the Fox Hills sandstone and the Pierre shale.
The percentage composition of the water in the South Fork and in the entire main stem of the Moreau River shows the effect of the outcrops of Pierre shale, and the percentage is not altered materially by the relatively dilute water .that drains from areas that are underlain by the Hell Creek formation.
Moreau River at Bixby
Samples were collected daily from the Moreau River at Bixby from March 6, 1949, to September 30, 1951. The results of chemical analyses are given in table 7.
Water passing the station at Bixby is a mixture of water from the North and South Forks. Consequently, the Hell Creek formation, Fox Hills sandstone, and Pierre shale jointly contribute to the mineralization of the water. (See fig. 6.) When the discharge is low, nearly base flow, the water is highly mineralized and predominantly sodium sulfate. This is chiefly due to the Pierre shale, which underlies most of the South Fork and part of the North Fork.
Moreau River near Faith
Analyses of seven samples that were collected from April 16, 1941, to May 7, 1945, were furnished by the Bureau of Reclamation. Seven additional spot samples were collected bythe GeologicalSurvey from November 29, 1945, to March 26, 1947. Samples were collected daily from April 9, 1947, through September 30, 1949. Results of chemical analyses for all these samples are given in table 8.
The water in the Moreau River near Faith is similar to the water at Bixby. However, water from Rabbit and Deep Creeks enters the main stem upstream from the station near Faith and causes a slight increase in percent sodium and a decrease in concentration. These changes are due to the fact that Rabbit a~!d Deep Creeks are underlain mostly by the Hell Creek formation. The water quality at Bixby can be compared approximately with the water quality near Faith from the weighted-average figures for the 1949 water year (tables 7 and 8), as both stations were then sampled on a daily basis.
Moreau River near Eagle Butte
Analyses of 13 samples that were collected from April 17, 1941, to July 8, 1943, were furnished by the Bureau of Reclamation. Since November 30, 1945, the Geological Survey has collected samples at irregular intervals. The analytical results for all samples are given in table 9. In general, the water near Eagle Butte contains less sodium than the water at Bixby or

near Faith, but it is more highly mineralized. The change in lithology between Faith and Eagle Butte is the principal reason for the change in water quality.
Moreau River at Promise
Analyses of eight samples that were collected from October 10, 1941, to June 15, 1943, were furnished by the Bureau of Reclamation. Since November 30, 1945, the Geological Survey has collected samples at irregular intervals. The analytical results for all samples are given in table 10.
The composition of the water at Promise is somewhat similar to the composition of the water near Eagle Butte. However, the water at Promise has a higher ratio of calcium and magnesium to sodium.
Suitability of Water for Irrigation
The suitability of water for irrigation, as determined by water-quality criteria only, depends primarily on mineral concentration, percent sodium, and concentration of boron. All these factors may vary considerably with water discharge. Thus, weighted-average analyses by water years are helpful in determining concentrations to be expectedonly if the water is impounded. However, concentrations as shown by these analyses may be misleading because they will be lower or higher during a wet or dry climatic cycle than longterm average concentrations.
For the Moreau River study, relatively short-term chemical-quality records are available. Weighted averages have been calculated from analyses of water samples from the river near Faith (1948 and 1949 water years) and at Bixby (1949, 1950, and 1951 water years) and are given in tables 7 and 8. No other daily chemical-quality stations in the basin have been operated. In order to determine whether the 3-year records for Bixby and the 2-year records for Faith are Â· representative of a wet, dry, or average climatic period, it is necessary to compare the discharge records of these years with a long-term average discharge. As a long-term average discharge is not available for the two stations, it must be calculated after consideration of certain factors, which are (1) the climate throughout the basin is fairly uniform and consequently has a very small variance in average annual precipitation, and (2) the geology and topography are fairly uniform; therefore, the runoff does not vary appreciably'rom one place to another. As a result of these two factors, the discharge per square mile of drainage area is relatively constant for the entire length of the river's main stem, as shown in figure 7. A 21-year record of discharge is available for the station at Promise. Thus, the discharge per square mile at Bixby and Faith canbe calculated withreasonable accuracy for periods when no records of streamflow are available.
The average annual discharge at the Promise station for the 21-year period that ended September 30, 1951, was 273 cfs from the drainage area of 5, 223 square miles. The calculated discharge per square mile equals 0. 052 cfs, which when multiplied by the drainage areas above the other stations gives the approximate 21-year average discharge for each of these 17

areas. Thus, the 21-year average discharge at Bixby (drainage area, 1, 570 sq miles) is about 82 cfs; near Faith (2, 660 sq miles), about 138 cfs; and near Eagle Butte (4, 320 sq miles), about 225 cfs. Discharge for each year of sampling is compared with the 21-year average for each station in table 1. The discharges for several of the years are lower than the calculated 21-year averages. However, the average discharge

for the period of sampling is somewhat higher than the 21-year average. This indicates that the period of sampling was during a relatively wet climatic cycle. Consequently, an average discharge- weighted concentration of dissolved minerals for the period of sampling would be lower than normal, and the percentage composition would not be representative of a long-term average.

Weighted- average concentrations for incomplete years are not necessarily representative of the water that flows past a station during a full year. For example, there were days when the water was not sampled at the Bixby station during the 3-year period of record. The following table compares the estimated weighted averages of specific conductance and percent sodium for 3 complete years of record at Bixby

with the weighted averages for the sampling periods only. From these estimated annual figures, the 3year weighted average for specific conductance would be 632 micromhos and the 3-year weighted average for percent sodium would be 57. The graphic method of rating a water for irrigation as proposed by Wilcox (1948) would rate the water as good to permissible.

The results of analyses of composited samples for the stations at or near Bixby, Faith, Eagle Butte, and Promise have been used to classify graphically the water for irrigation (fig. 11) . In general, the water becomes less suitable as the streamflow decreases. Therefore, if the period of sampling is during a wet

cycle, the short-term weighted averages would imply that the water is of better quality than would actually be available over a long period of time. By correlation of the calculated 21-year average discharge at the Bixby station (82 cfs) with the data given in figure 11, it is estimated that water impounded at Bixby for an

average year would be permissible to doubtful for irrigation. Of course, some years the water would be more suitable for irrigation and some years less suitable than the average would indicate. However, Wilcox states that the graphical classification of irrigation water is dependent on permeability, drainage, quantity of water used, climate, and crops, and that irregularities that relate to any of these would alter the intended use of the graph. Therefore, heavy soils, low permeability, inadequate drainage, high rates of evapotranspiration, the application of too little water, or the growing of crops with poor salt tolerance may alter the classification of the water.
Other chemical-quality characteristics besides total concentration and percent sodium must be considered in rating the water for irrigation. Boron in irrigation water can be toxic to crops if the concentration exceeds the limits suggested by Scofield (1936, p. 286) . Water in the Moreau River usually contains low concentrations of boron, and the higher concentrations during certain low-flow periods would not cause quality-of-water problems if the water were impounded. Eaton (1949, p. 38) states:
... if the water contains more HC03-C03 than it does Ca plus Mg, then with evaporation the Ca and Mg carbonates are precipitated and there remains sodium carbonate, and Na is the only important base. Sincethe strongbase, Na, is present with the excess of carbonate, a weak acid, the solution becomes strongly alkaline. It is the presence or absence of this residual sodium carbonate that now appears to furnish a criterion of whether black alkali can or cannot develop in irrigated soils.
Black-alkali soil is the descriptive name applied to a soil that has a pH of 8. 4 or more and contains organic matter. The organic matter is dissolved by the alkaline solution, and the soil becomes dark brown to black. During certain periods of time, low-flow water at the Bixby station contained amounts of carbonate and bicarbonate. in excess of calcium plus magnesium, as shown in figures 12, 13, and 14. The relation to discharge ofcarbonate and bicarbonate in excess of calcium and magnesium (shown by crosshatching), hydrogen ion concentration, and percent sodium indicates that the excess carbonate and bicarbonate, hydrogen ion concentration, and percent sodium vary inversely with the discharge. However. the decrease of the percent sodium, pH, and excess bicarbonate is not so rapid as the increase of the discharge. Consequently, the concentrations of the constituents may temporarily remain high when the discharge increases. Figures 12, 13, and 14 show that during low flows car-

bonate and bicarbonate are in excess of calcium and magnesium, and the weighted average for the 1951 water year shows an excess because the ratio of flood flows to low flows is low. However, the weighted averages for the 1949 and 1950 wateryears show no excess because the ratio is high. During the 1951 water year the percent sodium was high, and the hydrogen ion concentration (pH} exceeded 8.0 much of the time.
The chemical-quality data for the station at Bixby for the 1951 water year may be used to estimate the water qualityfor previous years. Figure 7 shows that from 1931 to 1940 the discharge per square mile for 6 of the years was less than during 1951, and figure 12 shows that excess carbonate, percent sodium, and pH are all high when water discharges are low. Therefore, during many years of a dry period, such as 1931-40, the water would contain excess amounts of bicarbonate and high percent sodium, and the pH would probably exceed 8. 0. This water would be conducive to the formation of black alkali.
Eaton (1949, 1950) has made an extensive study of the relations of residual carbonate and percent sodium to the occurrence of black alkali and the suitability for irrigation of water in the Nile River basin. His findings are applicable to any natural water that may be used for irrigation. He stated (1949, p. 38-39):
During period of low water the Nile water has a pH well above 8.0. The water has such a large proportion of HC03-C03 that when it is greatly reduced in volume by evaporation it precipitates much of its Ca and Mg as carbonates and silicates, giving rise to an alkaline solution. with little else than sodium salts of carbonate, chloride, and sulfate. Such a solution washing onto a soil from neighboring land, or rising from below and moving Â·through it, would bring about the replacement of exchangeable calcium and magnesium, produce a high pH, establish impermeability, and, in other words, create those conditions that are descriptive of black-alkali soils .... If the possibility of black-alkali formation can be anticipated by recognition of the ionic relations of the water supply, advantage can be taken of the facts, not necessarily as a basis for condemning a water, but rather as a means of establishing the need of precautionary measures. Productivity can be maintained by adequate water use and drainage at less expense than it can be restored by reclamation.
In the following table, a comparison is shown between the composition of waters of the Moreau River during the 1951 water year and of the Nile River during 8 months of low flow.

The quality of the water in the Moreau River at Bixby is so poor for irrigation that a complete evaluation of soil, permeability, drainage, climate, application rates, and crops is necessary. During the dry periods of the climatic cycle, when irrigation would be needed most, the water quality is very poor.
The use of the water for irrigation is not precluded where adequate drainage is provided and where infiltration rates are sufficient to provide low rates of evaporation and good flushing.
Downstream from Bixby the water becomes progressively better for irrigation. However, the improvement is not great by the time the water reaches the station near Faith. Data are inadequate to foretell satisfactorily the suitability for irrigation of the water at the stations near Eagle Butte and at Promise. Available data (tables 9 and 10) seem to indicate that the percent sodium is lower and amounts of carbonate and bicarbonate in excess of calcium and magnesium are much less likely to be troublesome than in the water at upstream stations.
FLUVIAL SEDIMENT
Information on the sediment yield of a drainage basin should include rates and quantities of discharge of all the sediment that is transported either in suspension or as bed load, the particle-size distribution of the suspended sediment and of the bed load, and the principal sources of the sediment. This report contains only the measured rates and quantities of suspended sediment and the results of particle-size analyses of suspended sediments.
Stream slopes are low and the particle sizes of the suspended sediment are small, so bed-load discharge must be low. Also few data are available for computing rates and quantities of sediment that is discharged as bed load. For these reasons the bed-load discharge of the Moreau River was not computed.
Definition of Terms
As the definitions of terms that relate to fluvial sediments are not completely standardized, some of the terms in this report are defined as follows:
Sediment is fragmental material that originates from weathering of rocks and is transported by, suspended in, or deposited by water or air or is accumulated in beds by other natural agencies.
Fluvial sediment is sediment that is transported by, .suspended in, or deposited by water.
Suspended sediment or suspended load is sediment that moves in suspension in water and is maintained in suspension by the upward components of turbulent currents or by colloidal suspension.
Bed load or sediment discharged as bed load includes both the sediment that moves in essentially continuous contact with the stream bed (contact load) and the material that bounces along the bed in short skips or leaps (saltation load) .

Sediment sample is a quantity of water-sediment mixture that is collected to represent the average concentration of suspended sediment, the average size distribution of suspended or deposited sediment, or the specific weight of deposited sediment.
Depth-integrated sediment sample is a sediment sample that is accumulated continuously in a sampler that moves vertically at a constant transit rate and that admits sediment-water mixture at a velocity about equal to the stream velocity at every point. Because depth-integrated sediment samplers are not designed to collect water-sediment mixture within about 0.3 foot of the stream bed, the suspended-sediment discharge based on such samples is less than the total suspendedsediment discharge. However, for sediment in the silt and clay sizes, the difference is usually negligible. As the suspended sediments of the Moreau River are nearlyall smaller than sand size, the term "suspended-sedimentdischarge" is applied to the sediment discharge that is computed from depth-integrated sediment samples.
Sediment discharge is the rate at which dry weight of sediment passes a section of a stream or is the quantity of sediment, as measured by dry weight or by volume, that is discharged in a given time.
Specific weight of sediment is weight of solids per unit volume of deposit in place.
The size classification used in this report is the classification recommended by the American Geophysical Union Subcommittee on sediment terminology (Lane, 1947, p. 937). According to this classification, clay size particles have diameters between 0. 0002 and 0. 004 millimeter, silt size particles have diameters between 0. 004 and 0. 062 millimeter, and sand size particles have diameters between 0. 062 and 2. 0 millimeters.
According to Twenhofel and Tyler (1941, p. 110):
The median, or median diameter, is the midpoint in the size distribution of a sediment of which one-half of the weight is composed of particles larger in diameter than the median and one-half of smaller diameter. The median diameter may be read directly from the cumulative curve by noting the diameter value at the point of intersection of the 50 percent line and the curve.
Water discharge is the discharge of natural water of a stream. The natural water contains both dissolved solids and suspended sediment.
Measurement of Suspended-Sediment Discharge
Discharge of suspended sediment is proportional to the product of water discharge and average concentration of suspended sediment. Procedures for gaging the flow of streams are fairly well standardized and are explained in Water-SupplyPaper 888 (Corbett, 1943).
Concentration of suspended sediment in the Moreau River basin was determined usually from depth-integrated samples. These samples were collected either

24

with the US DH-48 hand sampler or with the US D-43 sampler. A bucket-type sampler was used when no better sampler was available or when the air temperatures were too low for a sampler with a nozzle.

At each sediment sampling station, samples were collecte_d generally at one vertical in the stream cross section, called the daily sampling station, once or twice a day except during periods of high or rapidly changing concentration or discharge when samples were taken more frequently. Engineers collected additional samples periodically at the daily sampling stations. Usually they also sampled at a few verticals that were spaced to represent equal quantities of water discharge. The average concentration of the samples from these verticals was used as the average concentration of suspended sediment for the entire cross section. At some measuring stations, the average concentration for the cross section sometimes differed significantly from the simultaneous concentration at the daily sampling station. For such stations, corrections were applied to adjust concentrations.that were based on samples at the daily sampling station to average concentrations for the cross section.

The concentration of suspended sediment in each sample was determined in the laboratory. First, each sample was weighed. Then, after the sediment had settled, the supernatant water was drawn off. The residue was filtered or evaporated, and the sediment was dried and weighed. Corrections were applied for any appreciable quantity of dissolved solids that remained with the sediment after the water was evaporated

Daily mean concentrations of suspended sediment were computed by plotting the concentrations of samples from the daily sampling station on the gage-height graph, drawing a smooth curve through the plotted points, and picking the daily mean concentrations for the daily sampling station from this graph. If the concentrations at the daily sampling station were not representative of the concentration for the entire cross section of the stream, a coefficient was applied to compute the daily mean concentrations.

,

Discharge of suspended sediment in tons per day usually was computed by multiplying daily concentration, in parts per million, by daily mean water discharge, in cubic feet per second, and by 0. 0027. On days when both concentration and water discharge were

changing rapidly, each day was subdivided, and sediment discharge was computed for parts of the day. For days when no samples were collected, the daily discharges of suspended sediment were estimated on the basis of water discharge, concentration for adjacent days, weather records, and records for other stations.
Suspended-Sediment Records
Daily records of suspended-sediment discharge of the Moreau River have been obtained and computed for the gaging station near Faith from August 15, 1946, to September 30, 1949, and for the gaging station at Bixby from April 28, 1949, to September 30, 1951. Sediment samples were also collected at Bixby on March 24 and April 13, 1949. The locations of the sediment stations at Bixby and near Faith are shown on figure 1 (map reference nos. 10 and 16).
Table 2 is a summary of the more detailed record (tables 11 and 12) of suspended-sediment discharge for Â·the two stations. The average concentration weighted with water discharge was about 3, 700 ppm for the station near Faith and about 4, 600 ppm for the station at Bixby. The difference in average concentration at the two stations is due mostly to having sediment records during the water year of 1950 at Bixby but not at Faith. During the water year of 1950, the streamflow of the Moreau River was 2~ to 3 times normal. At the station near Faith the suspended-sediment discharge averaged about 650, 000 tons per year during the period of record or slightly less than 250 tons per square miles annually. Water discharge during this period averaged somewhat less than 130, 000 acre-feet annually. The Moreau River at Bixby discharged about 1,000,000 tons of suspended sediment and about 160,000 acre-feet of water during the water year of 1950 but only about 80,000 tons and 16,000 acre-feet during the water year of 1951. Sediment yield per square mile averaged nearly 350 tons per year. Available records are for too short a time to prove that the average sediment yield per square mile is appreciably different at the station at Bixby than at the station near Faith. As soils, topography, vegetation, precipitation, and runoff all seem to be about uniform throughout the Moreau River basin, the sediment yields per square mile are probably reasonably uniform within the basin except in small areas of badlands or active gullies.

Suspended- sediment discharge fluctuates with changes in any one of several interrelated variables, which include water discharge, turbulence and temperature of the flowing water, and availability of sediments of each size range. The fluctuations are large and frequent and have only a general relation to water discharge. Except, perhaps, at very high water discharges, the suspended-sediment discharge generally increases more rapidly than the water discharge because the concentration also tends to increase with water discharge. Throughout much of the range covered by the records, the suspended- sediment discharge increases approximately as the square of the water discharge. (See figs. 15 and 16, which show the relation of daily discharges of suspended sediment to water discharge.) In general, for a given water discharge, concentrations of suspended sediment are much lower during the spring than at other seasons of the year.
Size Composition of Suspended Sediment
At the sediment sampling stations at Bixby and near Faith, representative samples were collected periodically for particle-size analyses. (See tables 13 and 14.) One or both of two general types ofparticle-size distributions were determined from a sample. One type showed partiele sizes according to settling velocities in native water in which the degree of flocculation may have been somewhat the same as might occur in a pool or reservoir. The other type of particlesize distribution was the classification of particles by their settling diameters when the particles were completely dispersed. For particle sizes smaller than 0.031 millimeter, the difference between the two types of particle-size distributions is large. The difference is due to flocculation of the soil particles, which is caused by certain dissolved solids in the native water. A11erage size distributions of samples for which duplicate portions were analyzed in native water and in distilled water are plotted on figures 17 and 18. Also plotted on these figures are the curves of average particle-size distributions for all samples that were analyzed in distilled water. All average particle sizes are simply arithmetic averages of the size distributions of the particles; that is, particle sizes were not weighted with sediment discharge except that more samples were collected for particle-size analyses during periods of high flow than during periods of low flow.

deposited while the particles were dispersed. Also the available data for defining the relation between median particle size of deposited sediments and specific weight were obtained from samples that were analyzed usually when the particles were dispersed.
Until 1950 the particle-size analyses, both in native and in distilled water, were made with the bottomwithdrawal tube. During 1950 and 1951 many samples were analyzed for particle size by the sieve-pipette method (Twenhofel and Tyler, 1941, p. 54-55). In this method particles coarser than 0. 062 millimeter are separated from the finer particles by a combination of wet and dry sieving. The coarser portion is then weighed and discarded or is subdivided into different size classifications by dry sieving. The finer portion is analyzed according to sedimentation diameters by the pipette method.
The suspended sediment transported by the Moreau River is mostly fine material. (See figs. 17 and 18.) The average percentage of particles in the sand range (0.062 to 2.0 mm) was 10 percent at Bixby and 6 percent for the station near Faith. The larger percentage of coarser particles at Bixby probably was due to the abnormally high water discharges during 1950. Median particle sizes as shown by the average sizes of the dispersed samples were, by extrapolation, about 0. 0017 millimeter for the station at Bixby and about 0. 0015 millimeter for the station near Faith (figs. 17 and 18). The samples were not weighted with water discharge or sediment discharge.
Specific Â·weight of Fluvial Sediment
One significant factor in the design of reservoirs is the rate of depletion of storage capacity by sediment deposits. Estimates of the rate of reservoir depletion should be based on a knowledge of the probable location and specific weight of the deposited sediments. The location of the deposited sediments is dependent on inflow-outflow relationships or elevation of water surface in the reservoir, sedimentation diameter of particles in transport, mineral constituents in solution, and effect of density currents. The specific weight of sediment deposits depends on the type of material in transport, absolute particle size, effect of change in concentration of the mineral constituents in solution, degree of sorting, and amount of consolidation.

and (3) the cementation and compaction to which the deposit has been subjected since its deposition. The degree of assortment is particularly important in fixing porosity. Sediment ofcompletelyuniform particle size (perfectly graded sediment) will have the greatest porosity. If all particles were uniform spheres. the size of the particles would have no effect on the porosity of uniform deposits. However. deposits of silts and clays usually have greater porosity and smaller specific weight than deposits of coarser particles. partly because the range in particle size is usually greater in coarser deposits and partly because the smaller particles fill some pores between the larger particles.
The specific weight is increased and the volume of a sediment deposit is decreased as part of the interstitial water is forced out and as the sediment particles become packedcloser together. The smaller the pore spaces. the greater are the friction and other forces that resist compaction of the sediment. Hence. fine-grained deposits usually compact at a much slower rate than coarse -grained deposits. The rate and amount of increase of specific weight depend not only on the particle size of the deposits but also on the method of operation of the reservoir and on the depth of the sediment deposits. The rate of compaction is probably relatively rapid during the first few years after deposition but decreases with time.
An average figure for the specific weight of a deposit that might be formed from the sediment in transport is necessary to compute the space that a given tonnage of the sediment might occupy when first deposited in a reservoir. The accuracy of such a computed average figure is affected not only by reservoir operation but also by inaccuracies in measuring the total sediment discharge and the particle sizes. At present only the suspended sediment is measured; the bed load must be estimated. Hence, only an approximate figure can be computed for the average specific weight that the sediment deposit will have SQOn after it accumulates in a reservoir.

The specific weight of suspended sediment was determined by a method that is based on the median particle size of the suspended sediment. This method is believed to be superior to others that apply specific weights to different size grades because it is simple and is based on actual measurements of specific weights.
This method is as follows: The median particle size of each sample that was analyzed in a dispersed state was plotted against the instantaneous suspendedsediment discharge in tons per day. (See fig. 19.) For predetermined class intervals of suspended-sediment discharge. the corresponding median particle sizes were taken from the curve of figure 19 and were listed in tables 3 and 4.
Figure 20 shows the relation between the median particle size and the specific weight of relatively uncompacted sediment deposits in reservoirs in the United States (Hembree and others. 1952, p. 83-85). The specific weights corresponding to the different median particle sizes that are listed in tables 3 and 4 were determined from figure 20. The specific weight of reservoir deposits that might be formed from the suspended sediment in the Moreau River at Bixby and near Faith was then computed (tables 3 and 4) and was found to be 51 and 50 pounds per cubic foot. respectively. These specific weights. which are for sediment deposits that have not been compacted during a long period of time or under the weight of appreciable amounts of overlying deposits, were used to convert tons of suspended sediment to acre-feet of sediment. (See table 5.) The computed volumes of sediment indicate that the probable maximum space that would be occupied by the suspended sediment that was discharged by the Moreau River at Bixby from April 28, 1949. to September 30, 1951, would be about 980 acrefeet and near Faith from August 15. 1946. to September 30, 1949. would be about 1. 820 acre-feet. Flow of the Moreau River was probably appreciably above normal during the period of sediment records for the station near Faith and probably averaged much above normal during the period of sediment records at Bixby.

SUMMARY
Soils, climate, and vegetation are fairly uniform throughout the Moreau River basin. The exposed rocks are ofCretaceous and Tertiaryage. The Moreau River is a meandering intermittent stream that flows in a shifting, sandy-bottomed channel.
Runoff from the basin averages about 0. 7 inch per year and has been about uniform over the basin during the period of streamflow records. Some of the runoff comes from melting of snow, but most of it probably comes from rains during late spring and early summer.
The chemical quality of the water in the Moreau River and tributaries is dependent on and directly related to the lithologic character of the exposed rocks of the Pierre shale, Fox Hills sandstone, and the Hell Creek formation. Water that drains from areas underlain by the HellCreek formation and Fox Hills sandstone contains predominantly sodium bicarbonate, whereas water from areas underlain by Pierre shale contains predominantly sodium sulfate.

Samples collected daily or infrequently at four places on the main stem and single samples collected from the tributaries for a special salinity study show the relationship between quality of water and geology and also the effects of tributary flow on the water in the main stem. The complexity of the water quality is shown by extremes in concentration and rapid changes in composition.
The suitability of the water for irrigation is determined from relatively short-term records by comparison with long-term discharge records, consideration of the significance of the calculated weighted averages, and consideration of certain ionic relationships. On the basis of concentration and percent soaium, the water in the Moreau River at Bixby is classed as permissible to doubtful for irrigation. On the basis of the ratio of bicarbonate to calcium plus magnesium, percent sodium, and hydrogen ion concentration, the water is conducive to the formation of black alkali on soils during dry periods. The quality of the water of the Moreau River is so poor that all other pertinent factors must be considered before t-he water is used for irrigation.

During 3 complete water years immediately preceding October 1, 1949, the discharge of suspended sediment of the Moreau River averaged about 650,000 tons annually at the gaging station near Faith and was transported by an annual water discharge of about 130,000 acre-feet. During the water years of 1950 and 1951, the Moreau River at Bixby discharged about 1,080,000 tons of suspended sediment and 170,000 acre-feet of water. About 90 percent of this discharge of sediment and water occurred during the water year of 1950 when the streamflow was nearly three times the normal. Sediment yields per square mile may be no greater at Bixby than at the station near Faith.
Suspended sediment transportep by the Moreau River is mostly fine material. The averages of median particle sizes (not weighted with water discharge) were, by extrapolation, about 0. 0017 millimeter for the station at Bixby and. about 0. 0015 millimeter for the station near Faith. Only 6 percent of the suspended sediment for the station near Faith and only 10 percent of the suspended sediment for the station at Bixby were coarser than the lower limit of the sand sizes, 0:062 millimeter.
Low channel slopes and small particle sizes indicate that bed-load discharge would be only a small percentage of total sediment discharge, but bed-load discharge was not computed because too few data were available.
Particle sizes of the suspended sediment of the Moreau River at Bixby and near Faith indicate specific weights of 51 and 50 pounds per cubic foot, respectively, for deposits that might form in a reservoir without being compacted over long periods of time or under the weight of appreciable quantities of overlying deposits. On the basis of these specific weights, the suspended sediment discharged at the station at Bixby from April 28, 1949, to September 30, 1951, would occupy a volume of about 980 acre-feet, and the suspended sediment discharged at the station near Faith from August 15, 1946, to September 30, 1949, would occupy about 1, 820 acre-feet of space.
