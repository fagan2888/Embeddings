ABSTRACT:

This report presents a map showing the potentiometric surface of the

Lower Patapsco aquifer in the Patapsco Formation of Cretaceous age in Southern

Maryland during September 1998. The map was prepared from water-level

measurements in 68 wells. The potentiometric surface was 87 feet above sea

level near the northwestern boundary and outcrop area of the aquifer in a

topographically high area of Anne Arundel County, and 111 feet above sea level

in a similar setting in Prince Georges County. From these high areas, the

potentiometric surface declined towards large well fields at Crofton,

Severndale, Arnold, and Annapolis. The ground-water levels declined to 56 feet

below sea level at Crofton, 74 feet below sea level at Severndale, 59 feet

below sea level at Arnold, and 34 feet below sea level west of Annapolis.

There was also a cone of depression covering a large area including Waldorf,

LaPlata, Indian Head and the Morgantown powerplant. The ground-water levels

were as low as 175 feet below sea level at Waldorf, 105 feet below sea level

at LaPlata, 113 feet below sea level at Indian Head, and 80 feet below sea

level at the Morgantown powerplant.
