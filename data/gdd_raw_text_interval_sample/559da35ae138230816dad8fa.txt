INTRODUCTION
In July of 1985 and 1986, the U.S. Geological Survey conducted a small-scale coal investigation at Sagwon Bluffs, near Sagwon, Alaska, which is about 66 mi south of Prudhoe Bay on the Sagavanirktok River (fig. 1). This report presents the analytical results for nine coal samples collected by the authors from outcrops at Sagwon Bluffs. Figure 2 shows the approximate locations of the collected coal samples, which were fresh (trenched to permafrost) channel samples (fig. 3).
The U.S. Geological Survey analyzed each coal sample for major, minor, and trace elements. Figure 4 schematically portrays the procedures for analysis in the Reston, Virginia, laboratory. Supplemental samples of the roof and floor rock and major partings were also collected at coal sample sites, but were not analyzed due to budgetary limits. Proximate and ultimate analyses for these coal samples will be available in the future.

GEOLOGIC SETTING

Gryc and others (1951) named the Sagavanirktok Formation for a sequence of siltstone, sandstone, conglomerate, and lignite exposed at Franklin Bluffs, which is north of Sagwon on the Sagavanirktok River (fig. 1). Due to considerable confusion surrounding the stratigraphic limits of the formation, Detterman and others (1975) included all beds above the Cretaceous Prince Creek Formation and below the Quaternary Gubik Formation in the Sagavanirktok Fm (fig. 5). They also divided the formation into three formal members: in ascending order, the Sagwon, Franklin Bluffs, and Nuwok Members. Each member has a unique location for its type section, as no single exposure of the Sagavanirktok Fm. contains a complete sequence (fig. 5). Sagwon (no. 1, fig. 5) and Franklin Bluffs (no. 2) are the respective locations for the lower two members. Carter Creek (no. 3) is the type locality for the Nuwok Member.

The Sagwon Member is the only member of the formation that contains coal. The type section, 143 m (470 ft) thick (no. 1, fig. 5), starts on the west side of the Sagavanirktok River and continues south for about 1.6 km (1 mi) along the bluff. It consists of shale, siltstone, sandstone, conglomerate, carbonaceous shale, and lignite (Detterman and others, 1975). Detterman and others (1975) also reported that crossbedding of the shallow-water to deltaic type is common in both sandstone and conglomerate and indicates a source area to the southwest. Limited spore-pollen assemblages in four samples from above and below the two major coal units suggest a restricted lowland, nonmarine environment with relatively little detrital material influx. The low diversity palynomorphs found are:

Upper coal - roof sample

Middle coal - roof sample

Laevigatosporites sp. Sphagnumsporites sp. Alnipollenites sp. Paraalnipollenites confusus floor sample Laevigatosporites sp. Alnipollenites sp. ?Paraalnipollenites confusus

Deltoidospora sp. Osmundacidites sp. Alnipollenites sp. Cicatricosisporites sp. floor sample Deltoidospora sp. Lvcopodiumsporites sp. Alnipollenites sp. ?Cicatricosisporites sp. Multicellaesporites sp. (fungal spore) ?Microthyriacites sp. (fungal spore)

Fossil flora date the member as Paleocene in age. The lower contact of the Sagwon Member with the underlying Cretaceous Prince Creek Fm. is conformable. Both the upper Prince Creek Fm. and the Sagwon Member contain coal and consist of poorly consolidated rock. However, the coal of the Prince Creek is thought to be a higher rank (Detterman and others, 1975). The upper contact with terrace gravel is unconformable.

COAL SAMPLES AND ANALYSES
Samples SAG2-11-1 and SAG2-19-2 are grab samples collected in 1985 and represent the middle and upper coal beds, respectively. Samples SBTL1-E and F and SBTU2-A through E also represent the middle and upper coal beds collected in 1986 at Sagwon Bluffs. The 1986 samples are continuous channel samples taken from deeply trenched exposures similar to the one shown in figure 3 and correspond to drill holes #10 (middle coal) and #7 (upper coal), as reported by Roberts and others (1988).
The USGS Analytical Lab assigns its own sample number to each coal sample with no reference to the collector's field id. The list on page 9 equates the field id, assigned sample number, and other descriptive information about the nine coal samples, such as latitude/longitude, name of coal bed, sampled thickness, etc.
All data in tables 1, 2, and 3 are reported by the assigned sample number, not the field id: Table 1 lists oxide data on an ash basis; Table 2 lists trace element data on whole-coal basis; and Table 3 lists major, minor, and trace element composition on whole-coal basis. Tables 4a and 4b are statistical listings for trace elements and oxides for the nine coal samples.
