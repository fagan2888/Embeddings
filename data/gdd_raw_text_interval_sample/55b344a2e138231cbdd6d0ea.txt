PALYNOLOGY OF SELECTED COAL BEDS IN THE PROPOSED PENNSYLVANIAN SYSTEM STRATOTYPE IN WEST VIRGINIA

By ROBERT M. KOSANKE

ABSTRACT
The usefulness of Pennsylvania!! palynomorphs, spores, and pollen grains, as an aid in coal-correlation investigations in the Appalachians, has been known for many years. However, much of this and subsequent information was scattered in the literature or was not from the proposed stratotype area of West Virginia Investigation of coals from sections of the proposed Pennsylvanian System stratotype provided the opportunity to examine changes in palynomorph content through a number of coals from the New River Formation to the basal part of the Monongahela Formation.
The rank of most coals of the Pocahontas and New River Formations of West Virginia does not permit extraction of palynomorphs with current laboratory maceration techniques. Because of this, the data of some possibly equivalent lower rank Pennsylvanian coals from adjacent parts of southern Ohio and eastern Kentucky have been included. The coals examined from the Kanawha Formation, Charleston Sandstone, and Monongahela Formations of West Virginia have yielded abundant and well-preserved palynomorphs. Attention has been focused on the Charleston Sandstone, which is a massive, complex unit lacking marine fossils and composed primarily of sandstone. The coal is a significant resource in Pennsylvanian rocks, and the correlation of coals is an important consideration in the area of the stratotype in West Virginia and in adjacent States.
As a result of this preliminary examination, the approximate range zones of some important taxa have been established. These range zones together with abundance data are used to correlate the coals. The range zones of some important taxa from Lower to Upper Pennsylvanian coals are: Densosporites irregularis Hacquebard and Barss, Stenozonotriletes lycosporoides (Butterworth and Williams) Smith and Butterworth, Schulzospora raw. Kosanke, Laevigatosporites spp., Radiizonates spp., Torispora securis Balme, Zosterosporites triangularis Kosanke, Thymospora pseudothiessenii (Kosanke) Wilson and Venkatachala, Schopfites dimorphus Kosanke, and Thymospora thiessenii (Kosanke) Wilson and Venkatachala Some of the range zones are relatively short and extremely useful for correlation studies. For example, in the Charleston Sandstone, T. pseudothiessenii (Kosanke) Wilson and Venkatachala is present in the Upper No. 5 Block coal (upper bench) and the No. 6 Block coal, whereas Schopfites dimorphus Kosanke is restricted to the No. 6 Block coal. Thymospora thiessenii (Kosanke) Wilson and Venkatachala is not restricted to the Pittsburgh No. 8 coal, but it is the only coal known in which this taxon is so dominant (more than 70 percent of the palynomorph assemblage).
This preliminary report has provided a framework for the correlation of a selected number of coals occurring in Ohio and eastern Kentucky with those of the proposed Pennsylvanian System stratotype

of West Virginia In other studies, additional samples from the stratotype would be examined for ultimate correlation with rocks of Pennsylvania and in adjacent States and elsewhere.
INTRODUCTION
The need for a stratotype section of Pennsylvanian rocks has been indicated by boundary and correlation problems. Theoretically, an ideal stratotype section would contain a complete depositional sequence of rocks from oldest to youngest. This requirement was met in West Virginia despite the fact that the alternation of marine and nonmarine deposition does not extend throughout the stratotype section. The presence of widespread coals in the stratotype section suggested that palynomorphs have an important role to play in defining the stratotype. Many of the coals in West Virginia are exposed in the rocks of the proposed Pennsylvanian System stratotype (fig. 1). Pennsylvanian rocks of the proposed stratotype section start with the Lower Pennsylvanian Series near Bluefield, W. Va., at the position of the Bramwell Member of the Bluestone Formation, and continue north-northwest through the Middle and Upper Pennsylvanian Series into the Dunkard Basin of northwestern West Virginia, southeastern Ohio, and southwestern Pennsylvania.
Although coal is abundant in West Virginia, not all of the coal is amenable to maceration because it is of high rank. Palynomorphs are altered by coalification from translucent to opaque entities in high-rank coal, so they have little value for palynological studies. Palynomorphs in coals in the Pocahontas Formation and the lower half of the New River Formation generally appear to be in this category.
Figure 2 illustrates some of the Lower Pennsylvanian strata from the stratotype examined for palynomorphs. Lower Pennsylvanian strata that may be in part equivalent to the lower part of the stratotype section occur in adjacent southeastern Ohio and eastern Kentucky. Coal

in these two areas is of lower rank and is readily some of these data to correlate with the stratotype secamenable to maceration, so that excellent assemblages tion. These data are discussed subsequently under of palynomorphs were recovered. I decided to include palynomorph assemblages from Ohio and Kentucky.

from the University of West Virginia have investigated the palynomorph content of various coals of West Virginia.
Thiessen and his associates conducted fundamental studies of Appalachian and other coals, with much of their effort directed toward quantitative coal petrology. The coal thin-section method of study was employed by Thiessen, and according to Schopf and Oftedahl (1976), the Thiessen coal thin-section slide collection consists of more than 19,000 slides from 682 different localities in the United States and elsewhere, with nearly one-third of these localities occurring within the Appalachian Basin. Observations reported by Thiessen on the occurrence and distribution of spores found in coal thin sections during his petrology studies were the first recognition in the United States of the potential value of these fossils for coal-correlation investigations. Some of the observations by Thiessen were cited by Kosanke (1943).

SAMPLE METHODS, PREPARATION, AND LOCALITIES

Cross (1947) and later Cross and Schemel (1952) began a reconnaissance of coals of West Virginia. Schemel (1957) completed a Ph. D. dissertation on West Virginia coal, Clendening published a series of papers that were largely concerned with palynomorphs from strata of the Dunkard Group, and the dates of these publications have been cited.

All samples were assigned laboratory maceration numbers and all productive samples were also assigned USGS paleobotanical locality numbers (D numbers). The stratigraphic nomenclature used in this paper follows that of Englund and others (1979).
The following samples from West Virginia, Ohio, and Kentucky were studied in this investigation:

ACKNOWLEDGMENTS
A number of people assisted in the collection of samples used in this investigation, for which I am most grateful. K. J. Englund, H. H. Arndt, and T. W. Henry helped with the collection of samples from the proposed Pennsylvanian System stratotype in West Virginia. D. C. Alvord provided samples of the Cedar Grove and Winifrede coals from their respective type localities in West Virginia. H. R. Collins and C. L. Rice provided samples from Ohio, and the late Don E. Wolcott assisted in the collection of samples from Kentucky. Mark A. Mercer and John R. Scholten assisted with the preparation of samples, and Scholten prepared many of the original illustrations. This help is gratefully acknowledged. Appreciation is extended to G. K. Guennel of Marathon Oil company, who reviewed the manuscript.
SAMPLE METHODS, PREPARATION, AND LOCALITIES
The aim of the sampling method was to obtain a representative sample whenever possible for the coal units and other lithologies. For example, ribbon samples were cut from diamond-drill cores with a carborundum saw, and column samples were taken from mine and outcrop exposures of coal. The usual maximum vertical thickness of samples was set at 30.48 cm. Roof rock, partings, and seat rock were sampled separately. For a discussion of this type of sampling, see Kosanke (1977) and Schopf (1960).
The coal samples were prepared according to procedures described by Kosanke (1950, 1973), the only modification being the use of HNO3 (90 percent concentration) for high-rank coal in place of HNO3 (70 percent concentration). Precise preparation methods used for each maceration are recorded in maceration books of the Denver Palynological Laboratories, U.S. Geological Survey.
One hundred thirty-four samples of roof rock, coal, partings, seat rock, and shale samples were collected. One hundred three samples were from the proposed Pennsylvanian System stratotype section in West Virginia, 14 samples were from southern Ohio, and 17 samples were from eastern Kentucky.

PALYNOMORPH ASSEMBLAGES FROM THE PROPOSED PENNSYLVANIAN STRATOTYPE SECTION OF WEST VIRGINIA
UPPER MISSISSIPPIAN AND LOWER PENNSYLVANIAN SERIES
BLUESTONE AND POCAHONTAS FORMATIONS
Figure 5, modified from Englund and others (1977), illustrates a section along State Route 102 at Bluestone, W. Va., from which two samples were collected and assigned to the maceration series 517. Maceration 517-A is from the Bramwell Member as shown on figure 5, whereas maceration 517-B is from the lower part of the Pocahontas Formation. Maceration 517-A did not yield palynomorphs, perhaps because the Bramwell Member is largely of marine origin. Neuropteris pocahontas White, however, occurs in the upper part of the Bramwell Member at this locality. Maceration 517-B was productive, and although the color of the palynomorphs indicates considerable thermal alteration, even so, a few were identified from a single slide as follows:
Ahrensisporites sp. Densosporites irregularis Hacquebard and Barss
(five specimens) D. sp. Dictyotriletes (?) sp. Granulatisporites sp. Lycospora spp. (seven specimens) Four additional samples of the Bluestone and Pocahontas Formations were collected along State Route 10 near Garwood, W. Va., as shown on figure 6. These samples were assigned to the 518 maceration

series as 518-A-D. Samples 518-C-D from the upper tongue of the Bluestone Formation were barren of palynomorphs. Samples 518-A-B are from the Pocahontas Formation; 518-A was barren of palynomorphs, but 518-B contained poorly preserved specimens of Densosporites and Lycospora.
NEW RIVER FORMATION
The Sewell coal occurs approximately in the middle of the New River Formation (fig. 2). This coal averages about 0.9 m in thickness and is primarily a low-volatile coal; a few analyses have reported as much as 34 percent volatile matter, placing such samples in the highvolatile range and presumably making them more amenable to maceration. Two sets of samples of the Sewell coal were collected.
The first set of samples was collected from the Royal Coal Company No. 5 mine, 2.5 km northeast of Fayetteville, W. Va., along the west side of the New River gorge, north of Marr Branch, Fayette County, Fayetteville quadrangle. These samples (macerations 431-A-E) did not respond to normal maceration procedures even though they were weathered. However, the use of HNO3 (90 percent concentration) produced results, which are shown in table 1. Although palynomorphs were reasonably abundant, no statistical counts were made because of the uncertainty of species identification in a number of instances. The palynomorphs recovered from these samples of the Sewell coal (431-A-E) are translucent despite a brownish hue. Sixteen genera have been identified from these samples, and in addition, two specimens observed in maceration series 431-C were questionably assigned to Laevigatosporites. Lycospora appears to be dominant in all of the samples of maceration 431-A-E, followed by Densosporites.
The other set of samples of the Sewell coal (macerations 543-A-D) was collected near the New River Bridge along State Route 82, at the junction with the Royal Coal Company No. 5 mine road. The Sewell coal is 0.9 m thick and somewhat weathered at this locality. Even though 90 percent HNO3 was used on these samples, they did not yield palynomorphs. This suggests that either the samples were not as deeply weathered as those of series 431 (weathering of coals often assists the maceration process) or they were of higher rank. The seat-rock sample (maceration 543-D) does contain abundant and reasonably well preserved spores and pollen grains, and despite a brownish color they are translucent. This assemblage is limited in diversity; only the following taxa were identified:
Calamospora sp. Cirratriradites sp.

PALYNOLOGY OF COAL BEDS IN THE PROPOSED PENNSYLVANIAN STRATOTYPE, WEST VIRGINIA

Crassispora kosankei (Potonie and Kremp) Bharadwaj
Granulatisporites sp. Lophotriletes sp. Lycospora granulata Kosanke Lycospora pellucida (Wicher) Schopf, Wilson,
and Bentall L. pseudoannulata Kosanke1 L. spp. Punctatisporites sp.
Wanless (1939) correlated the Sewell coal of West Virginia with the Sharon No. 1 coal of Ohio. Although the assemblage of palynomorphs recovered from the Sewell coal is limited, nothing so far identified from the Sewell coal is in conflict with the assemblage of palynomorphs recovered from the Sharon No. 1 coal of
1Lycospora pellucida (Wicher) Schopf, Wilson, and Bentall andL. pseudoannulata Kosanke, for purposes of this report, are regarded as a single entity. Unquestionably, the holotype specimens of these two species are distinct taxa It is also certain that consistency in identification is made difficult by preservational factors and by different preparation treatments required to free palynomorphs from high-rank coals. Because of this and the fact that separation of these two taxa does not play an important part in this investigation, the two are recorded as one entity.

Ohio. Wanless (1939) correlated the Sewell and Sharon No. 1 coal with the Barren Fork coal of eastern Kentucky. The Barren Fork coal, which occurs above the Rockcastle Conglomerate Member, is definitely younger than the Sewell and Sharon coals; and this will be discussed subsequently under palynomorph assemblages from Ohio and eastern Kentucky.

KANAWHA FORMATION
A number of coals from the Kanawha Formation the Lower Douglas(?), the Gilbert(?), the Cedar Grove, the Winifrede, and the Stockton were examined. Their position within the Kanawha Formation is shown on figure 3.
The Lower Douglas(?) coal was collected near the base of the Kanawha Formation (macerations 432-A-C). The collecting site is east of the New River Bridge just northwest of Lansing, Fayette County, W. Va. Metamorphism has greatly altered the appearance of many

palynomorphs resulting in the color intensification of individual ornamentation elements. The dark-brown color of the elements is especially well shown, for example, in the muri of Dictyotriletes or the grana of Crassispora, Two-thirds of the assemblage of macerations 432-B-C is assignable to Lycospora, as shown in table 2. Densosporites annulatus (Loose) Schopf, Wilson, and Bentall is abundant and restricted to the top of the coal. The dominant genera of the Lower Douglas(?) coal (macerations 432-B-C) are as follows:

Densosporites Granulatisporites Laevigatosporites Lycospora

15.5 percent 3.9 6.3 66.6
90.3 percent

Accessory taxa include Dictyotriletes castaneaeformis (Horst) Sullivan and Stenozonotriletes bracteolus (Butterworth and Williams) Smith and Butterworth.
The Gilbert(?) coal, macerations 433-A-C, was collected 49 m above the base of the Kanawha Formation along Cane Branch road south of Cane Branch, Fayette

County, W. Va. The coal is 44.4 cm thick (see table 3). The color of the palynomorphs in the Gilbert coal is much more normal than in the Lower Douglas(?) coal, but the assemblage is small and fewer specimens were recovered from the coal samples. The seat-rock sample (433-C) is almost barren. The following genera are most abundant in the Gilbert(?) coal (433-A-B):

Densosporites Laevigatosporites Lycospora

10.0 percent 4.8 65.6
86.4 percent

Accessory taxa include Procoronaspora sp., Stenozonotriletes bracteolus (Butterworth and Williams) Smith and Butterworth, and Schulzospora rara Kosanke. The presence of Schulzospora rara is considered significant because this taxon is consistently present in Upper Mississippian and Lower Permsylvanian coals although not abundant in the upper part of its range zone. In eastern Kentucky this taxon is present to near the Corbin Sandstone Member of the Lee Formation; in Europe it is reported present to the Westphalian A-B boundary

by Smith and Butterworth (1967), and by Clayton and others (1977). Gillespie and Pfefferkorn (1979), based on their studies of plant megafossils, placed the Westphalian A-B boundary just above the Sewell coal bed in the New River Formation, somewhat below the Gilbert coal. Procoronaspora sp. and Stenozonotriletes bracteolus are not abundant, and only a few specimens have been identified. The top of their stratigraphic range in Europe is reported by Smith and Butterworth (1967) to be in the upper half of the Namurian; definite information about its range in the United States is lack-

ing. Additional samples from this part of the proposed Pennsylvanian System stratotype should be investigated in order to provide a better understanding of these taxa.
The Cedar Grove coal from the type locality in the Cedar Grove quadrangle is not a part of the proposed Pennsylvanian System stratotype. The Cedar Grove coal occurs about in the middle of the Kanawha Formation (fig. 3, samples of macerations 122-A-D). Three coal samples were collected (table 4). Densosporites is the dominant taxon in the coal samples (122-A-C) as

shown in the summary of most abundant taxa:

Densosporites Granulatisporites Laevigatosporites Lycospora

40.5 percent 6.0
25.3 20.2
92.0 percent

Laevigatosporites is second in abundance to Densosporites with 25.3 percent of the assemblage. This is significantly higher than the 5 percent recorded for Laevigatosporites in the Gilbert(?) coal below. The presence of L. ovalis accounts for much of the increase in abundance of the genus. Although Densosporites is the dominant taxon, especially in 122-B, many of the specimens are poorly preserved and identification to the species level is impossible. Poor preservation is also noted for Lycospora, which accounts for 20.2 percent of the assemblage. Accessory taxa of the Gilbert(?) coal, Procoronaspora, Stenozonotriletes, and Schulzospora are not present in these samples of the Cedar Grove coal from the type locality. Acanthotriletes cf. A. echinatus (Knox) Potonie and Kremp, Punctatisporites obesus (Loose) Potonie and Kremp, and P. sinuatus (Artiiz) Neves are present in limited numbers.

The Winifrede coal, in the upper half of the Kanawha Formation (fig. 3), was collected from the type locality in the Belle quadrangle and assigned to maceration 121 (table 5). This locality is considered to be outside the geographic area of the stratotype. Laevigatosporites is clearly the dominant taxon for the first time stratigraphically, with one-half the assemblage assigned to this genus in coal samples 121-A-B and D-E as follows:

Densosporites Granulatisporites Laevigatosporites Lycospora

9.0 percent 12.3 51.6 11.7
84.6 percent

Laevigatosporites globosus Schemel is an important member of the assemblage inasmuch as it represents 24.2 percent of the population of the coal samples. In the clay parting (No. 121-C), L. globosus Schemel represents 65.6 percent of the assemblage. This taxon is an important member of many younger Pennsylvanian coal assemblages in the United States. Seven species of Laevigatosporites are present in this set of samples of

the Winifrede coal (table 5). The primary differences between the Winifrede and Cedar Grove coals, from their respective type localities, are the presence of L. globosus Schemel and the dominance of Laevigatosporites in the Winifrede coal (see tables 4 and 5).
The Stockton coal, in the upper part of the Kanawha

Formation (fig. 3), contains a parting similar to the Winifrede coal; this is shown in tables 5 and 6. Samples of the Stockton coal were collected from the Valley Camp Coal Company mine located north of Mammoth, W. Va., and assigned to macerations 566-A-G. Two important genera, Radiizonates and Torispora, are present

in this coal that help differentiate the Stockton from the Winifrede coal below. Laevigatosporites and Lycospora are the most abundant taxa in the coal samples (566-A-C and E-F):

Densosporites Laevigatosporites Lycospora Radiizonates

11.4 percent 30.2 30.7 12.5
84.8 percent

The presence of Radiizonates in the coal samples at the rate of 12.5 percent is of interest because it was not observed in the Winifrede coal below. Radiizonates tenuis (Loose) Butterworth and Smith in Butterworth and others (1964) and R. cf. R. faunus (Ibrahim) Smith and Butterworth contribute significantly to this percentage as well as specimens assigned to R. sp. Radiizonates is also present in many of the block coals of the Charleston Sandstone as shown in tables 7-18. Kosanke (1973) reported Radiizonates present in the Richardson-Skyline coals from their respective type localities in eastern Kentucky. Torispora is present only in the top coal sample (566-A), but not in sufficient abundance to occur in the abundance counts.
Trihyphaecites triangularis Peppers was originally described from the Carbondale Formation of Illinois and has been identified from the Stockton coal (566-C). This is an unusual taxon because it is considered to be of fungal origin and produces septate hyphae at each of its three corners. I have also identified this taxon from several coals in eastern Kentucky including the Whitesburg, Fire clay rider, and Francis, all from the Breathitt Formation.

CHARLESTON SANDSTONE
The terminology employed by Englund and others (1979) for stratigraphic units previously included in the Allegheny Formation is used in this report. Additional modifications suggested by T. W. Henry (written commun., 1980) and by H. H. Arndt (oral commun., 1981) have helped to interpret the palynomorph data and to better utilize the stratigraphic and palynomorph data in an effort to understand the geologic history of the Charleston Sandstone.
The samples from the Charleston Sandstone are from exposures, mines, and diamond drill holes in the vicinity of Charleston, Kanawha County, W. Va. The coals examined are the Stockton A, Little No. 5 Block, Lower No. 5 Block, Upper No. 5 Block, and the No. 6 Block coal.

Arndt (1979) summarized the geology of the Charleston Sandstone. From this summary and from field work it is clear that the coals of the Charleston Sandstone were deposited without marine deposition having occurred between the coals; terrestrial deposition followed by marine deposition did not occur in the area of the stratotype. The possible influence of this type of deposition on the palynomorph assemblages is potentially great. >
The Stockton A coal (maceration series 571) occurs a short distance above the Kanawha black flint. Palynomorphs are abundant and well preserved in the Stockton A coal, especially in sample 571-A. In this sample Lycospora is most abundant, and Laevigatosporites and Endosporites are well represented. Also, Florinites, Raistrickia, Verrucosisporites, Cyclogranisporites, Crassispora, Densosporites, Cirratriradites, Acanthotriletes, Wilsonites, and Spackmanites have been identified in this sample. Spackmanites has not been identified from older coals in this study. Torispora securis Balme, which is present in one sample of the Stockton coal (566-A) of the Kanawha Formation, has not been identified in the samples of the Stockton A coal.
The Little No. 5 Block coal (macerations 552-A-G and 434-A-H) was examined for palynomorphs. Samples for macerations 552-A-G were collected from a highwall of the Harewood strip mine located east of Carbondale, Fayette County, W. Va. The taxa identified and their abundance are shown in table 7. The dominant and accessory genera are shown on figure 4. The coal samples yielded abundant and well-preserved palynomorphs, but neither the roof nor seat samples yielded sufficient palynomorphs to make abundance counts worthwhile. The most abundant genera in the Little No. 5 Block coal (552-B-F) are as follows:

Densosporites Lae v igatosporites Lycospora Torispora Radiizonates

10.5 percent 35.5 7.1 14.1
76.7 percent

Laevigatosporites is the most abundant genus, and eight species have been identified (table 7). Laevigatosporites is, in a large measure, uniformly abundant in all the coal samples. Densosporites, especially D. triangularis Kosanke, is numerically important in two coal samples (552-C-D). Torispora securis Balme is the most abundant in the three coal samples (552-B-D), whereas Radiizonates tenuis (Loose) Butterworth and Smith in Butterworth and others is abundant only in

16 PALYNOLOGY OF COAL BEDS IN THE PROPOSED PENNSYLVANIAN STRATOTYPE, WEST VIRGINIA

one coal sample (552-E). Lycospora is numerically important only in the bottom coal sample (552-F). Preservation of specimens assignable to Lycospora is poor and a number of these specimens could not be identified to the species level, especially in the bottom coal sample (552-F). What I have classified as L. pellucida-L. pseudonnulata in table 7 is most abundant.
The second set of samples taken from the Little No. 5 Block coal (maceration 434-A-H) were collected from the Semet-Solvay mine at Harewood northeast of Boomer, Montgomery quadrangle, Fayette County, W. Va. Analyses of these samples are shown in table 8 and on figure 4, and they are very similar to the other set of Little No. 5 Block coal samples (552-A-G) except for the leader coal sample (434-H). The same species of Laevigatosporites are present in the leader coal in approximately the same abundance, but Lycospora represents nearly 50 percent of the assemblage.
Lycospora is present at the rate of only 11.5 percent in

the main part of the coal (434-A-E) as shown:

Densosporites Laevigatosporites Lycospora Radiizonates Torispora

3.9 percent 36.1 11.5 15.3 21.0
87.8 percent

Radiizonates and Torispora are greatly reduced in the leader coal (434-H), as shown in table 8. Stratigraphic and palynological evidence suggests an equivalence between these two samples of the Little No. 5 Block coal (maceration series 552 and 434).
Spencerisporites gracilis (Zerndt) Winslow has not been found below the Little No. 5 coal (434-B). This is of interest because Winslow (1959) reported that the oldest occurrence of this taxon in Illinois was the upper part of the Tradewater Group, a term no longer used in

Illinois. Its rocks are now called the Spoon Formation. The presence of Â£ gracilis in the Little No. 5 coal may indicate approximate equivalence with the Illinois occurrence.
Torispora securis Balme is a prominent taxon of the assemblages of the Little No. 5 Block and the Lower No. 5 Block coals of West Virginia. Torispora was proposed by Balme (1952) for spores that were basically elliptical in proximo-distal orientation, and distinctly monolete, with a pronounced thickening at one extremity of the spore that may be expanded into a crescentic or rectangular projection. The outer layer of some sporangia contains specimens of Torispora securis Balme, which Horst (1957) considered were sporangial cells. For these Horst proposed the binomial Bicoloria gothanii Horst. Because Horst considered these to be sporangial in origin he did not recognize the presence of any proximal apertures. Subsequently, Doubinger and Horst (1941) emended the genus Torispora and

recognized the presence of various types of proximal apertures. Guennel and Neavel (1961) summarized the development of Torispora and recognized Bicoloria for intact sporangia and Torispora for isolated dispersed spores. I have observed these peculiar thickenings on specimens I would identify with a number of monolete taxa, and in one instance on a trilete palynomorph. It is not relevant to this paper to be concerned with the proper classification of Torispora securis except to recognize that the range zone does not necessarily represent the range zone of an individual taxon, but rather a collection of taxa that possess thickenings. I prefer to regard Torispora as representing a monolete taxon with a thickened condition that occurred on certain palynomorphs for a period of geologic time. Torispora is present in coals of the proposed Pennsylvanian System stratotype from near the top of the Kanawha Formation through the Charleston Sandstone. It should be noted that the abundance of Torispora varies greatly, ranging

from zero to 31 percent in adjacent levels of the same coal (434-D-E).
The Lower No. 5 Block coal (macerations 553-A-E) occurs approximately 18 m above the Little No. 5 Block coal (macerations 552-A-G) in the highwall of the Harewood strip mine, east of Carbondale, Fayette County, W. Va. The coal at this locality is 91.2 cm thick. Three equal coal samples were taken in addition to the roof and seat rock samples (table 9). Laevigatosporites is codominant with Torispora; both occur at the rate of 32 percent in the coal samples (553-B-D) as shown:

Densosporites Laevigatosporites Lycospora Radiizonates Torispora

9.6 percent 32.2 3.8 9.2 32.7
87.5 percent

Densosporites and Radiizonates occur at about the same rate as they occur in the Little No. 5 Block maceration series (552). Lycospora decreased in abundance to less than 4 percent, largely because it was almost absent from the upper part of these samples of the Lower No. 5 Block coal. Crassispora kosankei (Potonie and Kremp) Bharadwaj reached 7.6 percent abundance in the bottom coal sample (553-D). Zosterosporites triangularis Kosanke is present in very limited quantities in part of the Lower No. 5 Block coal (macerations 553-A-B).
A second set of the Lower No. 5 Block coal (maceration series 435) was collected from the Semet-Solvay strip mine located east of Smithers, Fayette County, W. Va. The coal at this locality is somewhat thicker than that sampled for the previous set of Lower No. 5 Block coal samples (553-A-E); the palynological analyses are given in table 10.

cessory genera are given on figure 4. These analyses are similar to those of the Lower No. 5 Block coal already discussed (maceration series 553), although minor differences exist. For example, in the coal samples of maceration series 435, Laevigatosporites and Lycospora are more abundant and Torispora is somewhat less abundant than in the coal samples of maceration series 553. Once again, Zosterosporites triangularis Kosanke and Crassispora kosankei (Potonie and Kremp) Bharadwaj are present, the latter species constituting 8 percent (435-B).
Another set of Lower No. 5 Block coal samples (maceration series 446), identified on the basis of stratigraphic position, were collected from the Cannelton Coal Company strip mine near the head of Bullpush Fork, Fayette County, W. Va. The coal is very thick at this locality (238 cm) and contains two partings (table 11). The identified palynomorphs of maceration

series 446 are shown in table 11, and the abundant and accessory genera are shown:

Densosporites Laevigatosporites Lycospora Torispora

6.8 percent 41.7 11.4 26.5
86.4 percent

The preservation of palynomorphs is poor in Lower No. 5 Block coal (maceration series 446) compared to other block coals studied in this report. This is shown by the fact that many specimens of Densosporites could not be identified to the species level and are classified either as Densosporites sp. or as D. "rings." The designation "rings" means that only the thickened equatorial structure remains. The number of specimens of Lycospora and Torispora not identified to the species

level is further proof of poor preservation (maceration series 446). The preservation of palynomorphs in the parting sampled is also poor, preventing a worthwhile abundance count.
Basically the same taxa are present in maceration series 446 as are present in the other Lower No. 5 Block coal samples previously discussed. Crassispora kosankei (Potonie and Kremp) Bharadwaj is present at the rate of 8.8 percent in the bottom coal sample (446-K) corresponding to similar abundances in the other samples of the Lower No. 5 Block coal (553-D and 435-B). The most abundant genera occurring in the coal samples of maceration series 446 (table 11) are:

Densosporites Laevigatosporites Lycospora Torispora

22.3 percent 37.7 12.1 9.4
81.3 percent

Zosterosporites triangularis Kosanke, which was present in the first two sets of Lower No. 5 Block coal samples, has not been identified from samples of maceration series 446. On the basis of overall abundance, it is questionable whether or not samples of maceration series 446 correlate with those of the Lower No. 5 Block coal (maceration series 553 and 435). A separate evaluation of the three coal benches of maceration series 446 suggests that the lower bench (446-I-K) is more closely related to the Lower No. 5 Block coal samples (553 and
435). Thick and somewhat variable in occurrence, the coals
of the Charleston Sandstone may represent rapid accumulation and burial as a result of the absence of disruptive marine incursions between coals. The amount of elapsed geologic time might not be as great as one might expect. Similarity of palynological assemblages may very well be a measure of similarity of paleoecologic conditions.

Wanless (1939) correlated the No. 5 Block coal, which is mined extensively in the Kanawha River Valley, with the Lower Kittanning coal of Pennsylvania and Ohio. In the current nomenclature of the block coals, the No. 5 Block coal of Wanless is probably the Lower No. 5 Block coal. The Lower No. 5 Block coal does not correlate with the Lower Kittanning coal, but is older, and this will be taken up subsequently with the discussion of the Upper No. 6 Block coal.
The Upper No. 5 Block coal occurs in benches, coal separated from coal by non-coal layers, and the correlation of these separate benches may be difficult. The correlation of these coal benches is based on palynological evidence such as abundance, or guide fossils, or a combination of these factors. For example, the thin coal (maceration 554-A) does not contain Thymospora pseudothiessenii (Kosanke) Wilson and Venkatachala and as a result is not correlative with samples of maceration series 573, but is older.

Upper No. 5 Block(?) coal (maceration series 447, table 12) was collected from the Union Carbide 7C mine located near Sanderson, Kanawha County, W. Va. A parting 12.7 cm thick separates the bottom 40.6 cm of coal from the top 100.8 cm of coal. The overall abundance is similar to that of the Lower No. 5 Block(?) coal (maceration series 446, table 11). However, Crassispora kosankei (Potonie and Kremp) Bharadwaj does not exceed the 2 percent level in any of the segment samples, and Zosterosporites triangularis Kosanke is present in the parting sample (447-D).
Preservation of palynomorphs extracted from coal samples of maceration series 447 is better than that of coal samples of maceration series 446. The non-coal samples of maceration series 447 did not yield sufficient or well-preserved palynomorphs to make abundance counts. The majority of the specimens that were identified from this parting are thought to be herbaceous. The same is true of the parting samples of the 446

Coal sample 554-B, occurring about 5 m above 554-D, has Lycospora as the dominant genus and Laevigatosporites as the subdominant. The bone coal sample 554-A, occurring about 2.5 m above 554-B, has Densosporites and Laevigatosporites as codominant genera. The codominance of these two genera together with specimens assigned to Verrucosisporites differentiates this sample (554-A) from the other two coal samples of this series (554-B and 554-D).
A set of samples of the Upper No. 5 Block coal (maceration series 572-A-F) was collected from above
the 12-A of the Valley Camp Coal Company northwest of Mammoth, Kanawha County, W. Va. The palynological data are shown in table 14, and the abundant genera of the coal samples (572-B-E) are:

Densosporites Laevigatosporites Lycospora Torispora

4.3 percent 43.3 16.0 21.4
85.0 percent

Laevigatosporites is clearly dominant; Lycospora, Torispora, and Densosporites are present at approximately the same rate as in another sample of the Upper No. 5 Block coal (554-D).
Another coal sample that is thought from palynological evidence to be related to the Upper No. 5 Block coal (maceration series 436) was collected about 20 m above the Lower No. 5 Block coal (maceration series 435). The palynomorph analyses are shown in

table 15, and the bottom two samples (436-B-C) were productive. Analyses of these samples suggest a similarity to other samples of the Upper No. 5 Block coal (554-D and maceration series 572). Radiizonates is present although not abundant in all sets of the Upper No. 5 Block coal (maceration series 436, 554, and 572). Zosterosporites triangularis is present in the seat-rock sample of the 436 maceration series. The numerically important genera of coal sample 436-B are:

Laevigatosporites Lycospora Torispora

53.2 percent 15.2 13.2
81.6 percent

Another set of samples of the Upper No. 5 Block coal (574-A-C) were collected adjacent to a pipeline northwest of Marting, east of the Kanawha-Fayette County line, in Fayette County, W. Va. The sample breakdown and palynomorph analyses are given in table 16. These

samples appear to be related to those of maceration 554-B because each coal sample has Lycospora as the dominant taxon. However, Triquitrites and Granulatisporites are notably more abundant in coal sample 574-A.
Zosterosporites triangularis Kosanke has been identified from both the Lower and Upper No. 5 Block coals, but it is not abundant and does not occur consistently. This type of range zone was observed in some coals of the Princess Reserve District of eastern Kentucky by Kosanke (1973). The abundant genera of coal sample

The exact palynological placement of maceration 554-A is not certain, but it most likely would fall between maceration series 574 and 573 of the Upper No. 5 Block coal. Four samples (573-A-D) were collected from the highwall of the Cannelton Coal Company Mine, located northwest of Marting and east of the Kanawha-Fayette County line in Fayette County, W. Va., but only the coal sample 573-B-C contained sufficient palynomorphs to make abundance counts (table 17).
Most significant is the occurrence of Thymospora at the rate of 11.4 percent together with the presence of Punctatisporites obliquus Kosanke and P. minutus (Kosanke) Peppers, because this must place the samples of maceration series 573 very close to the position of the Lower Kittanning coal. In Illinois, the range zone of T. pseudothiessenii starts below the Colchester (No. 2) Coal Member according to Kosanke (1950) and Peppers (1970) and is present throughout the Carbondale Formation and the lower part of the Modesto Formation.

Kosanke (1973) reported that the range zone of T. pseudothiessenii, in the Princess Reserve District of northeastern Kentucky, started in the Princess 5B coal, which is stratigraphically just below the Princess No. 6 coal and is present above in the Breathitt and Conemaugh Formations. Kosanke (1973) correlated the Princess No. 6 coal with the Lower Kittanning coal of western Pennsylvania and eastern Ohio. Gray (1967) reported on the palynomorph content of coals in the lower and middle Allegheny of western Pennsylvania and eastern Ohio. Thymospora pseudothiessenii was identified from the Lower Kittanning and younger coals but not from the Lawrence coal, a thin coal occurring below the Lower Kittanning coal.
The presence of Thymospora in coal samples of maceration series 573 suggests that the coal is near the position of the Lower Kittanning coal. A comparison of the assemblage of palynomorphs from the Lower Kittanning coal (Habib, 1966; Gray, 1967) with those of series 573, however, suggests that series 573 is older,

based on the presence of Schopfites in the Lower Kittanning coal and its absence from series 573. Further, the coal of maceration series 573 would be older than the Princess No. 6 coal of northeastern Kentucky (Kosanke, 1973) for the same reason, the lack of Schopfites. A summary of generic abundance for coal samples 573-B-C follows:

Acan thotrile tes Laevigatosporites Lycospora Punctatisporites Thymospora

11.4 percent 47.4 12.0
5.0 11.4
87.2 percent

No. 6 Block coal occurs about 15 m above the Upper No. 5 Block coal (573) in the highwall of the Cannelton Coal Company strip. The only good sample collected from the No. 6 Block coal (maceration 603) was a block of coal about 15 cm thick. This sample yielded an interesting assemblage of palynomorphs (table 18). Thymospora pseudothiessenii (Kosanke) Wilson and Venkatachala is present, constituting 21 percent of the assemblage. I have found Schopfites thus far only in the No. 6 Block coal bed of the proposed Pennsylvanian System stratotype of West Virginia. Such an occurrence places the No. 6 Block coal (maceration 603) at the position of the Princess No. 6 and No. 7 coals of eastern Kentucky (Kosanke, 1973, p. 4). Habib (1966) reported Schopfites sp. present in the Lower Kittanning coal of western Pennsylvania. Gray (1967) reported this genus present in the Lower and Middle Kittanning coals of western Pennsylvania and eastern Ohio. Kosanke originally described the genus from the Colchester (No. 2) Coal Member of the Carbondale Formation of Illinois and reported the genus to be present from there up to and including the Briar Hill (No. 5A) coal. Peppers (1970) reported Schopfites present in two thin coals below the Colchester (No. 2) Coal Member of the Carbondale and that it occurred above the Colchester up to and including the Briar Hill (No. 5A) Coal Member of the Carbondale. Interestingly, Gray (1967) reported Schopfites present in the Strasburg coal of Ohio, which occurs between the Lower and Middle Kittanning coals.
Normally Thymospora pseudothiessenii (Kosanke) Wilson and Venkatachala would not be present in the Lower Kittanning coal at the rate of 21 percent of the assemblage as it is in the No. 6 Block coal (maceration 603). The high percentage of T. pseudothiessenii is unexplained, but may be related to the fact that the sample (603) was merely a part of a coal bed (one block). Gray

(1967) reported T. pseudothiessenii present in the Lower Kittanning coal at the rate of 2.9 percent based on overall occurrence in the coal, but it reached a maximum of 21 percent in the top half of the Lower Kittanning coal. Habib (1966) reported that T. pseudothiessenii occurred in his samples of the Lower Kittanning coal and varied in abundance from 2 to 19 percent. Peppers (1970) reported T. pseudothiessenii present in Illinois at the rate of less than 10 percent until the Summum (No. 4) Coal Member is reached, at which time it is abundant (from 12 to more than 25 percent) through the Briar Hill
(No. 5A) Coal Member. Because the No. 6 Block coal sample represents only
one block rather than a column sample of the coal, it is possible to indicate only that this sample could correlate with the Lower Kittanning coal of western Pennsylvania and eastern Ohio and the Princess No. 6 coal of eastern Kentucky. Kosanke (1973) reported the overall average of Thymospora pseudothiessenii in the Princess No. 6 coal to be about 6 percent, but as high as 30 per-
cent in the Princess No. 7 coal above. A summary of most abundant genera of coal sample
603 follows:

UPPER PENNSYLVANIAN SERIES
CONEMAUGH AND MONONGAHELA FORMATIONS

The Conemaugh Formation in its type area in the northern part of the Dunkard Basin is bracketed below by the Upper Freeport coal and above by the Pittsburgh coal. Because coals are not prominent in this part of the Pennsylvanian System stratotype, the base of the Conemaugh Formation, according to T. W. Henry (oral commun., 1980), is the first appearance of the red bed sequence above what Krebs (1914) called the "Mahoning sandstone." The top of the Conemaugh Formation is the base of the Pittsburgh No. 8 coal. Samples from the Conemaugh Formation have been collected and are being studied.
The primary coal of the Monongahela Formation, the Pittsburgh No. 8 coal, is the base of the formation (fig. 3). A sample of coal from a locality 1.6 km south of

Tuppers Creek Road along Interstate 77 in the Pocatalico quadrangle was correlated with the Pittsburgh No. 8 coal. These samples were assigned to macerations 428-A-C, and the numerically important taxa appear in table 19 and on figure 4. The characteristic or diagnostic occurrence of Thymospora thiessenii (Kosanke) Wilson and Venkatachala as the dominant palynomorph in all levels of the Pittsburgh No. 8 coal was initially reported by Thiessen and Staud (1923), based on their coal thin-section investigations,

and subsequently by Kosanke (1943) based on coal maceration studies. Theissen originally referred to this spore as the "Pittsburgh" spore and later as the "Pittsburgh microspore." Kosanke (1943) described this same taxon and named it Laevigatosporites thiessenii. Subsequently, Wilson and Venkatachala (1963) transferred it to Thymospora thiessenii. The most unusual aspect of the Pittsburgh No. 8 coal is that T. thiessenii represents more than three-fourths of the total palynomorph assemblage.

PALYNOMORPH ASSEMBLAGES FROM PART OF THE POTTSVILLE FORMATION OF OHIO AND THE LEE FORMATION OF
EASTERN KENTUCKY
The Pennsylvania!! rocks of Ohio and eastern Kentucky are not highly metamorphosed; therefore, recovery of palynomorphs is relatively easy and preservation is generally excellent. Figure 7, modified from Stout (1939), records the presence of four coals within the basal 30.4 m of the Pottsville Formation of Ohio. The oldest coal is the Sharon No. 1 coal, which occurs a short distance above the Sharon Conglomerate Member (Stout, 1939; Collins, 1979). Above this, in this 30.4 m interval, Stout recorded the presence of the Anthony, Huckleberry, and Quakertown No. 2 coals. The Sharon No. 1 and the Quakertown No. 2 coals were mined and prized for their low sulfur content. For a discussion of the lithostratigraphy, biostratigraphy, and coal resources of this part of the Pottsville of Ohio, see Collins (1979).
Two sets of samples of the Sharon No. 1 coal have been collected, prepared, and examined. These sets of samples (maceration series 469 and 542) are from Byer quadrangle, Jackson County, in southern Ohio. The coal of maceration series 469 is 83.7 cm thick. The palynological data are shown in table 20, and the abundant genera are:

mined. The sample prepared and examined was 27.9 cm thick and came from the Sciotoville quadrangle in southern Ohio. Lycospora is the dominant taxon (table 21), and Densosporites is subdominant. Lycospora pellucida (Wicher) Schopf, Wilson, and Bentall-L. pseudoannulata Kosanke represents 33.6 percent of the palynomorph assemblage. This assemblage is similar to the sample from the Sharon No. 1 coal in that Densosporites covensis Berry and D. irregularis

Lycospora and Densosporites are codominant taxa and represent 85 percent of the assemblage. Both of these genera are related to the Lycopsida. Chaloner (1958) reported that the spores of Lycospora have been associated with arborescent lycopods, whereas the spores of Densosporites are associated with herbaceous lycopods. Six species of Densosporites have been identified (table 20) and Lycospora pellucida (Wicher) Schopf, Wilson, and Bentall-L. pseudoannulata Kosanke is the dominant taxon assigned to that genus. No specimens assignable to Laevigatosporites were observed. The second sample, maceration 542, is only 52.7 cm thick and was collected as a single unit. A somewhat smaller assemblage of similar taxa was observed in sample 542, except that Densosporites is the dominant taxon and Lycospora is subdominant. Densosporites covensis Berry and D. irregularis Hacquebard and Barss are present, and these taxa occur elsewhere in the United States in Lower Pennsylvanian coals.

others were observed as shown in table 21. No specimens assignable to Laevigatosporites were observed.
The Huckleberry coal is thin and occurs above the Anthony coal and below the Quakertown No. 1 coal. No samples of this coal were available for study, so it is not known whether or not Laevigatosporites first occurs in the Huckleberry or in the Quakertown No. 2 coal. The occurrence of Laevigatosporites is well established in the Quakertown No. 2 coal (table 22; fig. 4); this is the start of the consistent occurrence of Laevigatosporites range zone in Pennsylvanian coals of Ohio. Poorly preserved single specimens of what were questionably assigned to Laevigatosporites were observed in both sets of the Sewell and Sharon No. 1 coal. Both sets of samples of the Quakertown No. 2 coal are from the Byer

L. pellucida (Wicher) Schopf, Wilson, and Bentall-L. pseudoannulata Kosanke is the most abundant taxon (table 22). In addition, L. granulata Kosanke is numerically important in the top half of the coal (468-B). The following species of Laevigatosporites have been identified: L. desmoinensis (Wilson and Coe) Schopf, Wilson, and Bentall, L. latus Kosanke, L. medius Kosanke, and L. ovalis Kosanke. Densosporites is poorly represented in the Quakertown No. 2 coal, which contrasts markedly with the abundance of this taxon found in both the Sharon No. 1 and Anthony coals.
Maceration series 541, the Quakertown No. 2 coal, is 65 cm thick and was sampled as the top half of the coal (541-A) and the bottom half of the coal (541-B). Lycospora is the dominant genus in both samples with L. granulata Kosanke the most abundant species followed by L. pellucida (Wicher) Schopf, Wilson, and Bentall-L. pseudoannulata Kosanke. Laevigatosporites is present at about the same rate as was found in maceration series 468 (9.4 versus 9.7 percent), and an additional species, L. vulgaris (Ibrahim) Alpern and Doubinger, is present. The bottom sample (541-B) contains specimens which I assigned to Endosporites cf. E. zonalis (Loose) Knox. Endosporites is present in maceration series 468, but not this species.
The palynomorph content of three coals occurring within the basal 30 m of the Pottsville Formation of Ohio has been examined in detail. Representatives of both arborescent (Lycospora} and herbaceous (Densosporites ) lycopods dominate the assemblages of these coals. The start of the consistent occurrence of Laevigatosporites is found in the Quakertown No. 2 coal. No palynological information is available on the Huckleberry coal; the start of the range zone of Laevigatosporites in Ohio should be clarified.
The basal Pennsylvania!! formation in eastern Kentucky is the Lee Formation. The lower portion of this formation is well exposed along the London boat dock in the Sawyer quadrangle, Laurel County, Ky. Six sets of samples were collected along the road leading to the London boat dock (maceration series 129-134). Kilburn (1956) gave the measured thickness as 100.2 m. The section begins near BM B-202 at the dock at the Pennington-Lee contact and continues along the road to the top of the plateau in the Sawyer quadrangle. (For additional information see Puffett, 1962, and Rice and

others, 1979.) Abundant and well-preserved spores and pollen grains were common to the upper five sets of coal samples (maceration series 129-133). The basal coal sample (maceration 134) contains a number of palynomorphs, but the sample is weathered and preservation of palynomorphs is poor so that abundance counts are not reliable. Lycospora is the most abundant taxon found in the other five sets of coal samples from the Hudson through the Barren Fork coal near the top of the section (fig. 8). The Barren Fork coal is the most diversified of the coals with respect to palynomorph content. Schulzospora rara Kosanke occurs in all six sets of the London boat dock section. Densosporites irregularis Hacquebard and Barss ranges from the Mississippian rocks below through the Beaver Creek coal in the Lee Formation (fig. 8). Stenozonotriletes lycosporoides (Butterworth and Williams) Smith and Butterworth occurs in the unnamed coal, the Hudson coal, and the Stearns IVz coal, but Trinidulus diamphidious Felix and Padden is present only in the Stearns IVz coal. Punctatisporites sinuatus (Artiiz) Neves apparently first appears in the Hudson coal, Dictyotriletes bireticulatus (Ibrahim) Smith and Butterworth first appears in the thin unnamed coal (maceration series 130) just above the Hudson coal, and Laevigatosporites is known to occur first in the Barren Fork coal.
The Schulzospora range zone is continuous through all of the coals exposed in the London boat dock section of Kentucky and is known to terminate in the lower part of the Middle Pennsylvania!!. In Ohio Schulzospora is known to be present in the Sharon No. 1, Anthony, and Quakertown No. 2 coals. The start of the Laevigatosporites range zone in eastern Kentucky is at the Barren Fork coal, and we know this genus is present in the Quakertown No. 2 coal of Ohio.
SUMMARY
Coals occurring in the upper half of the New River through the Monongahela Formations of the proposed Pennsylvanian System stratotype of West Virginia are amenable to the chemical maceration process allowing palynomorphs to be extracted. However, although coals occurring in the lower half of the New River and Pocahontas Formations react to the chemical maceration process, they do not consistently yield palynomorphs, so meaningful analyses are not possible. For this and other reasons, some Lower Pennsylvanian coals from Ohio have been incorporated into this report together with remarks on the occurrence of palynomorphs from some Lower Pennsylvanian coals from eastern Kentucky. Figures 4 and 9 summarize the abundance and occurrence of taxa useful in correlation

studies. It should be noted that the scope of this investigation is the occurrence of palynomorphs of selected coal beds. Therefore, because every coal has not yet been examined, gaps remain in our knowledge concerning the precise range zones of some taxa.
The following are some of the taxa that have restricted or otherwise useful range zones (fig. 9), and are useful in biostratigraphic studies:
Densosporites annulatus (Loose) Schopf, Wilson, and Bentall
D. irregularis Hacquebard and Barss Laevigatosporites ghbosus Schemel L. punctatus Kosanke Radiizonates spp. Savitrisporites nux (Butterworth and Williams)
Smith and Butterworth Schopfites dimorphus Kosanke Schulzospora rara Kosanke

Thymospora pseudothiessenii T. thiessenii (Kosanke) Wilson and Venkatachala Torispora securis Balme
Lower Pennsylvanian coals from Ohio are dominated by lycopsid plants as evidenced by the abundance of Lycospora and Densosporites (fig. 4). The same is true for the Lee coals of eastern Kentucky. The Lower Douglas(?), Gilbert(?) and Cedar Grove coals from the lower part of the Kanawha Formation of West Virginia are dominated by lycopsid palynomorphs. Above the Cedar Grove coal in the Kanawha Formation of West Virginia, a significant change is noted in palynomorph assemblages by the dominance of Laevigatosporites in the Winifrede coal (maceration series 121). Changes were occurring rapidly by the time the Stockton coal (maceration series 566) was deposited somewhat below the Kanawha black flint, although some of these changes may have their roots in the Coalberg coal

42 PALYNOLOGY OF COAL BEDS IN THE PROPOSED PENNSYLVANIAN STRATOTYPE, WEST VIRGINIA

below. Studies of the Coalberg coal have not been completed. Some of the changes noted in the Stockton coal are the following first occurrences:
Laevigatosporites punctatus Kosanke Microreticulatisporites sulcatus (Wilson and
Kosanke) Smith and Butterworth Radiizonates spp. Torispora securis Balme Verrucosisporites sifati (Ibrahim) Smith and
Butterworth Vestispora fenestrata (Kosanke and Brokaw) Spode
in Smith and Butterworth
The Stockton A coal maceration series 571, occurring just above the Kanawha black flint in the Charleston Sandstone, lacks Radiizonates and Torispora, and Lycospora is the dominant taxon. The Little No. 5 Block coal occurs above the Stockton A coal in the Charleston Sandstone. Two sets of maceration samples have been examined (maceration series 552 and 434). The Little No. 5 Block coal is characterized by a dominance of Laevigatosporites, with Torispora and Radiizonates being well represented. The fact that Torispora is so well represented (14-20 percent) may be related to some environmental or other factor that controls the development of the unusual wall thickenings found on this taxon. The Lower No. 5 Block coal (maceration series 553 and 435) occurs above the Little No. 5 Block coal in the Charleston Sandstone. In these Lower No. 5 Block coal samples, Laevigatosporites and Torispora represent 65-70 percent of the assemblage of palynomorphs. The presence of Crassispora at the rate of 7-8 percent in one segment sample of each of the three sets of the Lower No. 5 Block coal examined (553-D, 435-B, and 446-K) is worthy of note.
Samples of maceration series 446 were thought, on the basis of stratigraphic position, to be the Lower No. 5 Block coal and should correlate with samples of maceration series 435 and 553. Laevigatosporites is the most abundant taxon in all three sets of samples, and as previously mentioned, Crassispora has a similar occurrence pattern in these samples. However, maceration series 446 differs from maceration series 435 and 553 in that Densosporites is subdominant and Torispora is significantly reduced in abundance. Another set of samples (maceration series 447) that has been considered to be at the Upper No. 5 Block level is palynologically similar to those of maceration series 446, with some minor differences.
The Upper No. 5 Block coal is benched, and a series of samples have been collected. These samples are arranged by stratigraphic position and by palynological content on figure 3. Samples from 436-A-C, 554-D, and

572-A-F are palynologically related by a dominance of Laevigatosporites and an occurrence of other taxa. Samples from 554-B and from 574-A-C are related by a dominance of Lycospora, even though minor differences occur. The presence of Zosterosporites in 574-B represents the youngest occurrence of this taxon thus far recorded from the stratotype sections. From palynological evidence, I place the bone coal sample (554-A) next in ascending order because it contains Radiizonates, which is lacking in maceration series 573. Samples of maceration series 573 are considered to be the upper bench of the Upper No. 5 Block coal and contain Thymospora and other taxa placing this coal close to the position of the Lower Kittanning coal of western Pennsylvania and eastern Ohio and the Princess No. 6 coal of eastern Kentucky. The presence of Thymospora is considered to be an important change in the palynomorph assemblage.
The No. 6 Block coal (maceration series 603) may be distinguished from all other coals in the Charleston Sandstone thus far discussed by the abundance of Thymospora and the presence of Schopfites. This coal is on a level with the Lower Kittanning of western Pennsylvania and eastern Ohio and the Princess No. 6 coal of eastern Kentucky.
The Pittsburgh No. 8 coal bed is characterized by a dominance of Thymospora thiessenii (Kosanke) Wilson and Venkatachala, according to Kosanke (1943). No other coal is known to have such a dominance of this taxon, so it is believed that the coal samples of maceration series 428 from the stratotype section correlate with the Pittsburgh No. 8 coal.
Palynomorph assemblages have been determined for selected coal beds and adjacent seat- and roof-rock samples from the proposed Pennsylvanian System stratotype of West Virginia with some additional samples from the States of Ohio and Kentucky. The floristic changes occurring in coal swamp vegetation throughout Pennsylvanian time and plant succession within individual coal beds are recorded by this investigation. Correlation of coal beds within and outside the proposed Pennsylvanian System stratotype can be accomplished with productive palynomorph samples. The range zones thus far established for the various palynomorph taxa provide a framework for subsequent biostratigraphic investigations.
