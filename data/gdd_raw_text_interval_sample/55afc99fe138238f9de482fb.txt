Gangue minerals:
Geologic description: MacKevett and Holloway (1977, locality 9) describe mined areas extending three to six miles downstream from the landing strip located near the head of the Lewis River on the west side of Mt. Susitna. Stream gravel carry coarse angular gold with attached quartz. Cobb (1979, OFR 80-86, p. 17-18) reports that gold is probably derived from quartz veins in local Jurassic or Cretaceous granitic bedrock or from reworked Tertiary conglomerate. Drilling for possible dredging was done in the early 1900's. Placer mining was active mostly before 1918. Bedrock is 12 to 22 feet below surface. According to Brooks (1918, p. 45-47), seven small placer operations operated in 1916 in the canyon between upper basin and the flats and produced over $2,000 in gold (worth $18.66 an ounce). One $2 nugget was found. An unknown but probably small amount of gold recovered in 195657 (Cobb, 1973, B 1374, p. 17).

Location description and accuracy: Fernette and Cleveland (1984) locate the Miss Molly prospect on the north side of the Trimble River near the toe of the Trimble Glacier in Section 18, T. 19 N., R. 15 W. The area is mostly covered by glacial debris and dense vegetation, with good bedrock exposures along the Trimble River and in stream valleys (U.S. Bureau of Mines, 1998, MAS # 0020840031 and U.S. Bureau of Mines, 1973, localites 26 and 46). Location is known to within 100 yards.

Commodities:

Main: Mo, Pb, Zn

Other: F Ore minerals: Galena, molybdenite, pyrite, sphalerite

Gangue minerals: Fluorite, quartz
Geologic description: Fernette and Cleveland (1984) described the mineralization at Miss Molly as quartz veins with medium to coarse-grained molybdenite, pyrite, and local fluorite. Veins are regularly spaced, sub parallel, vary from 2 to 10 cm wide, and are spaced 2 to 10m apart. Veins occur in two zones about 545 m long and up to 150 m wide in a leucocratic, equigranular biotite granite stock. Veins locally fill joints and less commonly shears. Hydrothermal alteration up to 0.3 m wide to sericite and pyrite, occurs adjacent to veins. Grab and chip samples contain up to 0.38% Mo, 0.16% Zn and 100 ppb Au. The granite stock intrudes Mesozoic marine sediments (KJs) of the Kahlitna terrane (Fernette and Cleveland, 1984 and Nokleberg and others, 1987). Reed and Lanphere (1972) report nearby granitic plutons with K-Ar ages of 56-59 m.y. and is probably the same age as the intrusion hosting the veins.

Alteration: Quartz, sericite, clay, alunite? (Fernette and Cleveland, 1984).

Longitude: 152.74

Location description and accuracy: Alaska Department of Natural Resources unpublished claim records locate these prospects on the west side of the Skwentna River, one to one-and-one half miles south of the confluence of Emerald Creek and the Skewntna River. The site covers an area of about eight square miles in Sections 28, 29, 31,32, and 33, T. 20 N., R. 19 W. Location given is in the northeast corner of the area.

Commodities:

Main: Au, Cu, Mo, Zn

Other: As, Fe

Ore minerals: Arsenopyrite, chalcopyrite, gold, molybdenite, pyrite, pyrrhotite, sphalerite

Gangue minerals: Magnetite, quartz

Geologic description: Reed and Elliott (1970) show this locality to be underlain by Mesozoic sediments (KJs) of the Kahlitna terrane that are intruded by a small body of granite and quartz monzonite (TKig). Detailed mapping in the late 1980's by Cominco American Incorporated identified veins and disseminations of pyrite-chalcopyrite and arsenopyrite-gold and stockwork quartz veins with magnetite and trace amounts of molybdenite cutting fine- to mediumgrained plagioclase-hornblende porphyritic andesite and medium-grained monzonitic plutonic rocks at this site. Carbonate-rich beds in the sedimentary country rocks are locally replaced with pyrrhotite, pyrite, and sphalerite. Numerous occurrences are reported over an 8 square mile area. (Cominco American Incorporated, unpublished reports, 1987and 1988.) Host rocks are most likely Late Cretaceous or Early Tertiary(?) based on nearby K-Ar ages published by Reed and Lanphere (1972). Mineralization is probably related to these intrusions.

Alteration: Propylitic (chlorite-epidote-carbonate +/- magnetite); argillic/sericitic; silicic.

Geologic description: The Mount Estelle pluton, dated at 65 to 66 m.y. by Reed and Lanphere (1972), is the
southern most Late Cretaceous/early Tertiary composite pluton (Tcp) of the Yentna trend. This trend is described by Reed and Nelson (1980) as a 65-km-long curvilinear belt extending from Mount Estelle in the south to Cascade Creek in the northeast. These plutons primarily intrude Mesozoic marine sedimentary rocks (KJs) of the Kahiltna terrane. The Mount Estelle pluton (Tme; Reed and Elliott, 1970) is zoned from a granite core to marginal phases of quartz monzonite, quartz monzodiorite, augite monzodiore, diorite and lamprophyric mafic and ultramafic rocks (Millholland,1995; Crowe and others, 1991; Crowe and Millholland, 1990). Xenoliths of the KJs country rocks and of the various intrusive phases are noted throughout the pluton. Sheeted joint sets and unusual spherical, onion skin-like features occur primarly within the core of the pluton. Tourmaline and beryl are noted in and adjacent to the pluton. Foley and others (1997) note that the composite plutons at the southwestern end of the Yentna trend are more granitic and probably

Page 37

Alaska Resource Data File

TY019

have not been as deeply eroded as the more mafic and ultramafic bodies to the northeast in the Talkeetna quadrangle. Adjacent to the Mount Estelle pluton the KJs is hornfelsed and locally exhibits red staining and sercite-clay-pyrite alteration as disseminations and fracture coatings. The altered sediments do not contain elevated gold values.
Float and stream sediment samples from the Mount Estelle pluton indicate widespread polymetallic mineralization. Stream sediments indicate consistently positive anomalous amounts of gold, copper, arsenic, and silver. Mineralized rock samples, both disseminated and vein type, typically give high values for gold and copper and some contain anomalous amounts of silver, arsenic, molybdenum, bismuth, boron, lead, antimony, tin, zinc and manganese. Cominco American Incorporated's work (unpublished reports, 1985-1989) show gold values ranging from ppm-level to one or more ounces per ton in select samples. Native gold occurs with chalcopyrite, pyrite, arsenopyrite, and pyrrhotite associated with sericite, carbonate and chlorite alteration in sheeted joints, stockwork veinlets, and circular structures that range from 1 inches to more than 15 feet in diameter (Millholland,1995; Crowe and others, 1991; Crowe and Millholland, 1990). These structures are localized in the felsic and intermediate phases of the pluton. Gold associated with pyrrhotite, chalcopyrite, pentlandite and molybdenite also occurs in ultramafic rocks on the south side of the pluton. Mineralization is less common in the sedimentary rocks. In Muddy Creek one zone of coarse galena, pyrrhotite, sphalerite and chalcopyrite replaces carbonate-rich horizons in the hornfelsed sedimentary rocks.
Anomalous gold, platinum-group elements, copper, chrome, nickel and arsenic are reported from many of the composite plutons of the Yentna trend (Reed and others, 1978; Reed and Nelson, 1980; Nelson and others 1992). Gold and platinum group element placers have been worked at sites downstream from these bodies (Mertie, 1919; Cobb, 1973). See also ARDF numbers TL001, TL 002, TL003, TL020, TL023, TL051, TL052, TL053.
There are notable similarities between the Mount Estelle pluton and the Kohlsaat pluton described by Reiners and others (1997). Kohsaat is a concentrically zoned body with a biotite-granite-porphyry core that intruded seriate and porphyritic intermediate composition rocks. The latter include olivine-, pyroxene-, and biotite-bearing quartz syenite, quartz monzonite, and monzonite. Lamprophyric mafic and ultramafic rocks that range in composition from peridotite to alkali gabbro and monzonite are found as large xenoliths at the northeastern margin of the pluton. The granite- porphyry core is altered to sericite, quartz, carbonate and tourmaline assemblages, with minor enrichments of copper, gold, lead, molybdenum, and zinc. They have postulated that the composite pluton at Kohlsaat formed from depleted mantle melts that were contaminated during several stages of mafic magma generation by crustal components. See also ARDF number TL052.

Alteration: Alteration is weak and restricted to vein and joint selvages. Carbonate, chlorite, sericite, and quartz are commonly associated with the sulfide and gold mineralization (Millholland, 1995; Crowe and others, 1991; Crowe and Millholland, 1990; Cominco American Incorporated, unpublished reports, 1985 -1989).

Age of mineralization: Late Cretacous to Early Tertiary based on 65 to 66 m.y. intrusions that are probably re-

Workings/exploration: Prospecting in the area has been conducted by several private companies since the 1970's. From 1980 to 1985 the ground was held for placer potential, however it was never worked because the large glacial boulders in the stream gravels hampered recovery efforts. Work on the property included: silt and rock geochemistry, mapping, magnetic, VLF, IP and radar geophysical surveys, and diamond drilling. To evaluate the steep, glaciated terrain, technical climbers from Dihedral Exploration were employed.

Geologic description: Part of the Yentna trend of Late Cretaceous/early Tertiary composite plutons (Tcp) de-
scribed by Reed and Nelson (1980), the Mount Estelle pluton (Tme, Reed and Elliott, 1970) extends from Timber Creek on the south to the Portage Creek area in the north. At this site in the central part of the pluton, a biotite-hornblende-quartz monzonite intrudes Mesozoic marine sedimentary rocks (KJs) of the Kahiltna terrane.
Two veins follow dilatational zones within the pluton along its west side (Cominco American Incorporated, unpublished reports, 1986-1987). The Main Stoney vein is steeply dipping structure that is mapped as more than 3 miles long, varies in measured width from 14 feet to 60 feet and has a vertical relief of at least 1000 feet. The mineralogy consists of alternating sulfide-quartz -carbonate vein material and altered intrusive material. The mineralogy consists of quartz-calcite-dolomite-siderite-tourmalinepyrrhotite-chalcopyrite- arsenopyrite-pyrite-stibnite +/- graphite, sphalerite and galena. The North Stoney vein is a sub-parallel feature just west of the northern end of the Main Stoney vein. This vein is 35 feet at it's widest and has similar mineralogy to the Main Stoney vein. A third vein is located one mile to the west.

Geologic description: Fine- to medium-grained, equigranular biotite-hornblende diorite intrudes and hornfels Mesozoic marine sedimentary rocks (KJs) of the Kahlitna terrane (Reed and Elliott, 1970). The hornfels is pyritic and locally sheared. Float from inaccessible portions of the diorite have thin (less than 1 inch) veins of quartz-arsenopyrite-pyrite and quartzmolybdenite-sphalerite. Samples of vein material from the diorite contained up to 4400 ppb gold and 1380 ppm silver. A 15 foot chip samples across pyritic, sheared hornfels ran 3800 ppb gold. (Cominco American Incorporated, unpublished reports, 1987-1988). The diorite is probably part of the Late Cretaceous/Early Tertiary Mount Estelle plutonic suite (Tme) (Reed and Elliott, 1970; Reed and Nelson, 1980); veins may be genetically related to the host rocks.

Alteration: Limonite, quartz

Age of mineralization: Host rocks are late Cretaceous or Early Tertiary (?) (by Reed and Elliott, 1970 and Reed and Nelson, 1980); the veins may be genetically related to the host rocks.

Radioactive rock probably formed by deposition of small amounts of uranium that migrated with subsurface water moving along joints. Exploration did not disclose any extension of radioactive rock below surface or away from joints. Maximum amount of radioactivity in USGS samples was 0.021% uranium; prospector reported assay of 0.29% uranium in one sample (Freeman, 1963, p. 29-30).

Geologic description: Folded volcanic rocks are cut by granitic dioritic and syenitic dikes. Rock along contacts between dikes and volcanics are decomposed and iron stained (Spurr, 1900, p. 110-112). Narrow quartz veins up to several inches wide are rich in pyrite, chalcopyrite and galena. Other zones near, but not at, contacts generally follow stratification, are similarly mineralized and contain gold and silver. Upstream, black slate is cut by granitic dikes; quartz veins carry pyrite, chalcopyrite and galena. Assay of sample with pyrite and chalcopyrite assayed 0.05 oz/ton gold and 0.15 oz/ton silver. Assay of a quartz vein sample returned 0.1 oz/ton gold and 0.25 oz/ton silver (Spurr, 1900, p.259). The basic reference was published in 1900; no more recent information is available.

Site name(s): Old Man Breccia

TY025

Site Type: Prospect

ARDFno.: TY025

Latitude: 61.94

Quadrangle: TYD-7

Longitude: 152.32

Location description and accuracy: Alaska Department of Natural Resources claim records show the prospect in a stream bed of a northern tributary to Old Man Creek, four to five miles up stream from the confluence of Old Man Creek with the Skwentna River in Sections 1 and 2, T. 21 N., R. 17 W.

Commodities:

Main: Au, Cu

Other: Fe

Ore minerals: Chalcopyrite, gold, pyrite, pyrrhotite

Gangue minerals: Carbonate, quartz

Geologic description: A float sample of pyrrhotite-chalcopyrite-quartz-pyrite, that contained several ounces of gold, lead to the discovery of a breccia in siltstone, part of Upper Jurassic and Lower Cretaceous flysch (KJs) of the Kahiltna terrane. The breccia is exposed over an area approximately 105 feet x 90 feet. Within the breccia angular clasts of argillite from less than one inch up to a few inches long occur in a matrix of well-healed milky quartz and lesser carbonate. The quartz-argillite breccia forms sinuous, sub-vertical zones around large argillite blocks. Sulfides in breccia are sparse (generally less than 1% total) and consist of pyrrhotite pods +/- pyrite and chalcopyrite, and rare coarse-grained arsenopyrite. Veins of quartz-pyrrhotite-pyrite-chalcopyrite crosscut the breccia zone and vary from a few inches to 2 feet in thickness and contain occasional specks of visible gold. No obvious alteration occurs in the hanging wall (Cominco American Incorporated, unpublished reports, 19861988).

TY026

Site Type: Prospect

ARDFno.: TY026

Latitude: 61.91

Quadrangle: TYD-7

Longitude: 152.32
Location description and accuracy: Alaska Department of Natural Resources claim records show the prospect located approximately 3000 to 3500 feet in elevation on the south side of Old Man Creek, about five miles up stream from the confluence of Old Man Creek and the Skwentna River in Section 13,T. 21N.,R. 17 W.
Commodities:
Main: Ag, Au, Mo

Other: As, Ba

Ore minerals: Arsenopyrite, chalcopyrite, gold, molybdenite, pyrite, pyrrhotite, sphalerite

Gangue minerals: Carbonate, chlorite, quartz

Geologic description: At this locality a Late Cretaceous/Early Tertiary(?) diorite is cut by shallow (10-30 degree) veins less than 1 foot to 5 foot thick, and poorly developed stockwork veins. Mineralization consists of varying amounts of quartz, chlorite, arsenopyrite, pyrite, pyrrhotite, molybdenite, and carbonate. The best gold grades are associated with zones of subparallel veins. Gold ranges from ten's of ppb to 0.122 oz/ton (Cominco American Incorporated, unpublished reports, 1986-1987). The diorite is probably one of the late Cretaceous/Early Tertiary Kichatna plutons (TKk) described by Reed and Nelson (1980) in the Talkeetna quadrangle to the north. A K-Ar age of 67.4 +/-2 m.y. suggests that these plutons may be slightly older than the 65-km belt of composite plutons to the west. The veins may be related to the diorite intrusion.
Alteration: Carbonate, pyrite, sericite, quartz
Age of mineralization: The host rock is late Cretaceous/Early Tertiary(?)diorite; the veins may be related to the diorite intrusion.
