STUDIES RELATED TO WILDERNESS

Bureau of Land Management Wilderness Study Areas

The Federal Land Policy and Management Act (Public Law 94-579, October 21, 1976) requires the U.S. Geological Survey and the U.S. Bureau of Mines to conduct mineral surveys on certain areas to determine their mineral values, if any. Results must be made available to the public and be submitted to the President and the Congress. This report presents the results of a geochemical survey of the Southern Inyo Mountains Wilderness Study Area, Inyo County, California.

INTRODUCTION

In July 1985 the U.S. Geological Survey conducted a reconnaissance

geochemical survey of the Southern Inyo County Wilderness Study Area, Inyo

County, California.

?

The U.S. Geological Survey was asked to study 27,240 acres (42.5 mi ) of

the Southern Inyo Mountains Wilderness Study Area (CA-010-056). Throughout

this report "wilderness study area" and "study area" refer only to that

acreage. The Southern Inyo Mountains Wilderness Study Area is on the western

side of the southern Inyo Mountains 5 mi east of Lone Pine, in southeastern

California (see fig. 1). Numerous graded dirt roads in Owens Valley provide

access to the western part of the study area, leading to canyons and mines

along the range front. A jeep trail, passable in four-wheel drive, runs from

Swansea to the Burgess mine and provides access to the southeastern part of

the study area. Access within the area is limited to narrow foot trails.

The study area is underlain by a sequence of intensely folded and faulted

marine sedimentary rocks of Cambrian through Triassic age, and continental

volcanic and sedimentary rocks of Triassic age. Limestone and dolomite are

the most abundant rock types in the lower part of the strati graphic sequence;

shale is more abundant in the upper part. These rocks are intruded by a

number of plutons and small granitic bodies of Jurassic and Cretaceous age.

Faulting, folding, and metamorphism have greatly deformed the stratified

rocks, especially in the proximity of the large plutons.

Elevations in the study area range from about 3,700 ft above sea level at

the base of the range in Owens Valley to 11,107 ft above sea level at the

summit of Mt. Inyo. The northern part of the study area is very steep and

rugged with relief of up to 7,400 ft. The southeastern part of the study area

is somewhat less rugged but also contains numerous steep and inaccessible

canyons. The climate is arid to semiarid, and vegetation is sparse.

METHODS OF STUDY

Sample Media

Analyses of the stream-sediment samples represent the chemistry of the rock material eroded from the drainage basin upstream from each sample site. Such information is useful in identifying those basins which contain concentrations of elements that may be related to mineral deposits. Heavy-mineral-concentrate samples provide information about the chemistry of certain minerals in rock material eroded from the drainage basin upstream from
each sample site. The selective concentration of minerals, many of which may
be ore related, permits determination of some elements that are not easily detected in stream-sediment samples.

Analyses of unaltered or unmineralized rock samples provide background geochemical data for individual rock units. On the other hand, analyses of altered or mineralized rocks, where present, may provide useful geochemical information about the major- and trace-element assemblages associated with a mineralizing system.
Sample Collection
Samples were collected at 53 sites (plate 1). At nearly all of those sites, both a stream-sediment sample and a heavy-mineral-concentrate sample were collected. Where suitable outcrop was available, rock samples were collected, and where water was available, water samples were collected. Average sampling density was about one sample site per 1 mi for the heavymineral concentrates.
Heavy-mineral-concentrate samples
Heavy-mineral-concentrate samples were collected from the same active alluvium as the stream-sediment samples. Each bulk sample was screened with a 2.0-mm (10-mesh) screen to remove the coarse material. The less than 2.0-mm fraction was panned until most of the quartz, feldspar, organic material, and clay-sized material were removed.
Sample Preparation
After air drying bromoform (specific gravity 2.8) was used to remove the remaining quartz and feldspar from the heavy-mineral-concentrate samples that had been panned in the field. The resultant heavy-mineral sample was separated into three fractions using a large electromagnet (in this case a modified Frantz Isodynamic Separator). The most magnetic material, primarily magnetite, was not analyzed. The second fraction, largely ferromagnesian silicates and iron oxides, was saved for analysis/archival storage. The third fraction (the least magnetic material which may include the nonmagnetic ore minerals, zircon, sphene, etc.) was split using a Jones splitter. One split was hand ground for spectrographic analysis; the other split was saved for mineralogical analysis. These magnetic separates are the same separates that would be produced by using a Frantz Isodynamic Separator set at a slope of 15° and a tilt of 10° with a current of 0.1 ampere to remove the magnetite and ilmenite, and a current of 1.0 ampere to split the remainder of the sample into paramagnetic and nonmagnetic fractions.
Sample Analysis
Spectrographic method
The heavy-mineral-concentrate samples were analyzed for 31 elements using semi quantitative, direct-current arc emission spectrographic methods. The analyses of heavy-mineral-concentrate samples were performed using the method of Grimes and Marranzino (1968). The elements analyzed and their lower limits of determination are listed in table 1. Spectrographic results were obtained by visual comparison of spectra derived from the sample against spectra obtained from standards made from pure oxides and carbonates. Standard concentrations are geometrically spaced over any given order of magnitude of concentration as follows: 100, 50, 20, 10, and so forth. Samples whose

concentrations are estimated to fall between those values are assigned values of 70, 30, 15, and so forth. The precision of the analytical method is approximately plus or minus one reporting interval at the 83 percent confidence level and plus or minus two reporting intervals at the 96 percent confidence level (Motooka and Grimes, 1976). Values determined for the major elements (iron, magnesium, calcium, and titanium) are given in weight percent; all others are given in parts per million (micrograms/gram). Analytical data for samples from the Southern Inyo Mountains Wilderness Study Area are listed in table 2.
ROCK ANALYSIS STORAGE SYSTEM
Upon completion of all analytical work, the analytical results were entered into a computer-based file called Rock Analysis Storage System (RASS). This data base contains both descriptive geological information and analytical data. Any or all of this information may be retrieved and converted to a binary form (STATPAC) for computerized statistical analysis or publication (VanTrump and Miesch, 1977).
DESCRIPTION OF DATA TABLES
Table 2 lists the results of analyses for the samples of heavy-mineral concentrate. For the table, the data are arranged so that column 1 contains the USGS-assigned sample numbers. These numbers correspond to the numbers shown on the site location map (plate 1). Columns in which the element headings show the letter "s" below the element symbol are emission spectrographic analyses. A letter "N" in the tables indicates that a given element was looked for but not detected at the lower limit of determination shown for that element in table 1. If an element was observed but was below the lowest reporting value, a "less than" symbol (<) was entered in the tables in front of the lower limit of determination. If an element was observed but was above the highest reporting value, a "greater than" symbol (>) was entered in the table 2 in front of the upper limit of determination. If an element was not looked for in a sample, two dashes ( ) are entered in table 2 in place of an analytical value. Because of the formatting used in the computer program that produced tables 2, some of the elements listed in these tables (Fe, Mg, Ca, Ti, Ag, and Be) carry one or more nonsignificant digits to the right of the significant digits. The analysts did not determine these elements to the accuracy suggested by the extra zeros.
