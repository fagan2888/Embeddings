It is probable that all six collections are of lower Mississippian age and belong to the Madison limestone, though they show several different faunal facies. Lots 22, 25, 26, and 36 are typical Madison faunas. Lot 21 shows too little for definite identification of the horizon. Lot 19 suggests a typical Burlington more than a typical Madison fauna, yet the Madison is in part of Burlington age, and collections from it sometimes show a markedly Burlington facies, like this one.
The Madison limestone is the most striking formation surrounding the Little Rocky Mountains. It is the encircling girdle of the mountains, in which the picturesque canyons are cut. Seen from a distance it appears like a great horizontal bed, but on closer examination it is found to be turned up at high angles and its edge cut by deep canyons. The three small outlying domes sho·wn in figure 2 are 1nade up wholly of this limestone.
JURASSIC SYSTEM.
ELLIS FOHl\fATION.
Overlying the · ~rfadison limestone in the Little Rocky Mountains is a formation made up of shale and shaly and sandy limestone (fig. .2), which was described by Weed and Pirsson. A fauna from it, ·determined by T. W. Stanton as Jurassic, consisted of the following forms:
Ammonite fragments of undetermined species. Belemnites densus Meek and Hayden. Pleuromya subcompressa Meek. Astarte meeki Stanton. Modiola subimbricata Meek. Gryphaea calceola var. nebrascensis Meek and
Hayden.
Larger collections from this formation were made by H. R. Bennett during the field season of 1916 and were identified by J. B. Reeside, jr., as follows:

Fragments of fossil.vertebrates found at 25 wic}.ely distributed localities have been submitted to J. W. Gidley, who states that the beds which contained them can not be older than Miocene or younger than early Pliocene and that they are probably upper Miocene.

Since late Pliocene or early Pleistocene time streams have been at work eroding the pre~ent valleys. The effects of this erosion can be seen in the escarpments north and south of Milk River between Tampico and Malta, where at one place 300 feet of beds belonging to the Claggett and Judith River formations, capped by late· Phocene or early Pleistocj3ne gravel, are exposed. The cutting of the river valley must have occurred early in Pleistocene time,

Overlying the gravel in the Milk River valley as well as the Flaxville gravel and all the higher benches described there is in manv places a sprinkling of glacial poulders, among which specimens of limestone from Lake Winnip_eg and of granite from the Hudson Bay regiOn are abundant.

According to Dr. Vaughan the evidence of the fossils shows that Jackson strata occur near the mines of the Georgia Kaolin Co., 2 miles southeast of Dry Branch. There is an exposure of 15 feet of soft white argillaceous marl in a small ravine one-half mile southeast of the clayworking plant, which contains Bryozoa and other fossils and is similar lithologically to the marl at Rich Hill. It lies 10 to 15 feet above the white clay beds of the Cretaceous and is overlain by 125 feet of bluish or drab lami-

Species marked * are not known from beds above the Claiborne. Pteropsis lapidosa is characteristic of the lower Claiborne.
This does indeed look like a Claiborne fauna, and with the data then available Vaughan was perfectly justified in referring these fossils to the Claiborne group; but, as we shall see later, nearly all the species checked have since been found associated with Jackson fossils. The exception to these is P~eropsis lapidosa, which elsewhere seems to be confined to the lower Claiborne. As this collection of fossils apparently is not now in the National Museum, the identifications of the species could not be checked nor could the matrix be examined to ascertain whether there had been accidental mixture of specimens from different localitie!:?.
There is some uncertainty as to the locality at which the fossils ascribed to Mossy Hill were obtained. According to Veatch and Stephen-
son/ Mossy Hill is on the Perry-Elko road 4!
miles south of Perry, a location corresponding nearly with that of Ross Hill. However, as there seems to be little doubt that the horizon is the same as that from which the writers obtained Turritella carinata and Mesalia vetusta, the exact locality is of no particular importance.

The fossils are preserved in the fonn of hollow molds or siliceous pseudomorphs, some of which ha:ve weathered out of the sandy matrix. The rock, which is an indurated facies of the: basal sand bed of the Eocene that is of widespread distribution in this part of the State, is exposed to a thickness of 3 or 4 feet but probably extends somewhat deeper. It lies not far above the Cretaceous, but the con'Otact is not exposed here.

such species as Levifusus branneri, Murex marlcsi, and Turritella clevelandia, which are typical of the Jackson deposits in Arkansas, so far east of their previously known r.ange; but their presence, as well as the general aspect of the fauna, is good evidence that the beds containing them occupy approximately the same stratigraphic position. The presence of Astrhelia burnsi, Ficus filius, Natica permunda, Leda r·egina-jaclcsonis, and Oorbula wailesiana affords strong additional evidence that the deposits are of Jackson age.

TWIGGS COUNTY.
Vicinity of Pilces Peak.-The Twiggs clay member of the Barnwell attains its greatest thickness in Twiggs County, where, at Pikes Peak, it is mined for use as fuller's earth. The n1en1ber changes considerably in character fr01n north to south within the county. The best exposm·es in the northern part are on the property of the General Reduction Co., near Pikes Peak, where there are two well-defined beds of fuller's earth in an interval of about 100 feet. The lower bed is about 45 'feet thick, the upper n1ore than 20 feet, and the ·two are separated by a bed of greenish-yellow fossiliferous sand which reaches a thickness of 30 feet. The earth in this vicinity is not calcareous, except nen.r the base, where it grades into lilnestone. Where leached and oxidized by surface water it has a pale-yellow to cream color and is extreJnely light and porous; but below the zone of oxidation it is usually dark gray and contains organic 1natter and pyrite. Farther south, in the neighborhood of Danville n.nd Westlake, for instance, the fuller's-earth bed becomes tbitmer as the underlying limestone thickens and the clay bep01nes more and more calcareous. The calcareous clay is blue or gray when unoxidized, but becomes cream-colored or yellow at the surfa.ce. As it is n1uch less pervious than the noncalcareous variety farther north, the zone of oxidation in many parts of its outcrop

are several feet thick between partings.

The whole mass of fuller's earth is cut

by joints in various directions, and iron

and manganese stains are found along

the joint planes. Some of the joints

and partings are. slickensided, showing

that slight movements, probably caused

by shrinkage, have occurred. This bed,

which is uniform in texture and com-

position and is very light and porous,

constitutes the commercially valuable

fuller's earth .... ~ . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 17

4. Dark-colored fuller's earth, almost black

when wet but becoming light gray on

drying. The dark color is probably due

to organic matter. The clay contains

visible crystals of pyrite and gives off

a strong odor of sulphur dioxide when

dried at 100° C. It also contains scat-

tered concretions of hard siliceous mate-

rial. The black layer thins to the north

and west-that is, the slope of its upper

surface follows the slope of the hill. The

line of contact with the light-colored

earth is sharp and even, but there is no

visible change in texture, and the con-

tact was observed to cut obliquely

across the sand partings (bedding

planes). It is evident that the light

earth has been derived from the dark

variety by leaching and oxidation of

pyrite and carbonaceous matter. . . . . . 5

RELATIONS OF LATE PALEOZOIC AND EARLY MESOZOIC FORMATIONS OF SOUTHWES'TERN MONTANA AND ADJACENT PARTS OF WYOMING.

By D. DALE CONDIT.

SUMMARY OF CONCLUSIONS.
The object of this paper is twofold-to present evidence found in southwestern Montana concerning the great Jurassic base-leveling and its bearing on the solution of certain stratigraphic problems Involving late Paleozoic, Triassic, and Jurassic formations, and to set forth the relations of those formations to beds in western Wyoming. The conclusions briefly stnnmarized are as follows:
Prior to the encroachment of the sea from the northwest in late Jurassic time prolonged erosion and base-leveling occurred over much of the Rocky Mountain region. From the Idaho State line near Yellowstone National Park northward to the vicinity of Helena the erosion surface thus produced truncates beds of Triassic and Carboniferous age, through a stratigraphic range of about 1,000 feet.
·The Quadrant quar~zite at the type locality in the northwestern part of Yellowstone Park is approximately equivalent to the Amsden and Tensleep formations in Wyoming. The Park City (Pennsyhranian and Permian), Dinwoody (Lower Triassic), and Chugwater (largely Triassic) of the Wyoming. section are in part represented by the Teton formation of Yellowstone Park. The quartzitic cherty basal beds of the Teton, containing the phosphate rock, are equivalent to the Phosphoria formation of Idaho, which corresponds to the upper part of the Park City formation. In western Montana north of latitude 45° 30' the overlying Triassic shaly limestone and red shale were removed by the Jurassic eros~on and the Ellis formation (Upper Jurassic) rests on the pe,rtly eroded Phosphoria formation.
FIELD WORK.
The information set forth in this paper was obtained by the writer during the seasons of 1913, 1915, and 1916. The first two years

were spent in detailed mapping of the Permian phosphate beds along the northeast ~lope of the Wind River Mountains and throughout the Owl Creek Mountains of Wyoming. A reconnaissance trip was also made on both the east and west slopes of the Big I-Iorn Mountains. In 1916 a reconnaissance examination occupying about three months was made in Montana from Helena south to Yellowstone Park and west to longitude 112°, and later in the same season a visit was made to exposures in the vicinity of Cody, Wyo. Nearly all the outcrops in Wyoming represented on the accompanying map (Pl. IX) except those near the · Idaho State line were visited, and also practically all those in the. Montana area.
FORMATIONS IN SOUTHWESTERN MONTANA DISCUSSED IN THIS PAPER.
The Madison limestone, of Mississippian age, which ranges in thickness from 200 to 2,500 feet in different parts of Montana, Idaho, and Wyoming, forms an unmistakable unit throughout the region and a convenient datum in the study of the less constant higher beds. Its slightly uneven surface is in places capped by conglomerate made up of pebbles of the Madison limestone in a sandy matrix. No generalized section of beds above the Madison that is representative of all of southwestern Montana can be made, and therefore each formation will be described briefly in turn and illustrated by stratigraphic sections measured at a number of localities.
QUADRANT QUARTZITE.
The term Quadrant was introduced by Peale 1 to designate a formation consisting of 150 feet of cherty limestones in .the upper part and 200 feet of red limestones below, overlying the Madison limestone in the vicinity

These beds, which are wholly nonthe Thaynes limestone in southeastern Idaho. marine, lie between the marine Jurassic and The paleontologic and lithologic evidence at marine Upper Cretaceous beds. On j;he basis hand does not warrant positive statements as to the relations of the upper part of the Teton to the Idaho or Wyoming sections. Exclusion from the Teton of the basal portion, equ~valent to the Phosphoria formation, leaves the higher shaly brown limestone and red beds of Triassic age to which the name Teton could be applied, but this seems inadvisable for several reasons, one of which is that the name has not been used for areas outside of Yellowstone Park. It is therefore believed that the use of the name Teton will be discontinued when enough additional field work shall have been ·done both in Montana and southeastern ~daho to permit the proper appli.cation of formation names now in· use in Idaho and Wyoming.

ELLIS FORMATION.
In late Jurassic time, subsequent to a long erosion interval during which there was more or less tilting of the strata, a subsidence brought in from the northwest an arm of the sea in which were deposited the sediments of the Ellis formation. The rocks consist of fossiliferous greenish shale and limestone and a variable amount of rust-brown weathering sandstone and conglomerate. At Elkhorn mining camp, near Helena, and for 70 miles to the south, the Ellis beds rest on n1ore or less disturbed strata of the Phosphoria formation, but farther south th~ Ellis and Phosphoria are separated by Triassic shaly beds that thicken southward and constitute a portion of the Teton formation. The Ellis beds are about 200 feet thick in Yellowstone Park but thicken northward and northwestward to about 400 feet in the Livingston and Philipsburg regions. It is suspected that the Ellis represents only the basal portion of the several thousand feet of the marine Jurassic beds in southeastern Idaho but corresponds closely with the Sundance formation of Wyoming.

The most conspicuous beds of the Kootenai are the gray gastropod limestone and a bed of conglomeratic sandstone in about the middle of the formation, the pebbles of which are dark chert. Both the beds are reported at 1nany places in western Montana, in Yellowstone Park, and in the adjacent country in Wy01ning. They form hogbacks pr.ojecting above the poorly exposed shaly red beds of the Kootenai and the dark shale of the overlying Colorado formation.

INDIAN CREEK, MADISON VALLEY.
Indian Creek joins Madison River from the east a few miles south of Cameron. Its branches drain a rugged area containing nur'nerous alpine peaks in the heart of the Madison Range. From a densely timbered basin in the Mesozoic rocks the upper waters of the stream unite and flow westward through a sharp canyon (Pl. XI, A) in pre-Cambrian rocks bordered on the east by Paleozoic rocks that dip steeply northeastward. In sees. 20 and 21, T. 8 S., R. 2 E., on the north canyon wall (loca~­ ity 2, Pl. IX), there are complete exposures of strata from the Madison limestone to the top of the Kootenai, stratigraphically nearly 2,000 feet higher. A fault of large displacement cuts the lower Paleozoic strata at tlus point but does not affect the sequence of the higher strata. A con9-ensed section of beds measured here is given below.

It has been shown by the writer 1 that although the Chugwater red beds are in large part Triassic, the lower portion in the Big Horn Mountains and elsewhere in central Wyoming is of earlier Triassic, Permian, and Pennsylvanian age and was deposited contemporaneously with the marine Triassic (Dinwoody) and Permian and Pennsylvanian (Park City) beds to the west.

AMSDEN FORMATION AND TENSLEEP SANDSTONE.

The Amsden formation, which rests on the Madison limestone, is somewhat similar in lithology to the lower portion of the. Quadrant quartzite of Montana, with which it is correlated, but at no place has ~t been found to contain richly fossiliferous beds, such as have been discovered in Montana. In the western part of the Wind River Mountains the Amsden consists of massive white sandstone at the

1 Condit, D. D., Relations of the Embar and Chugwater formations in central Wyoming: U. S. Geol. Survey Prof. Paper 98, pp. 263-270, 1916.

base, overlain by interbedded gray to yellowish shale, sandstone, and thin beds of lin1estone. Some of the shale beds are deep red.
The Tensleep consists almost entirely of sandstone, with a few interbedded dolomitic layers that locally contain marine fossils. The beds correspond so closely in position, thickness, and lithology with the upper portion of the Quadrant quartzite that there is no question as to their correlation. It is suggested also that the Tensleep may be in part equivalent to the Weber quartzite of southeastern Idaho and Utah.
PARK CITY FORMATION.
Above the Tensleep sandstone in the Wind River Mountains is a sequence of prevailingly calcareous beds correlated by Blackwelder 2 with the Park City formation of Utah on the basis of paleontologic and lithologic evidence. The Park City beds, together with overlying calcareous brownish shaly beds of Triassic age, constitute the Embar formation of Darton,!J who applied this name to strata believed to be of ''Permo-Carboniferous" age, lying between the Tensleep sandstone and Chugwater red beds at a locality in the Owl Creek Mountains. This grouping into one formation of beds of Pennsylvanian, Permian, and Triassic age and of widely different lithology is comparable to the grouping of the beds in the Teton formation of Yellowstohe Park, and the only reason for retaining Embar as a formation name is its convenience as a term for use in areas where the Dinwoody and Park City can not be differentiated.
The portion of the Embar formation equivalent to the Park City beds in the Wind River and Owl Creek mountains (see Pl. XIII, B) consists largely of limestone with calcareous shale and nodular chert. The general sequence is as follows:
Generalized section of Park City formation in Wind River and Owl Creek mountains, Wyo.
Siliceous greenish limestone grading up into gray resist- . ant limestone, with abundant fossils including Derbya, Pseudomonotis, Leioclema, and Spiriferina pulchra.

The thickness of strata r~1noved by Jurassic erosion in northern :Montana n1ay have been 2,000 feet, if the Chugwater red beds once extended over that area. The extent to which the Chugwater was eroded in Wyon1ing is not evident, but it seems probable that in the westcentral part of the State, where the beds are 1,400 feet thick, they remain ahnost intact, and that the upper portion, including the gypseous beds, may be in part a product of Jurassic sedin1entation.
The disposition of the great n1ass of material .stripped fron1 the northern area is a matter of

speculation, but in the writer's op1n1on this erosion n1ay have furnished the sediments of the shale and sandstone series of southeastern Idaho lying between the n1arine Lower Triassic (Thaynes limestone) and marine Upper Jurassic (Twin Creek limestone). It is probable that in the 1neanwhile the Wyoming area, a low, nearly level plain, which was intermittently occupied by small bodies of water and in which neither erosion nor deposition ofo considerable magnitude occurred, furnished the conditions necessary for the formation of extensive but variable gypsum and li1nestone beds.

PURPOSE AND SCOPE OF THE PAPER.

The region in central and northeastern Texas

and southern Oklahoma known as the Black and Grand prairies abounds i~ features of in-

terest to physiographers, geologists, and pale-

ontologists, and the pioneer investiO'ators of

this region must have experienced b renewed

satisfaction in each day's exploration. The

reports of Joseph A. Taff, Robert T. Hill, and

others, published chiefly under the auspices of

State and Federal surveys, represent with ap-

proximate accuracy at most places the general

distribution of the outcrops of the formations

in this region, and contain detailed descrip-

tions of many sections that constitute a

mine of useful information. The reader of the

present paper is urged, therefore, to hold as

most important 'the general excellence of the

earlier reports of these authors and to relegate

the inaccuracies and mistakes to which his

attention will be called to the relatively unim-

portant place in which they belong, remembering at the same time 'that a futur~ generation

of investigators may find our own shortcomings

11s great as those we now criticize.

rrhe present report treats of the area shown

in Plate XVII, which includes Grayson, Fan-

nin, Lamar, Delta, I-Iunt, and Collin counties 'I'ex., and the southern parts of Marshall and'

Bryan counties, Okla. It is based on the re-

sults of studies carried on during several brief

field seasons between the years 1911 and 1917

inclusive. The results are by no means final:

but enough facts have been obtained to justify IHill,R.T.,GeographyandgeologyoftheBlackandGrandprairies

The divisions recognized by Taff in the Tishomingo and Atoka quadrangles, Okla., which correspond to the Denison beds of Hill, include in ascending order the Kiamichi formation, equivalent to the "Kiamitia" clay of Hill; the Caddo limestone, equivalent to the Duck Creek formation and the Fort Worth limestone; the Bokchito formation, equivalent to the Denton subgroup and the Weno subgroup (Marietta or Weno fonnation and Pawpaw beds) of Hill; and the Bennington limestone, equivalent to Hill's Pottsboro subgroup (Main Street limestone and Grayson marl). (See Pl. XVIII.)

The Kiamichi clay is named for Kiamichi River, on which it is typically exposed in Choctaw County, Okla. In Grayson County the Kiamichi clay, which includes all the beds between the Goodland and Duck Creek formations, is 40 or 50 feet thick and consists chiefly 9f dark carbonaceous shaly clay, with thin platy layers of siliceous limestone interbedded with the clay in the lower few feet and with thin layers of gray impure fossiliferous limestone in the upper 10 or 15 feet. The writer has not seen the full thickness of the formation, and the description is based partly on the statements of Taff and Hill. The section at Thomson Ferry, given below, which includes the upper part of the formation, was examined by the writer. (See Pl. XX.) This locality is on the north limb of the Denison anticline.

Mr. Stanton informe~\ me that although Mollusca were rarely found in the Mowry, two localities on the southeastern border of the Big Horn Mountains had yielded ammonoids probably belonging to the genus jjfetoicoceras, and one of them yielded Inoceramus.
