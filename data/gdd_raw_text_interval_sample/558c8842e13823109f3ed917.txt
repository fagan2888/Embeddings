The dldelphodontine palaeoryctid Dzdelphodus absarokae IS probably ancestral to the younger and smaller D oltulens The leptictids Produzcodon and Polaezctops are more closely related to each other than was recently suggested by M J Novacek Two Willwood specunens show crossmg characters between these genera Polaezctops matthewz Novacek IS probably conspecific w1th P multzcuspzs, and the type of Polaezctops pmeyenszs IS removed from synonymy with Produzcodon tauncmerez and IS placed m Polaezctops bzcuspzs Statistical studles mdlcate that there were five early Eocene species of Polaeosmopa. P vetemma, P dzdelphozdes, P lutreola, P mcerta, sp nov , and a large, undescnbed form from the Lost Cabm Member of the Wmd River Formation P lutreola IS restncted to Graybulhan faunas, and Student's t tests show that P dzdelphozdes dlffers statistically from P vetemma R M West's review of apatemyids IS cnticiZed from several viewpomts, four species of Apatemys are recogmzed m the Willwood fauna A chardmz, A bellulus, A kayz, and A sp , cf A rodens

INTRODUCTION
HISTORY AND PURPOSE OF INVESTIGATION
Cope (1881) frrst described a specimen of a proteuthenan from the Willwood Formation of the Bighorn Basin of northwest Wyoming (Deltathenum absarokae (Didelphodus Cope, 1882; Matthew, 1918, p. 579)). Since that time, at least 500 additional specimens have been recovered from these productive rocks. Matthew (1901, 1918) and Jepsen (1930a) described the best Willwood material in the American Museum and Princeton University collections, respectively, and a few additional Willwood specimens were recorded by West (1973), Krishtalka (1976a, b), and Novacek (1977). Until recently, however, the vast majonty of these fossils were undescribed. The largest single collection (about 215 specimens from the Sand Creek facies) exists in the University of Wyoming Geological Museum (No Water fauna) Most of these were discussed by Bown (1979), who named two new genera (Plagzoctenodon and Plagioctenmdes) and one new species (Leipsanolestes slmpsoni) of insectivores. The No Water fauna was, m addition to the Four Mile fauna of northwestern Colorado (McKenna, 1960a), only the second comprehensive record of early WasatchIan insectivores and proteutherians
Another large sample (about 180 specimens) In the Yale Peabody Museum was collected by Yale field parties under the direction of E. L Simons (during 1961-65, 1968-72, 1974, 1975), and David Schankler (during 1976, 1977) This collection was obtained from numerous localities throughout the lower seven-eighths (660 m) of the Willwood Formation and contains both early (Graybullian age) and rmddle (Lysitian age) Wasatcruan insectivores and proteuthenans These mammals have thus far not been found in Willwood rocks that yield Lambdothenum (Lostcabiruan age).
This paper contains a documentation of the Willwood Proteuthena and Insectivora in the Yale Peabody Museum collection, a revisiOn of some of the forms in the No Water fauna, and discussions of possible phylogenetic mterpretations of these and related forms. The Willwood record of these animals is an impressive one and serves adequately to bndge the gap between known late Paleocene and Clarkforklan forms and those of the late early Eocene and rmddle Eocene. The Willwood sample compnses at least 18 genera, which are contained m at least 30 species, of which three new genera and seven new species are described here. It is the most diverse record of the Proteuthena and Insectivora in the North American Paleocene or Eocene.

PRELIMINARY FAUNAL ZONATION OF THE WILLWOOD FORMATION

A comprehensive picture of the vertebrate faunal zonation of the Willwood Formation is still In progress, however, several recent studies have already contributed to a clearer understanding of Willwood biostratigraphy (for example, Neasham and Vondra, 1972; Gingerich, 1974a, 1976, 1977; Gingerich and Rose, 1977, Gingerich and Simons, 1977; Rose, 1978, Bown, 1975, 1979) Schankler (1980) has related many of the 400-odd Yale Willwood localities in the central Bighorn Basin to a measured stratigraphic sectiOn Bown (1979, 1980) has done the same for approximately 250 sites in the southern and southeastern Bighorn Basin, and ongoing studies of P. D Gingerich and K. D Rose at the Uruversity of Michigan have Incorporated data from another 250-odd localities In the Clark's Fork Basin Studies of Willwood mammals at each of these sites are in various stages of preparation, however, enough is now known to offer a prehmmary picture of the biOstratigraphic relationships of Willwood proteutherians and insectivores
Traditionally, the Willwood Formation has been separated into three poorly defined uruts: the "Gray Bull Member" (faunal term: "Graybulhan"), a taxon-range zone typified by Homogalax protapznnus; the "Lysite equivalent" (faunal term: "Lysitian"), an as yet unsubstantiated faunal assemblage zone, presently characterized only by the range of overlap of the helaletid Heptodon and the adapid Pelycodus jarrovn, and by the absence of Homogalax, and the "Lost Cabm equivalent" (faunal term· "Lostcabmian"), which, in the Willwood Formation, IS presently distinguished only by the presence of the palaeothere Lambdothenum (Wood and others, 1941; Van Houten, 1945). Wood and others (1941) were apparently unaware that these divisions in the Bighorn Basm have no rock-stratigraphic meaning The designatiOn of "beds", "Member", or "equivalent" for
the Gray Bull, Lysite, and Lost Cabin uruts m that basin is, therefore, inappropriate because they cannot be distinguished without an examination of their contained faunas. Indeed, the faunal distinctiveness of the lithologically distinguished Lysite and Lost Cabin Members of the Wmd River Formation is poorly understood in their type areas m spite of several recent studies, and Homogalax, the supposed index fossil of the Gray Bull, occurs in positively younger rocks in southern Wyoming and in association with Heptodon in at least twenty Willwood faunules.
In this paper, the following faunal-stratigraphic divisions are recognized for Willwood rocks and faunas and have been superimposed on existing established nomenclature to avoid confusion

4 PROTEUTHERIA AND INSECTIVORA, WILLWOOD FORMATION, WYO
that might arise if a new terminology were established without faunal documentation at this time These divisions, which are documented in unpubhshed data of Schankler and Bown, facilitate discussion of the relative faunal ages of the Willwood proteuthenans and insectivores, are based on unpublished faunal studies of more than 600 Willwood localities, and will be revised as subsequent investigations warrant. Measurements (in meters) are from the base of the Willwood Formation in the Elk Creek section (Schankler, 1980), central Bighorn Basin.

signed to this species, even though the Lysitian specimens are mtermediate in size between the types of D. absarokae and D alndens This intermediacy of size was also recorded by Guthne (1967a) for the Lysite Member (Wmd River Formation) sample, from the Wind River Basin.
In the central Bighorn Basin, D absarokae is known from the lower Gray Bull to the upper part of the Lysite zones. Its absence from the Lost Cabin zone is probably due to relatively poor samples from these localities, as it is a rare species even in the faunally better represented lower horizons. The few specimens that are available tend to show a decrease in tooth size up section.
The Willwood sample has been combined with other early and middle Eocene samples m a time versus size plot in figures 2 and 3. The measure of size IS adapted from that in Gingerich (1976). As can be seen from the figures, D absarokae and D alndens are clearly separated in size only at the end points of the temporal range This relationship was earlier observed by Van Valen (1966, p. 32) and Guthrie (1967a, p. 13). A specimen from the Lost Cabin Member of the Wind River Formation (MCZ 3461), assigned by Van Valen (1966) to D. alndens, is m the rmddle of the size range of the Lysite zone specimens found in the Willwood Formation and the Almagre faunal sample in the San Jose Formation of New Mexico. The latter sample, presumably of Lostcabinian age, was assigned by Van Valen (1966) to D absarokae and is interesting in that it contmns an Individual that is almost as large as the largest of the Graybullian specimens Van Valen's argument that D alndens is not an anagenetic descendant of D absarokae was based largely on the existence of both species in a smgle fauna, that of the Lost Cabin Member of the Wmd River Formation The presence of D absarokae in this fauna was indicated by a single specimen (US National Museum 18433), whose correct assignment has been properly questioned by Guthrie (1971). Whether it is a specimen of Dldelphodus or not, It is certmnly not separable from other Lostcabrman specimens of D alndens on the basis of size, which, according to Van Valen (1966), IS the only valid criterion for distinguishing lower molars of the two species. The differences in morphology are of degree rather than kind. Although we do not here recommend synonymy of the two species of Dldelphodus, we do observe that the two species are not very discrete entities and that D alndens, in all hkelihood, is a descendant of a population of D absarokae
The Willwood sample adds virtually nothing to Van Valen's (1966) treatment of the morphology of the genus other than to record a few variatiOns. In the two Lysite zone specimens where P1 IS known, it IS two rooted, with the antenor root displaced labially. In the only other

specimen that preserves this tooth (YPM 23729 from the upper Gray Bull zone), it appears to be single rooted. In the four specimens that preserve P4, the development of the metaconid varies from very weak to very strong and in some specimens it IS almost equal to the protoconid in size. There is, however, no correlation of -this character

with stratigraphic position. The pattern is as follows: lower Gray Bull zone, metaconid moderate; middle Gray Bull zone, metaconid very strong; upper Gray Bull zone, metaconid weak, Lysite zone, metaconid very weak.
Upper teeth of Dzdelphodus are very rare, and the only vanatwn observed in the sample at hand is the absence of a parastyle on the P4's of two middle Gray Bull zone specimens and the presence of a strong parastyle on one specimen from the upper Gray Bull zone

Novacek (1977) listed the followmg as shared denved characters of the leptlctld Palaezctops that distinguished it from the more generalized Produreodon:
1. P5' s (traditionally P4) and upper molars are more bunodont, being more anteroposteriorly elongate and transversely compressed, with lower, more bulbous paracones, metacones, and protocones.
2. Parastylar spurs on M2- 3 are not promi nent, and ectoflexi are relatively shallow.
3 Hypocones are well developed, being more than half the height of the protocones.
4. Conules are situated labially at the base of the paracone and metacone.
5 Molar trigonids are not greatly elevated. 6. P5 paraconids are well developed. 7. The paracone on P4 is moderately to
greatly enlarged With respect to these characters, the present reVIew of early Eocene leptlctids m the YPM collection and comparison of these specimens with type specimens and casts of the types and other specimens of Prodiacodon tauncznerez, Palaeictops bzcuspis, and Palaezctops multicuspzs leads to the following observations: 1. The number of upper dentitions of either Produreodon or Palaezc-
tops Is very small, and generalizations about the characteristics of the upper teeth of these taxa must be made with caution. Scatter diagrams (figs. 4, 5) of the length to width of the upper molars indicate that teeth m the type of Palaezctops bzcuspzs are only slightly less transversely broad than are those of the type

or referred specimens of Prodwcodon tauncmerez, and that the type of Palaezctops matthewz has upper molars that are wider than in either of the latter Upper molars of Paleocene Prodzacodon are more transverse than any early Eocene species of
Palaeictops. 2. The ectoflexi of the type of Prodwcodon tauncznerez are deeper
than in the type of Palaecztops bzcuspzs; however, a referred specimen of P bzcuspzs figured by Guthne (1971) has an M2 ectoflexus that IS intermediately deep between these types. 3. A specimen from the Lysite biostratigraphic zone of the Willwood Formation combines several characters of both genera and is typified by its large tooth size in conJunction with transversely broad upper molars, twinned paraconules, and a large hypocone (nearly two-thirds the height of the protocone). 4. The conules of the few specrmens of upper molars are situated more lingually in Prodwcodon tauncznerez, as observed by Novacek (1977). 5 The type specimens of the three descnbed species of Palaezctops from the early Eocene are very worn, and it is difficult to accurately Judge the relative degree of elevation of the molar tngonids Guthrie's (1971) referred specimen of P. bicuspzs does not appear to have trigoruds that are relatively less elevated than in most specimens of Prodiacodon tauricznerez. 6. The P5 (traditionally P4) paracorud is well developed In the type and referred specimens of Prodwcodon tauncznerez. The paracorud appears to be better developed In Palaezctops species because of the larger tooth size and because the anterior portion of the trigonid is slightly more elongate (relates more to P bzcuspzs than to other species) This feature also gives the tooth a relatively less elevated appearance with respect to Prodwcodon

The conclusiOn reached from these observations is that the genus Palaezctops, although probably constitutmg a natural group, is not nearly so dentally distmct from early Eocene Prodiacodon as Novacek (1977) believed. In particular, Prodwcodon tauncmerez of the
early Eocene seems to be at least as closely related fu Palaezctops
bzcuspzs, in an ancestral-descendant way, as it is to Its probable ancestral and collateral cogeners of the Paleocene. Detailed understandmg of this lmeage, however, is hampered by the paucity of specimens from the critical upper Gray Bull and Lysite zones. It seems hkely that early Wasatchian P tauncznerez, persistmg Into Lysitian time, also may have given rise to a second lineage. This line led to Palaezctops
Novacek's (1977) new species Palaezctops matthewz is probably conspecific with Palaeictops multicuspzs As Novacek noted, the two

Discussion.-Prodzacodon tauncinerez is the second most common species of a proteutherian or an insectivore m the Gray Bull biostratigraphic zone of the Bighorn Basin. The type specimen (PU 13104) was recovered from a shale "pocket" south of Dorsey Creek in the central part of the Bighorn Basin (Jepsen, 1930a), and this locality is thought to be near YPM locality 295, in the middle Gray Bull zone. In the Bighorn Basin Lysite zone, P tauricznerez is represented by only one or possibly two specimens For the most part, it appears to be replaced in these beds by the larger and more abundant leptictid Palaeictops bicuspzs.
Outside the Bighorn Basin, Prodzacodon tauncinerez is known from the Powder River local fauna, from rocks of early Wasatchian age at Bitter Creek, Wyo., and from the Four Mile fauna of northwestern Colorado. Meas-qrements given by Novacek for AMNH 80023 from the Four Mile fauna are either typographical errors or indicate a species other than P. tauncinerei. In this specimen, the talonid width of M1 and the trigonid width of M2 are anomalously small and large, respectively.
Novacek (1977) synonymized the type of Palaezctops pzneyensis with Prodzacodon tauncznerei, notmg the larger size of the former but a general similarity of morphology. As discussed previously, the differences between Prodiacodon and Palaezctops are not great, and what differences do exist (for example, placement of conules on the upper molars and elongation of the P5 trigonid) cannot be observed m the type of Palaezctops pzneyenszs because they are not preserved m that specimen. A scatter diagram of length versus trigonid width of M2 for early Eocene leptictids (fig. 7) shows that the type of P. pzneyenszs from the La Barge fauna (Lostcabinian age) is most closely associated in thls character with specimens from the Lysite Member of the Wind River Formation that were referred to P pineyenszs by Guthrie (1967a), and with specimens from the Lysite zone of the Willwood Formation. The two Lysite zone populations are significantly different from the largely Gray Bull sample of Prodzacodon tauncinerez in both length and width (Lysite zone: length t=7.92, n=24; p=0.0001, width t=8.12, n=24, p=0.0001; Lysite Member, Wind River Formation: length t=814, n=20, p=O 0001, width t=4.92, n=20; p=O 0001; see table 1). Similar results were obtained from analyses of the dimensions of M1, except for the length comparisons of specimens from the Lysite Member of the Wmd River Formation to P tauricznerez, in which case they do not differ significantly (t=l.18, n=10, p=0.25). Perhaps this lack of difference is due to the small sample size from the Wind River Formation, which appears to include only specimens in the lower end of the size range of M1 length.

D'tscusswn.-Two specimens from the middle Gray Bull zone of the central Bighorn Basin Willwood Formation have a morphology distinct from that of contemporary Prodzacodon taunc'tnere't. The specimens fall Within the size range of that species (text figs 6, 7), though
the M2's are shghtly more robust. The most distmctive characters, however, are the very large entoconulid on P4 (P5 of Novacek, 1977) through M8, and the colineanty of the remaining talonid cusps. These characters are contrasted with a weak to absent entoconulid and a hypoconulid that is more posterior than the entoconid and hypoconid
in typical P taunc'tnerei. Both specimens are from a single locality (YPM loc. 290) where
P taunc'tnere't is not known. A third specimen of a leptictid from tlus site (YPM 26026) is missing the lingual portion of the tooth, render-
ing specific identification impossible. Locality 290 has a number of unusual faunal elements; for example, there is a very lugh abundance of the otherwise rare dermopteran Plagiomene multwusp'ts. Presence of this fossil in abundance indicates the locality might represent an
unusual Willwood ecology. This insulanty of occurrence, coupled With the possibility that Prodzacodon sp. might be geographically sympatric with, but ecologically distmct from, P tauncinere't, has here led to separation of the species on characters that otherwise
might be attributed to intraspecific variation

D'tscusswn.-The type of Palaewtops bicusp'ts IS from the Lost Cabin Member of the Wmd River Formation, though all referred specimens from the Willwood Formation (Van Houten, 1945; Novacek, 1977) are from older rocks. Scatter diagrams of length versus trigorud width of M1 and M2 of the Lost Cabin Member of the Wind River sample and the sample from the Lysite zone in the Bighorn Basin overlap considerably (figs. 6, 7). The means for the Bighorn Basin sample are slightly smaller in most dimensions, but the differences are not significant (table 1). The means of the Willwood sample are intermediate between those of the Wind River Lost Cabin Member sample assigned toP bwusp'ts by Guthrie (1971) and m the Lysite Member sample assigned by the same author (1967a) to P pmeyens'ts. The Willwood sample from the Lysite biostratigraphic

20 PROTEUTHERIA AND INSECTIVORA, WILLWOOD FORMATION, WYO
zone is significantly different from the Lysite Member sample only in the dimension of M1 length (see text on previous page), though the Lysite Member sample is significantly different from that of the Lost Cabin Member in both M1 and M2 length.
Retention of the name P ''p.,neyens'ts" for specimens from the Lysite Member of the Wind River Formation would imply that two hneages of leptictines were present in the middle and late Wasatchian; whereas, the combined stratigraphic and morphologic evidence points to the existence of a single lineage that showed an increase in indiVIdual size through time. Palae'tctops bndgeri, a probable middle Eocene member of this lineage, is larger than Lost Cabin Member P b'tcusp'ts. The type specimen of P ''p.,neyensis" from the La Barge fauna is an individual from the small end of this stratigraphically controlled size spectrum.
If Palaeictops ''p'tneyensis" is distmct from P b'tcuspis, as suggested in 1977 by Novacek (although not a synonym of Prodwcodon tauncinerei), a southerly migration of these two species may have taken place. Palae'tctops bicuspis first appears in the Lysite zone of the Willwood Formation and occurs in the younger, more southerly Wind River Basin Lost Cabin Member, where it was apparently absent during Lysitian time. P ''pineyens'ts" first occurs in the Lysite Member of the Wind River Formation. The species disappears there in Lostcabinian time, but does occur in the Lostcabinian La Barge fauna of the northern Green River Basin. Alternatively, this same evidence could be interpreted as the southerly migration of a single species that had a north-to-south size cline

M2 talonid generally much narrower than trigonid (YPM 25506 and 25892), and trigonid relatively as wide as in P veterrima and P. d'tdelphoides
D'tscusswn.-As early as 1918, Matthew observed that all the large Willwood specimens of Palaeosinopa could not be reasonably accomodated in P. veterrima. He assigned the smaller, less robust specimens to P. d'tdelphmdes and remarked that they might eventually prove to be variants of P veterrima. McKenna (1960a) and Gazin (1962) also recorded a medium-size species of Palaeos'tnopa in the Four Mile and Bitter Creek faunas, respectively. Van Valen (1967), in a discussion of Paleocene pantolestids, grouped these specimens together in a new species that he designated Palaeosinopa sp. E, distinct from P. d'tdelphmdes. Delson (1971), in his examination of the pantolestids in the Powder River local fauna, decided that the three species were merely populations of a single species that were dispersed over a wide geographic area. He referred both P vetemma and Palaeos'tnopa sp. E toP d'tdelphoides.
After examining the Willwood collection of Palaeosinopa in the Peabody Museum and American Museum collections, the specimens referred toP. sp. E by Van Valen, and a few specimens from the Wind River Basin earlier referred toP. d'tdelphoides, we conclude that there are at least five Eocene species of Palaeos'tnopa. P. veterrima, P didelpho'tdes, P 'tncerta, sp. nov., P lutreola, and a new large species, incorrectly referred to P. veterrima (CM 24042) by Guthrie (1971) Evidence for this viewpoint is largely derived from scatter distnbutions and on statistical data on the ranges and coefficients of variation of these samples.
A scatter diagram of length versus trigonid width of M1 (fig. 9) shows that the Willwood specimens represent three groups: P lutreola on the small end, P. veterrima on the large end, and P incerta in the rmddle. A snmlar plot for M2 (fig. 10) less clearly separates these groups, possibly owing to three specimens with very wide trigonids. When length is plotted against talonid width for M2 and M1 (figs. 11, 12), the separation is more distinct for M2 but remains the

pass the entire P. incerta-P vetemma complex (P dtdelphmdes was excluded from this histogram). Unpublished data of P D. Gingerich and D. A. Winkler and of David Schankler shows that the normal range for both extant and fossil species is between 0.35 and 0.45 natural log units. This is approximately the range for each of the two included species, though that of P. tncerta Is somewhat less, possibly due to the small sample size.
All the Wmd River Basin specimens (except CM 24042) could be assigned to P dtdelphoides without increasing the coefficient of variation (6.3 for M1W) beyond that probable for a single-species. The three smallest specimens have provisionally been referred to P in-

certa. The reinclusion of these specimens in P. duielphmdes would remove the record of P. incerta from the Lost Cabin Member of the Wind River Formation but not from all rocks of Lostcabinian age. The San Jose specimen still falls beyond the range for P. didelphoides. Whichever interpretation is correct, P. didelphmdes is not now known from early or middle Wasatchian faunas, and it is not identified as such in the present scheme because its size range overlaps the upper part of that for P incerta and the lower part of that for P. veterrima, without wholly encompassing either.
Palaeosinopa didelphoides is probably a descendant of either P zncerta or P. veterrima. If the three small CM specimens are included in P. didelphoides, then that species is probably derived from P. incerta; if they are excluded, then derivation from P. veterrima is more plausible.
Overall time versus size plots for M2 and M1 are presented in figures 14 and 15. The vagueness of these plots is related to the fact that the size measure (a modification of Gingerich, 1974b) discriminates best when changes in size are unaccompanied by changes in shape. In this instance, there is a shape change between P incerta and P veterrima, and the latter also is more robust.

porally wide ranging of Willwood species of this genus. It is known from more than fifty specimens from localities in the lower Gray Bull through Lysite zones. The other two species of Willwood Palaeosznopa are, at present, known only from the Gray Bull zone. The absence of P veterrima from the richly fossiliferous level at 645 m probably means that this species became extinct in the Bighorn Basin towards the end of Lysitian time. Its absence in the Lost Cabin biOstratigraphic zone of that basin is, therefore, probably real and not merely due to the rarity of the species or to a paucity of fossils. Outside the

Bighorn Basin, P. veterrima, as defined in this paper, 1s known only from two isolated teeth from the Powder River local fauna (AMNH 56224 and 56225)
As mentioned earlier, P veterrima is considered distinct from P. duielphmdes, a species shown to occupy only the lower half of the size range of P. veterrima. The means of the lengths of M2 do not differ significantly (5.48 for P veternma; 5.34 for P duJ,elphmdes, from
Guthrie, 1971). The mean for the w1dth of M2 of P dldelphoides (3.91) is, however, significantly smaller than that for P veternma (4.37), with a probability of less than 0.001 (t=5 91, n=28) that the two samples are from the same statistical population, and that the difference observed is entirely due to stochastic effects. Similar results are obtained from an analysis of M1 The difference in tooth lengths is not

ORDER PROTEUTHERIA

29

significant, whereas the difference in width is (p=0.01, t=2.76,

n=24). If the specrmens referred toP lutreola by Guthne (1971) are

included in the P d1,delphozdes sample, the results are substantially

the same, although the level of significance is more in line with that

obtained for M2• This level of significance might indicate that the entire Wind River Formation sample belongs to a single species Which-

ever case is correct, P. didelphozdes has been demonstrated to differ

significantly in some measures from P veternma when the species

are considered as populations. P. d1,delphoides has been shown to be

shghtly less robust than P veternma, as indicated by Matthew

(1918), even though the measurements he gave for individual speci-

mens mdicate the reverse (a point noted by Gazin, 1962).

The specimen (CM 24042) referred to P veternma by Guthrie

(1971) is here considered to be representative of a new, larger but less

robust species. It falls well outside the boundary of P. veternma in

a scatter diagram and is not encompassed in the range of the

loge(LXW) size measure (0.17 natural log units larger than the

largest specimen of P veterrima). Although there is considerable

vanation in the shape of M1 in P veternma, the width-to-length ratio of CM 24042 of 0 58 lies more than 3.5 standard deviations from the

mean of that for all Willwood specimens of P veternma (X=0.75,

s=0.048, range=0.67-0.84).

The upper molars of P veternma also show considerable variation

in shape. This variation can be seen in the condition of the cingulum

on M1 and M2• In most specimens, the cingulum is closely appressed

to the body of the tooth with the precingula and postcingula being

disJunct at the lingual margin. In one specimen (YPM 23475),

however, the cingulum is nearly complete, although narrow, and in

another (YPM 27216), the postcingulum is expanded with a slight

median ridge and the precmgula and postcingula are completely con-

Discussion -Palaeosinopa lutreola is known from rocks of early Graybullian age in the Powder River Basm, the Clark's Fork Basin, and the Bighorn Basin (both No Water and Elk Creek section faunules). In the fauna of the Elk Creek section, it also occurs in the middle and upper Gray Bull biostratigraphic zones (the type is from the upper Gray Bull zone of the Elk Creek section). P. lutreola is the

II

30 PROTEUTHERIA AND INSECTIVORA, WILLWOOD FORMATION, WYO
smallest and least common of Palaeosinopa species, and its absence from rocks of the Lysite and Lost Cabin zones in the central Bighorn Basin may be due either to its absence or rarity.
As mentioned earlier, the two specimens from the Lost Cabin Member of the Wind River Formation, referred by Guthrie (1971) to P lutreola, are well outside the range for this species and are more properly assigned to P lncerta or possibly P dldelphoides. YPM 26604 and specimens referred by Bown (1979) to P cf. lutreola are considerably larger than the type specimen but still are within the possible range for this species and are provisionally referred to it here.
Famlly APATEMYIDAE
COMMENTS ON APA TEMYS MARSH, 1872
Analysis of the genus Apatemys has been plagued by the paucity of specimens available for study. This shortage of specimens has not, however, precluded the publication of major reviews of Apatemys and the Apatemyidae in recent years, one from a pnncipally morphological viewpoint (McKenna, 1963), and another utilizing the biometric approach (West, 1973). The major emphasis in both of these and earlier works on apatemyids has been the attempt to identify consistent and useful characters that allow meaningful separation of this genus into species. McKenna (1960a) recorded two species of Apatemys in the early Wasatchian Four Mile fauna and divided the majority of early Eocene apatemyids into two groups. The first of
these was believed to be characterized by '' * * * a reduced, single-
rooted P4, a strongly developed fossa beneath P4, and two major
mental foramina * * *," and the second group by "* * * an unre-
duced, semimolariform, double-rooted P4, a generally weak or totally
absent fossa beneath P4, and a single major mental foramen * * *."
Guthrie (1967a), in discussing Apatemys whltaken, demonstrated that the taxonomic utility of the number of mental foramina breaks down within a single species. Robinson (1966), in reviewing the Huerfano fauna, suggested a possible synonymy between the smallest and largest Bridgerian species of Apatemys: A bellulus and A. rodens.
The most recent and comprehensive review of the apatemyids was published by West (1973). Using the characters cited by McKenna (1960a, 1963) and tooth size distributions, West believed that no correlations could be made and that no unified groups exist within the genus. Consequently, West synonymized all Wasatchian and Bridgerian species of Apatemys with the earliest described species, A bellus. The present study is not as exhaustive in terms of the number

ORDER PROTEUTHERIA

31

of specimens studied as was West's, and so in a few instances West's analytical data was used. In using his data, West's-study was examined critically and the following notes were made.
On page 12, West (1973) stated that 95 percent of the measurements of Apatemys specimens fall within one standard deviation of
the mean, and that this '' * * * confirms the conclusion that all may
be assigned to a single species.'' A recalculation shows that at least 95 percent of the measurements fall withm two standard deviations of the mean and that whereas this is consistent with a normal distribution, it does not specify normality nor does it say anything about the number of spectes contained in the distribution. It should
be noted that if it were true that 95 percent of the measurements occurred within one standard deviation, this would be a strong indication of non-normality (that is, a long-tailed distribution, with the specimen or specimens in the tail probably representing a second species). The distribution of Wasatchian M3 lengths in Apatemys (West, 1973, fig. 3) most closely approaches such a situation (82 percent fall Within one standard deviation), and it seems clear that the specimen that defines the tail, YPM 23476, represents a distinct
species. After performing t tests on the Wasatchian and Bridgerian
samples, West (1973, p. 13) concluded that at "* * * the 95 percent
or higher level of confidence both early and middle Eocene samples could be drawn from the same statistical population.'' In fact, no probability statement about the populations being the same is Justified by the t test All that can be said is that values of t as large as those obtained would occur at least x percent of the time (where x is determined by t and the degrees of freedom), if the populations were the same. West is correct in noting that the t test is a statement
about statistical populations and not about species (that is, two species could be present in both early and middle Eocene samples, but as long as there was no appreciable change in their means and variances, the t test would gtve the same result).
West (1973) addressed this last point on page 15 where, m discussing the range of variation of the Wasatchian and Bridgerian samples indiVIdually, he concluded that only one species is present at each sampled interval. For the Wasatchian sample (including two specimens from the late Tiffanian), West observed that although both small-size and large-size groups exist, the bimodality 1s not sufficient to warrant recognition of two species and that this conclusion is confirmed by t tests. West did not state if the tested groups were determined by a cntenon other than size (for example, number of P4 roots), but 1t must be assumed that they were, for 1t is mconcetvable that a distribution solely on the basis of size would not show a significant difference between the two resulting groups if the t test were

32 PROTEUTHERIA AND INSECTIVORA, WILLWOOD FORMATION, WYO
used. If one divides the Wasatchian sample in West's (1973) figure 2 at an M1 length of 2.0 mm (millimeters) and compares the resulting two groups using the t test, they are shown to be significantly different (t=6.37, n=18), with a probability of less than 0.001 that this difference is due to chance.
For the Bridgerian sample (including a few specimens from rocks of Uintan age), West (1973) observed only that there is less variation than in the Wasatchian sample, a fact he attributed to the smaller geograpluc and temporal range of this sample. However, a histogram of M2 lengths in the Bridgerian sample (fig. 16, tlus paper) shows that the sample separates into three groups. These groups correspond with the three earlier recognized Bridgerian species, A bellulus, A. bellus, and A. rodens, respectively. To test these two alternative schemes for grouping the samples, a chi-square test and a Bayesian analysis were employed. The only assumption made was that the underlying distributions are approximately normal. For West's (1973) one-species case, the null hypothesis is that the underlying distribution is a normal population with a single mean and standard deviation, as specified by the sample. For the three-species case, the null hypothesis is that there are three normally distributed populations, each having a mean and standard deviation specified by the sample, except for A rodens. The standard deviation for A. rodens was made equal to 0.12 and was determined by assuming that A rodens had a coefficient of variation equal to that of A. bellulus and A bellus. In the actual sample, A rodens has a standard deviation of zero. This figure is unrealistic and would bias the tests m favor of the three-species hypothesis.
The expected values for the chi-square test (equal to np,) were calculated in the followmg manner. For the one-species hypothesis, n equals 27, and for the three-species hypothesis, n equals 12, 13, or 2, depending on whether the cell is in the subdistribution specified by A. bellulus, A bellus, or A rodens, respectively The probability of being in the cell (p) is determined from the integral of the Gaussian function defmed by the parameters of the hypothesis, that is, the ith cell (where " equals a length of M2 in millimeters) actually represents the interval i±0.05. Tlus interval specifies an area under the defined normal curve, which, when normalized, equals the probability of being in the l-th cell (pJ The results are given in table 2. As can be seen from this table, the chi-square test could reject the one-species hypothesis at the 0.025level of significance, but the three-species hypothesis could not be reJected at the 0.70 level of significance. In other words, one would expect to see a deviation as great as that observed in the one-species hypothesis only 2.5 percent of the time, whereas one would expect to see it 70 percent of the time in the threespecies hypothesis.

One of the assumptions of the chi-square test, however, is that npi is greater than or equal to 5. This assumption- was not met in the analysis, but the data can be grouped (table 3) for the one-species hypothesis such that the expected value is greater than 5. The results are unchanged, and the one-species null hypothesis can still be rejected at the 0.025 level of significance. Because it is i!llpossible to group data for the three-species hypothesis in similar fashion without reducing the degrees of freedom to less than zero, the results of this test are inconclusive, but they are strongly suggestive that the sample contains three species and not only one.

The Bayesian analysis employs the ordinate values of the Gaussian function to determine the relative probability of two or more hypotheses. This method is described in Pilbeam and Vaisnys (1975). This analysis indicates that the three-species hypothesis is 40 times as likely as the one-species hypothesis, given equal a priori probabilities.
Because the three-species hypothesis is a priori the more likely on the basis of coefficients of variation (see next page), tlus test strengthens the original conclusion.
A third alternative is that A rodens is conspecific with A bellus and that only two species were present in the Bridgerian. The Bayesian analysis shows that this hypothesis is one-tlurd as hkely as the three-species hypothesis, a relatively inconclusive result.
A fourth alternative, proposed by Robinson (1966), 1s that the smallest species (A. bellulus) and the largest (A rodens) are conspecific. This suggestion was not considered because it is countermtuitive The union of these species was presumably proposed because of the single-rooted P4 held in common, but such a union produces a bimodal distribution. Because there is no independent eVIdence suggesting sexual dimorphism in apatemy1ds, tlus synonymy is unfounded. If sexual or size dimorphism were postulated for the A bellulus-A rodens union, it would be expected also in the remainder of the sample with a two-rooted P4, and it does not occur there.

One objection that can be raised concerning the preceding analyses is that the pooling of temporally and spatially disJunct samples might invalidate the assumption that the underlying population is normally distributed. The majority of specimens in the Bndgerian sample comes from a relatively restricted geographic area and temporal range in southwestern Wyoming, and the three type specimens from this area span nearly the entire range of size vanation. The two or three specimens from other areas (one is from the Huerfano formation of Colorado, and two are from rocks of Umtan age of California and Wyoming) were not removed from the analyses because it was not possible to distinguish them in West's (1973) scatter diagram. It is not beheved that their inclusion appreciably altered the analytical results because they do not represent end points in the siZe spectra.
West (1973, p. 13) pointed out that the coefficients of variation for his measurements are often greater than 10. In fact, all his coefficients of variation are greater than 10 and most are between 15 and 20. In a list of coefficients of variation for 19 mammalian species compiled by Gingerich (1974b), only two species show coefficients greater than 10, and these species are known to be sexually dimorphic (10.7 for M1W in Papw anubis, and 10.4 for M2L in Pongo pygmaeus). West observed that his coefficients of variation are high for single-
species populations but attributed it to the "* * * great range of temporal and geographic sources.'' He believed that ''* * * the co-
efficient of variation is therefore not considered as significant in the statistical interpretation of Apatemys as are the comparison of sample means.''
It has been seen earlier that a comparison of sample means tells us nothing about how many species are involved within a certain stratigraphic level if one is comparing means between different stratigraphic levels. Known ranges of variation translated into known ranges for coefficients of variation do have interpretive biological significance, and they are, therefore, considered by us to be more sigmficant. Furthermore, West (1973) observed that no significant change had taken place through time iri his samples, and nowhere has he demonstrated that populations from different geographic regions differ enough to result in the large coefficients of variation that occur when these samples are pooled. In the absence of this demonstration, it is neither justified nor convincing to assume that large coefficients of variation would result. For the Bridgerian sample of Apatemys studied by West, division into three species results in coefficients of variation that are between 4 and 5, well Within the range given for several mammals by Gingerich (1974b).
Studies of apatemyids are hampered by the small available

samples and a lack of good stratigraphic control for these samples. Lumping of samples from stratigraphically disparate localities by earlier workers has, doubtlessly, contributed equally to the problem, because this procedure tends to obfuscate, rather than clarify, complex patterns. As observed by Bown (1979), the pooling of tooth measurements for specimens from different stratigraphic levels in scatter diagrams, histograms, and the like probably gives us no reliable information concerning which and how many species occur in these samples. This lack of information is especially true if tooth sizes have changed significantly through time m the various lineages sampled. Earlier attempts to fit all the Apatemys morphologies into one or the other of McKenna's (1963) lineages creates additional problems because, from our study, there appear to be at least three lineages of Apatemys in the early Eocene. In figure 17, size measurements for M2 are plotted against time. The central Bighorn Basin Willwood Formation specimens were plotted according to their positions on a measured section (Schankler, 1980). The remaining specimens were located approximately by faunal comparisons.
As seen in figure 17, two species occur m the lower Gray Bull zone: Apatemys chardzm, and A kayz. A chardini is the smaller of the two and is characterized by a two-rooted P4• A. kayz is a larger, mediumsize species that is typified by a reduced, single-rooted P4• Both species exist in the Four Mile and No Water faunas and in the lower Gray Bull zone of the Clark's Fork and central Bighorn Basins. In the Powder River local fauna, only A. chardini is known; in the central Bighorn Basin, A. kayi does not occur higher than the middle Gray Bull zone; whereas A chardini appears to have given nse to A. bellulus (mcluding both A whitakeri and A. hurzeleri). The mediumsize Bridgerian species A. bellus first occurs in rocks of Lostcabmian age (Guthrie, 1971). Because A bellus shows variable conditions of the P4 roots, it does not seem to be a hkely descendant of A. kayz.
The fourth and largest lineage of Apatemys is represented by three specimens from the central Bighorn Basin. They are all from upper Gray Bull levels, near the boundary of the Gray Bull and Lysite zones, and the specimens are slightly larger than the type specrmen of Apatemys rodens. From A. rodens, they differ in several respects but are here believed to be its Wasatchian precursor.
Apatemys uzntenszs (as defined by West, 1973) probably contains both small and middle-size species, possibly the Uintan descendants of middle Eocene A bellulus and A. bellus, respectively.

Discusswn.-Apatemys chard"tm, is the most common and wide ranging of the Gray Bull zone apatemyids. As mentioned previously, it is known from localities of this age in other basins. The type specimen (PU 13236) is from either a middle or lower Gray Bull zone locality in the central Bighorn Basin. The only other specimens of A. chardznz from the Elk Creek section of the Willwood Formation occur in middle Gray Bull zone localities.
A chardini is the smallest species of Apatemys; the No Water, Powder River, and Four Mile specimens are slightly smaller than the Clark's Fork Basin or central Bighorn Basin specimens. The species differs from coeval A. kayi in the possession of a double-rooted P4 in the majority of specimens. UW 8908, from the No Water fauna, is an edentulous ramus that appears to have a single alveolus for P4• The specimen is tentatively referred to A chardzni because of its relatively small size. Because A. chardini is considered to be ancestral to A. bellulus, and assuming only one species is represented in the A chardinz sample, it is not unreasonable to expect a small proportion of the A. chardinz sample to have a single-rooted P4•
Referral of the small apatemyid from the Four Mile fauna to A. whitakeri (Delson, 1971) seems unwarranted. Delson recommended this name because of the similarity in size and morphology of the M2 between this specimen and the type of A whztakeri. McKenna (1960a), on the other hand, recorded the similarity between this specimen and the type specimen of A chardznz in the size and construction of M3• Because comparable elements are not preserved in the types (excluding P4, the tooth in which both types differ from each other) and because P4 is not known in the Four Mile specimen, there is no justification for assigning it to A whitaken.

D"tscusswn.-Apatemys bellulus was first described from Bridgerian rocks, but the species is here taken to include the late Wasatchian A whitakeri and A hurzeleri Simpson (1954) noted similarities shared by "Te"tlhardella wh"ttaken" and A. bellulus, but he referred his new species to Jepsen's (1930a) Te"tlhardella because of his reluctance to carry a Bridgerian genus into the Wasatchian. A comparison of the two types and other specimens referred to "T whitakeri" and A bellulus has revealed no characters that indicate that they are distinct. The other small late Wasatchian species, A. hurzeleri, does have relatively narrower molars than in A. bellulus, but, until other specimens are found with this character, Gazin's species is here considered to represent normal variation within A bellulus
Lysite and Lost Cabm zone A bellulus are intermediate in size between the smaller Graybullian A. chardin"t and the larger A bellulus specimens from Bridgerian rocks. Where this tooth is preserved, all known specimens of A bellulus possess a single-rooted P4; however, this is the only apatemyid now known from deposits of Lysitian age; it occurs in both the Willwood Formation of the central Bighorn Basin and in the Wind River Formation of the Wmd River Basin. In Lostcabinian time, it was more widespread (present in the Largo and La Barge faunas and in the type Lost Cabin Member of the Wind River Formation), and it is associated with A bellus in the type Lost Cabm Member (Guthrie, 1971).

Discusswn.-Apatemys kay, is the oldest known species of Apatemys. The type specrmen comes from the Clarkforlaan Bear Creek fauna of southern Montana A kayi persists into the Wasatchian, where it is known from the Four Mile, No Water, Clark's Fork Basin, and central Bighorn Basin faunas. In the Elk Creek section of the Willwood Formation, it is not known higher than the rmddle Gray Bull zone. Although this species agrees in size with Apatemys bellus, it is an unlikely ancestor for that taxon because it is doubtful that the trend for reduction of P4 was reversed. The P4 is single rooted m all specimens of A. kayi where it is preserved, whereas in A bellus the

40 PROTEUTHERIA AND INSECTIVORA, WILLWOOD FORMATION, WYO
condition of the P4 roots appears to be variable. It is also possible that A. kayi is ancestral to the much larger A rodens; however, there is currently no other evidence to suggest this relationship.

Discusswn.-Three very large specimens of Apatemys are known from the Willwood Formation of the central Bighorn Basin. The two YPM specimens are from localities on the eastern side of Red Butte, and the AMNH specimen is from north of Sheep Mountain. None of these localities are tied to measured sections, but other evidence (geographic and topographic positions and associated faunas) indicates a late Graybullian age, near the Graybullian-Lysitian faunal boundary. As demonstrated previously, there is considerable evidence on the basis of M2 size that A rodens is a valid species, distinct from its penecontemporaries A. bellus and A. bellulus. It is further distinguished by its very robust mandible and the relatively larger anterior incisor. A. rodens is also characterized by a single-rooted P4, a weak P4 fossa, and the presence of a single, large, double mental foramen. The referred specimens agree with the type of A rodens m size and in the single-rooted P4, although the alveolus for P4 in the referred specimens is larger than in the type. In the referred specimens, the two mental foramina are oblique to each other but are clearly distinct, and the size of the P4 fossa Is variable (moderate in YPM 23476, almost absent in YPM 30582). The enamel of the enlarged anterior tooth in the type specimen is confined to the ventral half of the crown, whereas in YPM 23476 the enamel is thin but not well delimited. In the type specimen, the paraconid of M3 IS more prominent and more lingually placed than in the referred specimens Also, the talonid of M3 is more elongate and the cusps are more distinct The basins of the talonids are deeper in the type, and a small ridge connects the entoconid and the hypoconid on M2• These differences indicate individual variation but are of doubtful taxonomic significance. The inclusion of the three referred specimens in A rodens extends the known range of this species into early Wasatchian time. The Uintan Apatemys downs1- may also be referable to A rodens; however, this possibility warrants separate investigation.

Family DORMAALDDAE1
Krishtalka (1976a) recently reviewed the North American early Tertiary so-called adap1soricid insectivores and concluded, as did Russell, Louis, and Savage (1975), that Adapisorex Lemoine (1883) (in Bown, 1979) could not naturally be grouped with the more typical of the so-called adapisoricids. Krishtalka recommended no solution to this abandoned family status, relegating Adap-,sorex to the Erinace1dae, yet continuing use of the name Adapisoricidae for mammals grouped by Quinet (1964) and by Russell, Louis, and Savage (1975) in the Dormaaliinae. We believe that Adap-,sorex and the dormaaliines are distinct at least at the family level, and we elevate the Dormaaliinae to family status. Adap-,sorex appears, m our opinion, to be closest structurally to the erinaceid-like condylarths Phenacodaptes and Apheliscus (Gazin, 1959), though some specimens of Adap-,sorex abundans (for example, Walbeck 390) are also similar in the lower dentition to Tiffanian B-,sonalueus Dormaal-,us IS an unfortunate type for this family, partly because of its strong similarity to Macrocranwn nltens (also noted by Russell and others, 1975) and partly because of the paucity of materials of Dormaal-,us. Both Macrocranion nltens and Dormaal-,us share several characters not found in other members of the family, and 1t may eventually become necessary to create a new subfamily to accomodate Scenopagus, Ankylodon, Talpauus, Talpaumdes gen. nov. (discussed later), and some of the new later Eocene forms described by Novacek (1976) from California.
Krishtalka (1976a) beheved the following insectivores to be valid North American so-called adapisoric1d genera:
Mckennathenum Van Valen, 1965 Scenopagus McKenna and Simpson, 1959 Ankylodon Patterson and McGrew, 1937 Macrocranion Weitzel, 1949 Talpauus Marsh, 1872. Mckennatherium ladae was believed by him to be the earliest as well as the most generalized member of the family, and an enigmatical form, "Diacodon" minutus Jepsen (1930b), was tentatively transferred to Adunator, a middle to late Paleocene European genus

42 PROTEUTHERIA AND INSECTIVORA, WILLWOOD FORMATION, WYO
(Russell, 1964). "D." ml.nutus and Adunator were then contrasted with some Paleocene hyopsodontids, with which they certainly share many derived characters. Because of the pivotal position that Mckennatherium (as "Leptacodon" ladae) has played in both recent and early evaluations of the origins of early insectivores and because its status as perceived by Krishtalka (1976a) relegates the genus to either real or supposed ple1siomorphy for Eocene dormaaliids, a critical examination of this genus is now necessary.
We have compared most of the best specimens relevant to this problem, including Mckennatherium (USNM 9640, type of Leptacodon ladae; AMNH 35437, type of Mckennatherium ll.bl.tum; AMNH 35954, 35955; PU 17722), and "Dl.acodon" minutus (PU 13360, 13360a, 13304, types; PU 19395) with the type specimen of Adunator lehmani (Walbeck 368) and conclude, as did Krishtalka, that lower teeth of "D." minutus and Adunator are virtually identical. Krishtalka (1976a) also recorded similarities of "D" minutus to Mckennatherium but chose to retain these forms as distinct genera; in his view, the latter genus is the earliest of the so-called adapisoricids, and the former genus is probably a hyopsodontid condylarth. We believe that Mckennatherium ladae and "Dl.acodon" ml.nutus are very closely related, and that both probably represent North American species of Adunator.
Krishtalka (1976a, p. 10) believed that the following are attributes of Adunator and "Diacodon" minutus that are not shared by Mckennatherium:
1. The talonids of M1_2 are shghtly elongate.
2. M2 is larger than M1. 3. The paraconid on M2 is extremely
compressed and is merged with the anterior part of the metaconid. 4. The metaconid is greatly expanded antenorly in lingual view so that it is much larger and more bulbous than is the protoconid. 5. P.. has a well-developed paraconid that is as high (tall) as the metaconid 6. The paraconid is strong on P3 in "D." ml.nutus but is absent in Mckennatherium.
These alleged differences led Krishtalka (1976a, p. 10) to remark: "These exceptions to adapisoricid affinities in the lower molars of

ORDER INSECTIVORA

43

Adunator-"D." mznutus are features associated with some Tiffanian hyopsodontid condylarths like Haplaletes."
With respect to these differences noted by Krishtalka, we have ob-
served that:
1 The talonids of M1_2 in Adunator lehman., and "DULCodon" mlnutus are not perceptibly longer than in Mckennathenum.
2. M2 is about the same size as M1 m the type of Adunator lehmanz (both are approximately 1.7 mm long), as also in Mckennathenum (Krishtalka, 1976a, table 1).
3. The M2 paraconid IS also compressed and is closely appressed to the metaconid in Mckennathenum.
4 The M1_3 metaconids are also large and anteriorly expanded in Mckennathenum.
5. The P4 paraconid is shorter (less tall) than the metaconid in Adunator, "Diacodon" mznutus, and Mckennatherium but does arise at a lower pomt on the paracnstid m the last genus.
6. The P3 paraconid appears to be absent in some M ladae (for example, PU 17722; this cusp may have been broken off-only a cast of this specimen was examined by us); a strong paraconid 1s, however, present on P3 in at least some Mckennatherium (for example, AMNH 35954, Krishtalka, 1976a, fig. 2A).

In our oprmon, materials of Adunator, Mckennathenum, and ''Diacodon" minutus are nearly inseparable on the six above criteria,
and what slight differences do exist do not argue convincingly for generic distinction Upper molars referred to Adunator and to "Diacodon" minutus are more distinct (as Krishtalka recognized); however, in both, their association with the lower teeth is uncertain.
Mckennathenum is known from lower jaws preserving, in composite, P2-M3, "DULCodon" mznutus is known from nearly the entire

44 PROTEUTHERIA AND INSECTIVORA, WILLWOOD FORMATION, WYO
lower dentition, and Adunator 1s known from P2-M3• The comparable parts of these lower dentitions are so similar, even in several trivial respects, that these animals were almost certainly closely related. The dental evidence does not indicate that they are dentally convergent homeomorphs, because there is no good morphologic basis for separation at the generic level. Fairly well established convergent similarities between other groups of well-known early mammals (for example, molars of plesiadapid and notharctine primates) rarely, if ever, pervade both the premolar and molar teeth, and a complex of crossing specialized characters allows the reliable identification of even isolated teeth.
The systematic positions of Adunator and its probable North American allies "Diacodon" mlnutus and Mckennathenum ladae remain in doubt, however, none are dormaaliids. The removal of the last two species leaves this family without any certain described Paleocene representatives but unifies Eocene forms in a more cohesive morphologic group. Even so, the Eocene dormaaliids may not make up a natural grouping. Macrocranion, in particular, deviates from Scenopagus, Talpavus, Talpavmdes, and Ankylodon in several erinaceid features, some of which it shares with Dormaalius. In Macrocranion, these characters include the reduction in size of P1_3, the relatively large size of P.. with respect toM., relatively low molar trigonids, broad molar talonids, relatively tall entoconids, and relatively short (flat) hypoconids.
Macrocranwn nitens has a close morphologic counterpart in late Paleocene Litolestes and differs from that genus principally m having somewhat more shelflike molar paraconids, relatively broader molar talonids, a less compressed M2 trigonid, and in the greater exaggeration of the tall, lingually deflected molar entoconids. Ps is variable in Litolestes In AMNH 33936, it-is nearly as tall asP.., but in PU 19387 (L. ignotus) it is short and reduced relative to P4• P3 in Macrocranwn is, invariably, greatly reduced relative to P4• The molars typically decrease in size posteriorly in Litolestes, whereas they are more nearly equal in s1ze m Macrocranwn. None of these characters, however, constitute insurmountable obstacles to the possible familial association of these genera, particularly when one considers our rudimentary knowledge of what are generalized and what are derived characters in early erinaceids. From a cladistic rather than a phylogenetic viewpoint, the association of Litolestes and Macrocranion is, to us, even more apparent.
An evaluation of the many similarities shared by early erinaceids and certain condylarths is beyond the scope of this paper, and, in itself, warrants a general review.
Perhaps of auxiliary importance to the early history of the dormaaliids is PU 18688, a right P3-M2 of dormaaliid-like mammal from the

ORDER INSECTIVORA

Torrejonian Rock Bench quarry of the Fort Union Formation (Polecat Bench Formation of Jepsen, 1940). This specimen is now on loan from the Princeton University collections and will, presumably, be described by other workers. However, the teeth appear to be sufficiently generalized to be of potential importance to the origins of the dormaaliids, geolabidids, or both.

Discusswn.-As mentioned previously, placement of Macrocranion and Dormaalius in the same subfamily as Scenopagus, Talpavus, Talpavmdes, gen. nov. (p. 50), and Ankylodon may not adequately reflect the morphologic disparity between these two groups. The former two genera may even be erinaceids, and their inclusion in the same family as the other four genera is tentative
Krishtalka (1976a) transferred Matthew's (1918) Entomolestes nztens to Macrocranwn Weitzel (1949), a relationship that was hinted at but not fully endorsed by Russell, Lows, and Savage (1975). The species nitens is certainly more aptly placed in Macrocranwn than in
Entomolestes, but Krishtalka's (1976a) belief that nztens "* * * IS virtually identical to Macrocranwn tenerum (=Messelzna) * * *"
does not seem compelling to us after we compared a large number of casts, illustrations, and descnptions. What differences do exist, however, seem to be more significant at the specific rather than at the generic level, and we hesitantly accept the synonymy of Entomolestes nitens with Macrocranwn.
Russell, Louis, and Savage (1975) allocated numerous teeth from the French early Eocene to Entomolestes cf. nztens. Casts of the several specimens of French E. cf. nztens available to us are also provisionally referable to Macrocranwn, but we agree with Russell, Louis, and Savage (1975) that the identity of some of this sample is questionable, principally because of the large amount of variation in P4 and the upper molars. In several respects, the French sample resembles specimens of M nztens from the San Jose Formation of New Mexico more than those from the Willwood or Wind River Formations.
Willwood Macrocranwn nztens conforms well with the type of the species (also from the Willwood) and with most specimens from the Four Mile fauna (Graybullian) and the Lysite and Lost Cabin

46 PROTEUTHERIAAND INSECTIVORA, WILLWOOD FORMATION, WYO
Members of the Wind River Formation. The Almagre and other San Jose Formation specimens, however, show a number of consistent differences that suggest that they may belong to a separate species. The upper molars in AMNH 48177 (from the San Jose Formation) are relatively shorter and less squared, and they appear to have more acute cusps than in either of two upper dentitions from the Willwood Formation (YPM 23077 and 30655). Moreover, the Willwood specimens possess an M1 that is larger than M2, a relatively smaller M1 mesostyle, a straighter, less V-shaped M2 ectoflexus, and relatively shorter M1- 2 preprotocrista and postprotocrista.
In the lower dentition, P4 in Willwood M nitens generally has a less well basined talonid than in San Jose or Almagre specimens, though this feature is somewhat variable. This talonid construction is essentially the same as that seen in UCMP 44106 (McKenna, 1960a, fig. 25) from the Four Mile fauna, and TTU-P 4211 from the Lysite Member of the Wind River Formation.
YPM 30655 (pl. 5, figs. 3, 4; pl. 6, fig. 1) is an associated left P:-M~ (prepared from occlusion) that differs from typical Willwood, Wind River, and Four Mile M nztens in the greatly reduced, nearly absent, P4 metaconid. The heel of P4 is short and unbasined (no cristid obliqua) as in the type of the species, TTU-P 4211, AMNH 48174, and most of the other Willwood specimens, and the faint metaconid is probably an individual aberration.
Teeth of Macrocranion nztens from low in the Willwood section (for example, YPM 30651, 30553, 30597; at the 145-, 180-, and 240-m levels) are smaller than teeth from higher stratigraphic levels (for example, YPM 23087,27941, 23077; at the 560-,590-, and 620-m levels). Measurements are given in table 4.
In the Willwood Formation of the central Bighorn Basin, M nitens is known from the uppermost part of the lower Gray Bull zone to the upper part of the Lysite zone (fig. 18). In the No Water Creek area (Bown, 1979), the species occurs at localities between the 30- and 120-m levels; all are early Graybullian in age. The stratigraphic position of the type specimen is uncertain, but it is probably from the middle or upper Gray Bull zones.

ther comparisons convince us that this specimen represents a new, relatively generalized species of Scenopagus. Referral of the remainder of the proposed hyopdigm IS only tentative (especially for the upper teeth) and must be confirmed by the recovery of more com-

plete materials and associated upper and lower teeth. The distinctive
characters of P4 in the type specimen of S hewettensis are probably generalized with respect to Bridgerian species.
Krishtalka (1976a) recognized Scenopagus curndens as the thenonly-known Wasatchian species of Scenopagus S hewettens~s differs from S. curndens in Its much larger siZe and more molarized P4• The only known P4 of S. curtidens (Bown, 1981) is premolariform and differs from that in a tentatively referred upper tooth of S hewettens~s in the absence of a metacone. Referred specimens of S hewettensis are known only from the early Graybullian Banjo quarry (70-m level,
Sand Creek facies). Measurements.-Type specimen (mm): P..L=1.70, P..W=1.06,
M1L=2.00, MtWTn=1.35, MtWTal=1.45.

Scenopagus sp.
Referred spec~mens.-YPM 26796, 30614, UW 9595, 9611, 9638 (Bown, 1979, fig. 42c), 9662, 9695, 9699, 9713, 9720, 9729, 10422.
D~scusswn.-This sample contains at least two species of Scenopagus, at least one of which is probably new; however, the material is not adequate to name them or to confidently assign them to known species. Two specimens of semimolariform P" belong to one of these species, and one of these (UW 9638) is associated with a ps and an M2 of unequivocal Scenopagus morphology. Bown (1979) referred UW 9638, among others, to cf. Scenopagus sp., probably new, and it is now relatively certam that P4 (m S hewettensis) and P4 were semimolariform in at least some early Wasatchian species of Scenopagus, m contrast to all known Bridgerian species
The molars closely resemble their size counterparts in Scenopagus edenens~s (for example, YPM 26796), S curtidens (for example, YPM 30614), and S pnscus (for example, UW 9695) S edenens~s and S pnscus are elsewhere known only from rocks of late Wasatchian and Bridgerian age. However, Krishtalka (1976a) has reported S curndens from the early Wasatchian Four Mile fauna It is unlikely that any of these species are represented in the sample from the Willwood Formation.
Scenopagus sp. is thus far known only from one locality in the central Bighorn Basin Elk Creek section, where it occurs in the lowest sampled level of the middle Gray Bull zone (200-m level). In the Sand Creek facies, Scenopagus sp. is known from eight localities, six of which occur between the 30- and 81-m levels; the other two sites are of uncertain stratigraphic position. The Sand Creek localities yield an early Graybullian fauna

Etymology.-Greek i?ides; like, having the form of; in allusion to

superficial similarities to Talpauus.

Type.-Talpauoides dartoni, sp. nov., and only known speCies.

Diagnosis."P4 smaller with respect to M1 than in Scenopagus,
Macrocranion, or Plagioctenodon but semimolariform iD contrast to

former two genera and Talpauus. P4 talonid basin weak and with poorly formed cristid obliqua in contrast to Plagioctenodon, but both
structures more strongly developed than in Talpauus. M1>M2>M3
in contrast to all above genera, and M1_2 entoconids tall, acute, and slightly displaced lingually. Molar cristids obliqua join base of

metaconid lingually, and molar entoconids situated at posterolingual

talonid margins as in Plagioctenodon, not more anteriorly as in most

other nyctitheriids.

Hypodigm.-The type and UW 6974,6999,7005,8586,8993,9000, 9597 (pl. 6, fig. 3), 9600, 9610, 9613, 9618, 9623, 9635, 9666, 9674,

30643, 31168. Dwgnoszs.-Only known species, same as for genus. Dzscusswn -The more premolariform P4 (particularly the talorud
reduction), the reduction of P4 relative to M1 m s1ze, the progressive size decrease of the molars from M1 to M3, and the position of the molar entoconids indicate placement of this form m the Erinaceo-
morpha. Though the M1_3 size ratio is reminiscent of that in the erinaceids, the remainder of the morphology supports inclusiOn of
Talpavoides in the Dormaaliidae. From Bridgerian and Wasatchian Talpavus, Talpavozdes IS dis-
tinguished by its better developed P4 talonid basm, Its shorter P4 metaconid (the P4 metacorud and protocorud are equal in height in Talpavus nztulus), and by the M1 through M3 size ratio The cristid obliqua of M1_2 Is also more acute in Talpavoides, and the molars, correspondingly, appear to be more exodaenodont than in Talpavus
Krishtalka (1976a) referred several specimens from the Huerfano,
Green River, and lower Willwood Formations to Talpavus cf. nztulus The Willwood specimens (for example, CM 31180) differ from Talpavoules in most Talpavus-like features, including the taller P4 metacorud, a less well defined heel on P4, a shghtly more compressed M2 trigonid, and the lack of a well-defined molar size gradient. The former three of these characters are probably derived With respect to the teeth in Talpavoides, and the last character is probably generalized
Talpavoides is the most suitable of the generahzed dormaaliids for
possible Inclusion in the ancestry of Talpavus Selection favoring the relative increase in siZe of M2 relative to M1 or decrease in size of M1 relative to M2, coupled with further reduction of the P4 talonid and increase in relative size of the P4 metaconid, would be required to derive Talpavus nztidus directly from a population of Talpavozdes dartonz. Considerable premolarization of P4 must have taken place at some point in the lineages of Scenopagus, Macrocranion, and Talpavus if PU 18688 (seep. 44) had anything to do w1th the later Wasatchian and Bridgerian radiation of dormaaliids. As indicated above for Scenopagus hewettenszs and Scenopagus sp., P: premolarization was a characteristic trend in the lineages of that genus.
From Macrocranion, Talpavozdes differs in its much smaller siZe,
its relatively narrower P4, taller trigoruds and taller, more acute molar cusps, greater exodaenodonty of the molars, and the molar-size
gradient. The taller molar entoconids and sharper cusps are probably generalized features relative to Macrocranwn, whereas the exo-

52 PROTEUTHERIA AND INSECTIVORA, WILLWOOD FORMATION, WYO
daenodonty and posteriorly smaller molars are specializations that preclude this genus from a close relationship to Macrocranlon.
Talpavoides dartonl is known from only two localities m the Elk Creek section of the Willwood Formation, where it occurs in the lower Gray Bull zone at the 140- and 180-m levels. In the Sand Creek facies, this taxon is found at 15 localities between the 24- and 180-m levels. The 180-m level m the Sand Creek facies is the lowest occurrence of the adapid primate Pelycodus tngonodus in these rocks (Bown, 1979), whereas this animal first appears at the level of locahty 355 (240-m level) in the Elk Creek section T dartonl, therefore, occurs in the lower Gray Bull zone of the Elk Creek section, but in the lower Gray Bull through the lowest part of the middle Gray Bull zones in the Sand Creek facies.

Referred specimens.-UW 7048, 9627 (pl. 6, fig. 5). Diagnostic characters.-Molars strongly exodaenodont, more so than in Scenopagus, Talpavus, or Macrocranwn. M2_3 trigonids strongly compressed anteroposteriorly, and metaconid and entocorud markedly taller than protoconid and hypoconid, respectively. Hypoconulids large, close to entoconids. Entoconids trenchant and deflected lingually and talonid notch acute. Ms relatively unreduced in comparison to M2. Dlscussion.-This species is known from only two complete teeth, but the characters cited previously appear to be diagnostic. The trigonid structure is remiiliscent of that in Talpavus; however, the talonids are wholly dissimilar. Macrocranwn, conversely, has tall, lingual entoconids and large, somewhat lingual hypoconulids, but molars of M nitens are less exodaenodont and have less trenchant cusps and less compressed trigonids. Better material is needed to meaningfully assess the relations and significance of this animal. Dormaaliid sp. A is known only from the early Graybullian Sand Creek facies of the Willwood Formation, where it occurs at two localities at the 30- and 46-m levels. Measurements.-(mm): UW 7048: M2L=1.20, M2W=0.95.

M1 larger than M2 in contrast to many dormaaliids, and molars more exodaenodont than in Lztolestes, Leipsanolestes, Macrocranion, or Talpavus.

Hypodigm -The type and YPM 35156 (pl. 6, fig. 6; pl. 7, fig. 1). Diagnosis.-Only known species; same as for genus. Measurements.-(mm): UW 9616 (type): P4L=1.18, P4W=0.81, M1L=1.43, M1W=O 97, M2L=1.19, M2W=0.91. YPM 35156: P 4L=1.30, P 4W=0.80, M1L=1.55, M1W=l.OO, M2L=1.38, M2W=l.OO. Dzscusswn.-Bown (1979) placed the type of Eolestes in Lezpsanolestes, the closest morphologic counterpart of the new genus. Restudy of the type specimen and YPM 35156 and comparisons with new and better materials of Leipsanolestes szegfnedn and Entomolestes grangen (Krishtalka, 1976a; Krishtalka and West, 1977) convince us that both Willwood specimens represent a new genus of erinaceid but one that is most closely related to these two mammals. Eolestes is retained in the Erinace1dae on the basis of (1) premolar construction, (2) the more cuspidate paraconid on M1 than on M2, (3) the rectangular molars, (4) the high molar entocnstids, (5) M1 larger than M2, and (6) very flat hypoconids. In contrast to Leipsanolestes siegfriedti, the molars are strongly exodaenodont, the hypoflexid is deep, the P4 talonid is more reduced, the molar entocristids are taller, the paraconids are more cuspidate, and the cristids are more oblique and are connected to the metaconid. All these features, except the more cuspidate paraconids, are characters that are probably derived relative to the condition m Leipsanolestes, and all, with the exception of the connection of the cristid obhqua and metaconid, parallel the developments in Entomolestes grangeri. From Entomolestes, Eolestes is distinguished by the last feature, its larger P4 with respect to M19 its less oblique (more anteroposterior)

ORDER INSECTIVORA

55

alinement of the P4 prevallid (because the paraconid is more anteriorly removed from the metaconid), the less well developed M2 entocristid, and the deeper hypoflexids. The relative size of the P4 and the molar entocnstid development in Eolestes are probably generalized with respect to Entomolestes, and the P4 trigonid construction (similar to that in Leipsanolestes) may also be generalized for some early Tertiary erinaceids. The cristid obliqua-metaconid confluence and the resultant deep hypoflexid is unique among the early Tertiary erinaceids and is convergent to some extent With the conc:htion m some talpids (for example, the Desmaninae). This feature is doubtlessly derived with respect to both Leipsanolestes and Entomolestes and suggests that Eolestes is removed from the ancestry of the latter
genus.

cf. Leipsanolestes sp.
Referred spec~men.-UW 9672, a left M3 Discussion.-This tooth is related to Leipsanolestes and the erinaceids m the possession of bulbous cusps in conJunction with a short trigonid, by a shallow hypoflexid, by a strongly developed paraconid shelf without a cuspidate paraconid, by a low, flat hypoconid and taller entoconid, and by its general exodaenodont configuration. The tooth is distinguished from that in Le~psanolestes seigfriedti by its 15-percent larger size, a less lingually deflected metaconid, a relatively deeper talonid basin, and a less anteriorly attenuated paraconid shelf. The tooth is less similar to M3 m L~tolestes and does not closely resemble molars of Eolestes, "Leptacodon" Jepsen~, or Entomolestes grangen. It is possible that the specimen represents a large, undescribed species of Letpsanolestes that was approXImately coeval with Willwood L siegfnedh; however, the material is inadequate to positively ascertain its affinities within the Erinaceidae. Cf. Le~psanolestes sp. is known from only one locality, at the 88-m level of the Sand Creek facies where the only specimen was found in association with an early Graybullian fauna Measurements -(mm): M3L=l.75, M3W=l 20.

Dzscusswn.-This specimen appears to be a large variant of McKenna's (1960a) "Leptacodon" Jepsenz, from which It is nearly inseparable on morphologic grounds (YPM 30559 IS larger) M1 in the Yale specimen has a slightly more anteroposteriorly compressed trigonid than occurs in the type of "L "jepsenz.
"Leptacodon" Jepsenz was established on the type lower Jaw with P2-M2 and two other damaged teeth from the Four Mile Creek area of northwestern Colorado. Delson (1971) referred four additional specimens to this enigmatical species and believed that it is probably more closely related to his concept of the adapisoricids than to Leptacodon. This conclusion was later endorsed by Krishtalka (1976a), who did not comment further on its affinities.
Of Delson's referred matenals, only AMNH 56313 (an M3) is probably referable to "L " Jepsen" AMNH 56311 and 56312 are nyctitheriids and closely resemble Leptacodon tener and small specimens of Plagioctenodon krausae M3 is not preserved in the type of ''L '' Jepsenz, and the reference of AMNH 56313 to that taxon is provisional and is based on its having a lingual hypoconulid that is not expanded posteriorly as in Entomolestes grangeri.
AMNH 56314 and 56315, also from the Powder River local fauna and With labels bearing "Leptacodon", most closely resemble Plagwctenodon savagez, sp. nov. (seep. 61), differing from it only in the following trivial respects: (1) the teeth are slightly larger, (2) the P4 talonid is relatively longer and somewhat more squared, (3) the molar talonids are more roundly basined, and (4) M1 has a more continuous entocristid. The M1 trigonid is not preserved in the type of Plagwctendon savage1, however, m P krausae the trigonid is more anteroposteriorly compressed than it is in AMNH 56314.
We agree with Delson's (1971) suggestion that "L "jepsenz is in or near the ancestry of Bridgenan Entomolestes grangeri McKenna (1960a, p. 53) also observed that "Leptacodon" jepsenz is "Entomolestes-like." P4 is the most diagnostic tooth in both species and IS typified by a very large, anteriorly proJecting paraconid that arises very high on the face of the trigonid, m conjunction with a short, poorly basined talomd (pl. 7, fig. 5). The molars of "L "Jepsenz differ from those of E grangeri in size (type materials of "L "jepsenz are smaller), in having a smaller P3 to P4 size ratio, in the shorter, more curved prevallid, in the slightly larger and more linguolabially compressed entocristids in Entomolestes, and in the somewhat more exodaenodont configuration of the molars in the last genus.
"L "jepsenz differs from Eolestes in (1) a smaller P4 with respect to M17 (2) the better developed talomd basin in "L "Jepsenz, (3) the more poorly developed molar entocristids, (4) the lack of connection of the cnstid obliqua to the metaconid, and (5) the presence of a more acute paracnstid notch m "L." jepsenz. These observations support our

contention that "Leptacodon" jepsem, is morphologically closer to Entomolestes grangen than to either Eolestes or Lezpsanolestes
Krishtalka and West (1977) described additional specimens of Entomolestes grangen (for 68 years, the type was the only published specrmen), and to the hypodigm we add AMNH 98742 (pl. 7, figs. 2, 4) from rocks of late Bridgerian age near Tabernacle Butte. This specimen (identified by James Honey) preserves Pr M3, and, aside from the type, is the most complete undamaged lower dentition. Interestingly, the highly distinctive P4 construction of both "L "jepseni and E. grangeri exists (in modified form) in AquitanianAmphechinus, living Erinaceus, and several other advanced ennaceines (see, for example, figures in Rich and Rich, 1971; Rich and Rasmussen, 1973).

Order INSECTIVORA Suborder SORICOMORPHA Famlly NYCTITHERIIDAE

In his review of the early Tertiary nyctitheriids of North Amenca,

Krishtalka (1975, 1976b) considered the following characters to be

diagnostic of the family: (1) the presence of a vesp1form constriction

between the molar trigomds and talonids, (2) presence of a

semimolariform P4 with a low paraconid projecting out from the anterior part of the base of the protoconid, (3) relatively high (tall)

molar hypoconids that did not become flat with wear, (4) unreduced

molar hypoconulids, and (5) deep molar hypoflexids. In contrast, the

sensu lato adapisoricids (dormaaliids of this report) were believed to

be charactenzed by (1) progressive tangular molars with low, relatively

premolarization bunodont cusps,

and lower hypoconid, (5) median, or barely lingual and unreduced

molar hypoconulids, and (6) a shallow hypoflexid with the cristid obli-

qua meeting the postvallid labial to the protocristid notch. In Ius

discussion of "Leptacodon" jepseni, Krishtalka (1976b, p 17) also m-

ferred that the position of the P4 paraconid high on the anterior face

of the trigonid was a more typical adapisoricid (sensu Krishtalka)

than nyctitheriid character. From our comparisons of-early Tertiary

dormaaliids, erinaceids, and nyctitheriids, we offer the following sup-

plementary notes and qualifications.

First, the P4 paraconid is relatively as large and arises equally low on the tngonid in Mckennathenum (Adapisoricidae, according to

Krishtalka, 1976a; for example, AMNH 35955, PU 17722) as it does

58 PROTEUTHERIA AND INSECTIVORA, WILLWOOD FORMATION, WYO
in any species of Leptacodon or Nycnthenum If Mckennatherium is to be retained m the Dormaaliidae (the diminished probability of this association is discussed on p. 42-44), the relative height of the P4 paraconid is of little diagnostic value. Indeed, the position of this cusp on P4 in at least some "Leptacodon" munusculum (for example, PU 20026), Nycnthenum velox (for example, YPM 14936), N. seronnum (for example, CM 13722), and Pontifactor (for example, AMNH 15103) is much higher on the trigonid than it is in Mckennatherium and most closely resembles the positions in the dormaallids Talpavus and Macrocranion.
Second, other than the deep hypoflexid, we see no particularly overt vespiform constriction between the molar trigonids and talonids in "Leptacodon" munusculum, "Leptacodon" packz, or Nyctithenum velox. Among known nyctitheriids, tlus character is perhaps best developed in Ponnfactor; however, no nyctitheriid has this constriction so explicitly developed as m Macrocranwn or dormaallid sp. A. (p. 52). This constriction owes its visual properties to a deep hypoflexid in combination with a lingual leaning of the entoconid. We do not believe that the degree of constriction of the talonidtrigonid juncture is particularly diagnostic for nyctitheriids when compared to its development in both dormaaliid~ and erinaceids.
Third, the relatively high hypoconids considered to be a diagnostic feature of trhe nyctitheriids by Krishtalka are more evident 1n Pontifactor and some Nycnthenum than they are in Leptacodon. In some instances, this feature results not from unusually tall hypoconids but from relatively short entoconids. Moreover, in all the forms believed to be nyctitheriids by Krishtalka (1976b), excluding Satuminia beata and Leptacodon tener, the entoconids are both relatively low and are situated slightly more anteriorly than in adapisoricids. This appears to be a significant shared and derived character uniting "Leptacodon" munusculum and at least some "Leptacodon" packz with Pontifactor and middle Eocene nyctitheriids. In "L "packi and in at least some specimens of "L" munusculum (for example, PU 20026), Ponnfactor sp. (see p. 59), Nycnthenum velox, and N seronnum, the entoconid is also somewhat linguolabially compressed and is connected to the base of the metaconid by a minor entocristid. The development of the entocristid is greater than m any of the dormaaliids and is convergent with that in some erinaceids and in some of the distant nyctitheriid relatives-the shrews.
These differences suggest the division of the Nyctitheriidae into two groups: one containing Leptacodon tener, Plagioctenodon, Plagwctenoides, and Satuminia beata; the other with "Leptacodon" munusculum, "Leptacodon" packz, Saturninza gracilzs, Amphzdozotherium, Pontifactor, and Nyctitherium. A complex of apparent crossing characters, however, masks the significance of these

shared attributes and indicates that these do not constitute two natural phylogenetic groups.
Krishtalka (1976b) observed that "Leptacodon" munusculum might belong in Pontifactor and that "L." pack~ llllght more aptly be
placed in Nyctitheriu m This concept independently recognizes the morphologic discrepancies between Leptacodon tener and other species referred to this genus; however, we do not recommend these
synonymies. "Leptacodon" pack~ Jepsen (1930b) further differs from more
typical nyctithenids in the extremely tall and trenchant P3_4, and in having a conspicuous labioinferior depression of the enamel beneath
the P4 hypoflexid, and differs from Nyctitherium in having the molar trigonids relatively long with respect to the talonids. P3_4 are reminis· cent of the general morphology of those teeth in early geolabidids,
such as Centetodon patratus, sp. nov. (p. 64), or C pulcher The
molars of early Centetodon, however, do not particularly resemble those of "L" packi, but the premolar similarities suggest that the
latter species may have had a more generalized, central position in
the ancestry of early Tertiary soricoids, rather than a more special·
ized position as a possible synonym of Nyctitherium.

Bown (1979) referred additional upper cheek teeth to this animal, under the designation Ponnfactor cf. bestiola. 'I'he four additional undescribed specimens at hand (from the original hypodigm of Plagioctenodon krausae, see Bown, 1979) are smaller but otherwise closely resemble molars in AMNH 15103 and are here referred to Ponnfactor sp.
In contrast to both Plagioctenodon and Talpavoides, these lower molars possess acute, deep talonid basins, a deep hypoflexid, more trenchant cusps, and unreduced hypoconulids, characters that Krishtalka (1976b) cited as diagnostic of nyctitheriids. The molars (only M1_2 are represented) have the anteroposteriorly compressed trigonids, lophid·like and anterolingually flaring paraconids, a large medial hypoconulid, and a tiny mesoconid, all typical of Krishtalka's Pontifactor sp. Other than the presence of an eruptive M3, we are unable to ascertain by which criteria both Matthew (1918) and Krishtalka (1976b) presumed that P4 in AMNH 15103 is deciduous. The tooth is broken between the trigonid and talonid, and the talonid

COMMENTS ON PLAGIOCTENODON BOWN, 1979
Bown (1979) erected the genus Plagioctenodon for approximately 40 lower jaws and several individual teeth in the No Water collection from the Sand Creek facies of the Willwood Formation. Owmg to the current resurgence of interest in early Eocene faunas in general and early Eocene insectivores in particular, many useful comparative materials were not available for study at the time of the original description of the No Water msectivores, and those observations were based principally on comparisons of pubhshed figures, text descriptions, and a few casts. Bown (1979) recognized the large amount of morphologic variation in the sample referred to Plagwctenodon and named only the last genus for the most distinctive specimens. Virtually all of the best of the recently published specimens of Paleocene and early Eocene insectivores have now been examined and compared with specimens in the original hypodigm of Plagwctenodon, and it is now possible to give a more comprehensive account of the several mammals originally included in the latter genus.
Bown (1979) believed Plagioctenodon to be an early adapisoricid (sensu lato), perhaps most closely allied to the enigmatical "Leptacodon'' jepseni but with several crossing specializations that are reminiscent of both early adapisoricids and early nyctitheriids. These conclusions are fundamentally changed by this study; "Leptacodon" jepsem, is an erinaceid mostly closely related to Entomolestes grangen (p. 56), Plagwctenodon (sensu stricto) is a nyctitheriid, and the origmal hypodigms ascribed to Plagioctenodon krausae and P cf. krausae contain representatives of five species. Four of these (Scenopagus sp., Talpavouies dartonz, dormaaliid sp. A., and some specimens of Pontifactor sp.) have already been discussed.

Emended diagnosls.-P2_3 anteriorly inclined. P2 larger than P3, and no diastema separates these teeth. P4 semimolariform, elongated anteroposteriorly, narrow transversely, with paraconid large and
anteriorly projecting, and arising higher on the anterior face of the trigonid than in Leptacodon. P4 talonid with two or three well-defined cusps and well-developed basin. P4 relatively larger with respect to M1 than in Talpavoides. M1 and M2 about equal in size; M3 slightly smaller than M2. M1_2 entoconids significantly taller than hypoconids; entoconids do not project lingually and are situated at
posterolingual margms of molars, not more anteriorly as in some Lep-
tacodon and all Nyctltherium. No vespiform constriction between trigonid and talonid of molars.
Dlscussion.-Plagioctenodon krausae appears to share some of the
characters discussed above with dormaaliids, as suggested by Bown
(1979). Particularly relevant here are the shallow molar hypoflexids, tall, posterolingual molar entoconids, open talonid notch, and
relatively minor molar hypoconulids. It appears to us more likely,
however, that Plagioctenodon is a derivative of Paleocene Leptacodon tener. The P2_3 constructiOn, P4 molarizatlon, less compressed M1_2 trigonids, broader molar talonids, and acute molar cusps (especially the metaconid) argue for close affinity to L tener and the
earliest nyctitheriids. L. tener, Plagioctenodon, Plagwctenoides mlcrolestes (p. 64), and Satuminia beata differ from "L."

Discussion.-The type specimen of P. savagei, with the exception of. its much larger size, is virtually identical to the specimens previously referred in this report to Plagioctenodon . krausae. Plagioctenodon does not closely resemble Scenopagus and the more derived dormaaliids or any erinaceid; and, as observed previously, it is probably most closely related to the Leptacodon tener group of nyctitheriids. To clarify the varying degrees of semblance of P. savagei to earlier described nyctitheriids, the results of our comparisons are abstracted on the following page.

64 PROTEUTHERIA AND INSECTIVORA, WILLWOOD FORMATION, WYO
Plagwctenodon savagei is a possible derivative of P krausae. However, the stratigraphic evidence suggests that these two species may have been contemporanes even though they share no localities in common. Plagioctenodon is closest to Leptacodon tener among known nyctitheriids, as evidenced by the posterior molar entoconids. The less cuspidate M1_3 paraconids and the position of the P4 paraconid are almost certainly derived characters, relative to L. tener
Cf. Leptacodon of Krishtalka (1976b, p. 16) may belong in P savage,, but the referred specimens from the Sand Wash Basin of Colorado are somewhat larger. At any rate, M1_2 in that species appear to have relatively shallow hypoflexids, a highly molarized P4, and posteriorly situated entoconids (Krishtalka, 1976b, fig. 4).
Measurements.-Type of P. savagei (mm): P3L=1.25, P3W=0.70, P4L=1.70, P4W=l.OO, M~W=1.50, M2L=1.80, M2W=1.55.
COMMENTS ON PLAGIOCTENOIDES BOWN, 1979
Plagioctenoides microlestes was erected by Bown (1979, p. 65) to accomodate six mandibular specimens of a very small insectivore. At the time of its descnption, P mlcrolestes was believed to be a sensu lato adapisoricid, largely because of the morphology of P4• The molar morphology, however, seems more consistent with our revised concept of the nyctitheriids .in (1) the trenchant cusps, (2) the deep hypoflexid and long cristid obliqua, (3) the unreduced hypoconulids, and (4) the relatively tall, piercing hypoconids. If this assessment is correct, Plagwctenmdes is the smallest known nyctitherhd and has an antemolar dentition most like that of late Ludian Amphldozothenum in the possession of reduced, single-rooted P1_3 (Crochet, 1974; Sige, 1977).

Discusswn.-Gentetodon1patratus is the oldest known species currently assigned to this genus or to the Geolabididae. The type and other UCMP specimens and the referred Willwood material are all associated with undoubted early Wasatchian faunas and demonstrate that the peculiar morphology of the cheek teeth in Centetodon was established early and persisted in Its general form for about 15 million years. C patratus is closest in morphology to C.
pulcher, a species reported from several localities in the Bridger Formation of southwestern Wyoming (J. A. Lillegraven and M. C. McKenna, unpub. data), and possibly from locality VI of the Huerfano Formation (Krishtalka, 1975, p. 98).'
YPM 23088 differs from the type of C. patratus in having a slightly less exodaenodont M1 talonid; damage to several cusps gives the impression that the entoconids are not so lingually inflected as in the type. The general sculpture of the teeth in both specimens is quite similar, though, and it is highly probable that they represent the
same species. C. patratus differs from C puleher principally in the structure of P4
(for example, better developed talonid basm and cristid obhqua, larger P4 paraconid, and P4 slightly larger with respect to M1 in C patratus). All these characters are probably generalized for the genus, if one assumes that there was either a dormaaliid-like or a Batodon-like mammal in the ancestry of Centetodon (the latter idea was suggested by M. C. McKenna, oral commun, 1974, and by McKenna zn Novacek, 1976, p. 33) The morphology of the cheek teeth in Centetodon is remarkably uniform in all species P4 is the most diagnostic tooth, with the combination of the very tall, acute protoconid-metaconid moiety of the trigonid, the lower but distinct and anteriorly projecting paracomd moiety, the steep, flat postvallid, and the labial bulge of enamel beneath the hypoflexid being a unique construction. These characters appear to have been extremely long lived within the Centetodon lineage and have persisted with only rela-

If YPM 27500 were eliminated from the hypodigm of C. neashami (its referral is provi-
sional), the size discrepancy is even more marked (23-42 percent for P4, 20-26 percent for M1). Both the type of C. neasham" and YPM 27011 are from relatively high levels of the Willwood Formation (470-m level and indetermmate upper Gray Bull zone level, respec-
tively); whereas, YPM 23088 (C patratus) is from considerably lower (140-m level), and YPM locality 290N (provenance of YPM 25700) is
almost certainly intermediate (indeterminate level, probably in lower
part of middle Gray Bull zone). Centetodon neashami IS clearly distinct from other samples of
Eocene and Oligocene Centetodon. Only the unique specimen of Brule Formation (middle Oligocene) C wolffi approaches the new species in
size, and the PrM1 morphology of C neashami is, like that of C patratus, more generalized than in known Bridgerian, Uintan, or Chadronian species.

The talonid of M3 1s damaged; however, the contour and length of the tooth suggest that the M3 talonid was relatively short and did not possess a prominent posterobasal cusp. The buccal margin of the M2 talonid is slightly more expanded posteriorly than m Aptemodus and Olzgoryctes; but, as in these genera, the talonid shelf is relatively unbasined and has no distinct cusps. Paraptemodus, in addition to Aptemodus and Oligoryctes, is only the third apternodontid to be described; all are from lower Tertiary rocks. Hough (1956) reviewed the then-known apternodontids and recommended the resurrection of Simpson's (1931) family. G. G. Simpson (in McGrew and others, 1959, p. 151), West (1969, p. 88), and West and Atkins (1970, p. 20) have recorded the presence of a fourth, as yet undescribed apternodontid genus from rocks of late Bridgerian age at Tabernacle Butte, Sublette County, Wyo. (for example, AMNH 55689). AMNH 55689, CM 13627 (also from Tabernacle Butte, McKenna and others, 1962), and several other teeth of this animal from the Green River Formation of Utah (Powder Wash locality, early Bridgerian) are being studied by M C. McKenna (oral commun., 1979). Romer (1966, p. 381) and Novacek (1976, p. 34) have published McKenna's manuscript name for this animal as a nomen nudum (Eoryctes). Though Paraptemodus is considerably older than materials of "Eoryctes," the latter animal is much more generahzed in the known parts of the dentition.

Paraptemodus is clearly referable to the Apternodontidae by virtue of its transverse molar trigonids and greatly reduced talonids. The generic ties of the new genus are less clear, but the hypertrophied molars link it more closely to Oligoryctes and Aptemodus than to "Eoryctes", a form typified by its relatively short molar tngomds. Although Paraptemodus is the oldest documented representative of its family (but see Sloan, 1969, fig. 6), the possession of a relatively short Ms that lacks a talonid cusp is almost certainly derived relative to this tooth in all other apternodontids. The hypertrophied molar trigonids of Aptemodus, Paraptemodus, and Oligoryctes may be either generalized or derived, depending on whether one favors a palaeoryctid or dormaaliid (or other) antecedent for this family (Van Valen, 1967). The narrow trigomds with small prevallid and postvallid surfaces, the less anteroposteriorly compressed trigonids, and the expanded ventrolabial margin of the M2 talonid are characters shared by Paraptemodus and "Eoryctes" that are probably generalized with respect to Oligoryctes and Aptemodus.
Aside from the apparently reduced Ms talomd in Paraptemodus, this early Wasatchian insectivore appears to be suitably generalized for inclusion in the ancestry of known Oligocene apternodontids. Unfortunately, the ascending ramus of the mandible is unknown for the new genus, and it is uncertain whether or not this insectivore possessed a soricid-like mandible like that m "Eoryctes" (AMNH 55689; G. G. Simpson, m McGrew and others, 1959) and Oll,goryctes (for example, slender Jaw with shallow external temporal fossa, deep triangular posterointernal ramal fossa, large angular process, condyle placement and configuration, deep inferior pterygoid fossa), or a more robust, divergently specialized mandible as in Aptemodus

D-,scussion.-This specimen may be of an unusual insectivore or a microchiropteran; however, these two teeth do not closely resemble molars of any mammal known to us.

However, examination of the antenor and lmgual borders of the tooth and comparison with M2(?) indicate that the peculiar mor-

phology probably does not result from postmortem damage. It is also

conceivable that the teeth represent the deciduous P3_4 of a dormaaliid-like Macrocranwn, dormaaliid sp. A, or the erinaceid

Eolestes. There is, however, no indication of an unerupted permanent

?M1_2 are characterized by extremely narrow trigonids, and ?M1 has a very broad, acute talonid. The paraconid is a large shelf that pro-

Jects anterolingually from the trigonid, and the protoconid is situated

well anterior to the metaconid, resulting in a trigonid basin that is

oriented anterolingually-posterolabially. Judging from ?M2, the metaconid appears to have been considerably taller than the proto-

conid. The cristid obliqua joins the base of the metaconid, and the

labial part of the postcristid is of equal length as the cristid obliqua

and is nearly straight, imparting a symmetrical, V-shaped configura-

tion to the talonid. The hypocomd is very low, the hypoconuhd is

large and medial, and the entoconid is tall, trenchant, and lingually

Type specimen.-AMNH 16169, left ramus with PrM2, and associated tarsal bones.
Localzty.-"lower Gray Bull beds, Coon Creek, Garland Road, Big Hom Basin, Wyoming."
Discusswn.-Originally compared with the Artiodactyla, Creodonta, Condylarthra, and Insectivora by Matthew and Granger (1918), Creotarsus remains an animal of enigmatic affinities. Van Valen (1967) placed the genus in the sensu lato Adapisoricidae, along with such morphologically disparate forms as Lztolestes, Amphzlemur, Amphidozotherium, and Ictopidzum, but Creotarsus does not closely resemble any of the sensu stricto dormaaliids. P4 is similar to that in the didelphodontine palaeoryctid Didelphodus, but the molars are wholly dissimilar. P4 also resembles that in several condylarths, for example, Bisonalveus, but again the molars are different, and are closer to Palaeosinopa. It seems likely that Creotarsus is most closely related to the Pantolestidae, but its affinities will remain uncertain until better material is available.

SUMMARY
The lower Eocene Willwood Formation of the Bighorn Basin in northwest Wyoming has the largest and most diverse representation of proteutherian and insectivore mammals in the Western Hemisphere. A new sample of about 330 specimens, collected from several different stratigraphic levels of the Willwood Formation, clarifies evolutionary patterns and variation in these animals when compared with specimens of similar age from elsewhere.
The Willwood fauna (including several new taxa) indicates that the radiation of the hpotyphian msectivores was well underway by Wasatchian trme and probably began much earlier. Two groups much better represented in younger rocks, the Apternodontidae and the Geolabididae, were already clearly differentiated by early Eocene time. They are represented by new taxa that record the earliest known occurrences of these families.
The Dormaaliidae, originally described from the Sparnacian of Europe, are abundantly represented in the North American Wasatchian, and North American and European nyctitheriids show several similarities. These similarities indicate that the well-documented Clarkforkian through Wasatchian faunal interchange with Europe also included a variety of small lipotyphlan insectivores. Stratigraphic ranges of some of these animals in the Willwood FormatiOn suggest that proteutherians and insectivores have potential value as guide fossils when they are better known. Figure 18 on page 48 depicts the known stratigraphic ranges of Willwood proteutherians and insectivores with reference to the biostratigraphic zones discussed in the text and illustrated in figure 1. The proteuthenans and insectivores now known from the Willwood Formation are summarized as follows:
