This Open-File Report consists of five 35-mm slides that present preliminary geologic data for the Butte 1° x 2° quadrangle, western Montana. The first two slides are a generalized geologic map and explanation compiled by R. G. Schmidt that shows the main assemblages of rock units and major structures in the the Butte 1° x 2° quadrangle. This slide shows Q, Quaternary deposits; T, Tertiary deposits; Mz, Mesozoic formations; Pz, Paleozoic formations; Ym, Missoula Group (Proterozic Y); Yw, Wallace Formation (Proterozic Y); Yh, Helena Formation (Proterozoic Y); Yr, Ravalli Group (Proterozoic Y); TV, Tertiary volcanic rocks; Kv, Cretaceous volcanic rocks; TKi, Tertiary and Cretaceous volcanic rocks; Kr, Cretaceous volcanic rocks; Zd, Proterozoic Z diorite and gabbro. The third slide is a hand-colored version of the Open-File Map of the Butte 1° x 2° quadrangle (Wallace and others, 1981). The fourth slide is a hand-colored version of the explanation for the east part of the Butte 1° x 2° quadrangle (Wallace and others, 1981). The fifth slide is a hand-colored version of the explanation for the west part of the Butte 1° x 2° quadrangle (Wallace and others, 1981). Lettering on the third, fourth, and fifth slides is not legible when projected, but these can be used as a color guide in conjunction with OpenFile Map 81-1030 of parts of the Butte 1° x 2° quadrangle (Wallace and others, 1981).
