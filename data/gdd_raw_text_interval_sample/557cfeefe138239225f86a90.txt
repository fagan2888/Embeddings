DETACHMENT FAULTS IN THE CENTRAL SANTA MONICA MOUNTAINS, CALIFORNIA
By R. H. CAMPBELL, R. F. YERKES, and C. M. WENTWORTH, Menlo Park, Calif.
Work done in cooperation with Los AngeZes County, OaZif.

Abstraot.-The central Santa Monica Mountains are made up of sedimentary and volcanic rocks of Late Cretaceous through middle Miocene age that are probably underlain at depth by older metasedimentary and igneous rocks of the Rort exposed in the core of the Eastern Santa Monica Mountains. Structurally, these strata form an autochthon ( ?) and three detachment thrust sheets that were emplaced during latest middle Miocene time, apparently from a source to the north. The thrust sheets are superimposed upon one another in a stratiform sequence which, in turn, bas been folded and faulted, and dilated by igneous intrusion. On the south, these rocks and structures are truncated by the Malibu Coast fault, which trends east-west along the southern flank of the range.

The Santa Monica Mountains trend east-west along the north side of Santa Monica Bay and the northwest side of the Los Angeles basin (fig. 1). The range lies

at the southern edge of the east-west-trending Transverse Range·s province; farther south of the range the general northwesterly trends of the Peninsular Ranges province predominate in the largely submerged continental borderland. The rocks of the Santa Monicn Mountains are complexly. folded and faulted, and the geology is further complicated by facies changes in several of the time--stratigraphic units. Since 1961, the U.S. Geological Survey, in cooperation with Los Angeles County, has been mapping ·the geology of the central part of the range at a scale of 1:12,000. Although the mapping is far from complete and many problems remain, the structural, stratigraphic, and paleontologic data gathered to date clearly demonstrate that thrust faults (detachment faults) _dominate the structure of the main mass of the central Santa Monica Mountains. Low-angle thrust faults have not been recognized in this area by earlier investigators (Dur·· rell, 1954; Bailey and Jahns, 1954; Soper, 1938; and Hoots, 1931); nevertheless, most of the rock distribution shown on their maps is readily reconciled with the structural framework described herein.
The main mass of the central Santa Monica Mountains lies north of the west-trending Malibu Coast fault (fig. 2), where the strata consist of sedimentary and volcanic rocks of Late Cretaceous through middle Miocene age (fig. 3) that are probably unde.rlain by older metasedimentary and igneous rocks of the sort exposed in the core of the eastern Santa Monica Mountains (Durrell, 1954). Structurally, these rocks form an autochthon ( ~) and three superimposed thrust sheets: in ascending order, the Tuna Canyon, Zuma, and Malibu Bowl thrust sheets, each of which is named for the thrust fault beneath it.

has resulted in a stratiform sequence that has subsequently been folded and faulted, and dilated by the intrusion of mafic and intermediate igneous rock. The Zuma sheet is the most widely exposed of the thrust sheets; the autochthon ( ~) and the Tuna Canyon sheet. are exposed in windows cut through it, and the Malibu Bowl sheet is represented by outliers on top of it. The north, east, and west limits of the thrust sheets have not as yet been: ascertained. On the south, these rocks and structures end abruptly at the Malibu Coast fault.
The Tuna Canyon, Zuma, and Malibu Bowl thrusts are detachment faults (following the usage of Pierce, 1963, p. 1226) that, for the most part, bring younger rocks over older rocks along surfaces that are parallel or nearly parallel to bedding in the rocks of the upper plate. The thrusts are unambiguously recognizable only where they break across the bedding of the upperplate rocks (for examples see figs. 4 and 6). From the relatively few localities where these discordant relations are found, the thrusts have been traced through contiguous areas of accordant relations, and correlated across discontinuities of exposure by the rather distinctive stratigraphic intervals associated with each thrust sheet. Exposures of the actual thrust surfaces are rare; the few found expose either a zone of brecciated rock (generally 1ess than 2 feet thick, but locally thicker) or a filling of intrusive igneous rock. The traces of the faults are, however, sufficiently controlled by outcrops of the juxtaposed rock units to establish that gentle dips predominate. In localities where beds in the upper plate are accordant with the underlying fault surfaces, and where lower-plate rocks are older than upper-plate rocks, the detachment thrusts might be misinterpreted as unconformable sedimentary contacts, perhaps complicated by high-angle faults. In such areas consistency with the regional structural and stratigraphic framework is the best guide to the nature of unexposed contacts.
South of the Malibu Coast fault, a greatly different sequence of strata is present (fig. 3). Although undoubtedly widespread beneath the waters of Santa Monica Bay, the rocks are known best from exposures in the narrow strip of relatively low-lying coastland extending east and west from Point Dume. The strata of this coastal strip correlate with those of the western part of the Los Angeles basin (see Woodford and others, 1954), whereas the strata of the main mass of the mountains correlate with those to the north and east in the Transverse Ranges, and with those of the eastern part of the Los Angeles basin. The geologic structures of the coastal strip trend generally east,

approximately parallel to the general trend of the Santa Monica Mountains. There is, however, no evident direct association of these structures (including at least one thrust fault-the Escondido thrust) with the thrust faults to the north. Indeed, the structures of the coastal strip involve rocks that are younger than the probable youngest thrusting of rocks in the main mountain mass. They are most probably intimately associated .with the Malibu Coast fault.
THE AUTO·CHTHON(?)
The autochthon ( ~) is below the lowest of the recognized thrust faJ.lts of the tectonically layered sequence. It is exposed in windows through the overlying thrust sheets in Topanga Canyon and in an elongate irregular area extending about 3 miles west-northwest from the mouth of the Topanga Canyon. Windows in Zuma
nCanyon and Trancas Canyon (fig. 5) expose rocks that
also belong to the autochthon( unless the Tuna Canyon thrust is present below the deepest exposures. The rocks of the autochthon ( ~) are chiefly sandstone of Late Cretaceo.us age, overlain conformably ( ~ ) jn a few places by conglomerate and sandstone of Paleocene age. The beds are folded and faulted. Strikes and dips vary widely, but west to northwest strikes are most common, and a general asymmetry of the folding, with north-dipping axial planes, is suggested by the overall predominance of gentle dips of the north-facing beds and steeper dips of the south-facing beds. Moreover, the only recognized overturned beds face southward and dip steeply northward. In most places, exposures are inadequate to obtain a complete, detailed understanding of the structure within the autochthon ( ~) . Nevertheless, the rocks seem to have been at least gently folded before the lowest overlying thrust sheet was emplaced.
THRUST SHEETS
Tuna Canyon thrust sheet
The Tuna Canyon thrust sheet and the Tuna Canyon thrust fault at its base are named for exposures in Tuna Canyon. The Tuna Canyon sheet is the lowest of the recognized thrust sheets. It is exposed in windows that have been eroded through the younger overlying thrust sheets in an irregular area extending from the east side of Topanga Canyon westward for about 4 miles. To the north and southeast it is overlain by the rocks of the two higher thrust sheets. It is inferred to be present southeast of Saddle Peak, in a window bounded by the North and South Las Flores thrust faults

C6 STRUCTURAL GEOLOGY

FIGURE 4.-The Zuma thrust fault; view southwestward of the east side of a ridge east of Trancas Canyon. The fault here is a nearly flat surface as is well defined by its sinuous trace along a fixed altitude on the slope of the ridge; it is also found on
the west side of the same ridge and on the hillside in the background. Marine Paleocene rocks (T ma) are exposed below the thrust. Above the thrust, marine lower Miocene rocks (Tva) overlie continental sandstone and conglomerate of the Sespe Formation (Ts) at A, an accordant depositional contact (dotted where concealed beneath landslide, Qls). Both the bedding within the Sespe (B) and the contact (A) are truncated at their contact-the Zuma thrust-with the older rocks below.

(fig. 5). It has not been recognized in the windows of Zuma and Trancas Canyons, and its continuation at depth is not inferred to extend that far west (structure section C-C', fig. 5).
The rocks of the exposed segments of the Tuna Canyon thrust sheet are almost exclusively Paleocene in age. Conglomerate, overlain by sandstone and siltstone, predominates in the Topanga and Tuna Canyon areas. Farther west, conglomerate is less abundant and sandstone predominates. A small thickness of Cretaceous sandstone belonging to the Tuna Canyon sheet is exposed beneath Paleocene conglomerate in a small area in the head of Tuna Canyon. The contact appears to be conformable, except for minor scour features. The same depositional contact is exposed in the autochthon ( ~) on the east side of To-

panga Canyon and on the east side of Tuna Canyon (fig. 2) . The Tuna Canyon thrust sheet is the only one that contains rocks and a contact that are also found in the autochthon ( ~), and, therefore, it might be regarded as parautochthonous in comparison with the allochthonous Zuma and Malibu Bow1 sheets.
Although the Tuna Canyon thrust fault is parallel or nearly parallel to the bedding of the upper-plate rocks in many places, it locally cuts across that bedding. The relations suggest gently folded beds cut by a nearly planar fault that was subsequently folded and faulted.
Zuma thrust sheet
The Zuma thrust sheet and the Zuma thrust fault. at its base are named for exposures between Zuma

CAMPBELL, YE.RKES, AN.D WENTWORTH

C7

and Trancas Canyons (figs. 4 and 5). There, the Zuma sheet overlies rocks that apparently belong to the autochthon ( ~). Farther east it overlies rocks of the Tuna Canyon thrust sheet except in a few small
n.areas where it cuts out the Tuna Canyon sheet and lies
directly on the autochthon ( The fluvial(~) continental sandstone and conglo-
meratic sandstone of the Sespe Formation (fig. 3) are the most distinctive and widespread rocks of the Zuma thrust sheet. The Sespe is known only in the Zuma thrust sheet and has not been found in the autochthon ( ~) or in the other thrust sheets. The Zuma sheet also carries marine and continental sandstone, siltstone, and mudstone of early and middle Miocene age (the Lower Topanga Formation of Durrell, 1954) , which overlie the Sespe Formation and are, in turn, overlain by basaltic and andesitic volcanic rocks of middle Miocene age (the Middle Topanga Formation of Durrell, 1954) (fig. 3). The only place where pre-Sespe· rocks are probably included in the Zuma thrust sheet is in the upper part of Solstice Canyon. There, fossiliferous conglomerate, sandstone, and siltstone of Paleocene and Eocene age underlie the Sespe apparently in a normal depositional sequence.
The rocks of the Zuma thrust sheet were probably folded before, as well as after, the displacement on the Zuma thrust occurred. Although the thrust fault is parallel or nearly parallel to the bedding of the upper-plate rocks in most places, it locally cuts across bedding and faults of the upper plate, with relations suggesting thU~t previously folded and faulted beds were cut by a nearly planar fault. Locally, the Zuma thrust cuts out the Tuna Canyon thrust sheet (fig. 5, section 0-0'; fig. 6). The Zuma thrust sheet was also folded and cut by high-angle faults prior to the emplacement of the higher Malibu Bowl thrust sheet (fig. 5, section 0-0; fig. 6).
Malibu Bowl thrust sheet
The Malibu Bowl thrust sheet and thrust fault are named for a topographic amphitheater at the head of Corral Canyon. Newton (1958) mapped the Malibu Bowl fault from there westward to Zuma Canyon and southeastward to its intersection with the Malibu Coast fault. The largest single exposure of the Malibu Bowl sheet is an elongate area about 2 miles wide, extending from about ll/2 miles west of Malibu Canyon westward to the east side of Zuma Canyon. Exposures farther east are restricted to the extreme northeast corner of the map area (fig. 2), to small outliers in the Topanga quadrangle, and to a narrow strip near the coast.
The rocks exposed in the Malibu Bowl thrust sheet

include lower and middle Miocene marine sandstone, siltstone, and n1inor conglomerate (Lower Topanga Formation of Durrell, 1954), overlain by basaltic and andesitic extrusive volcanic rocks of varying thickness (Middle Topanga Formation of Durrell, 1954) succeeded by and intertonguing with marine sandstone and siltstone of middle Miocene age (Upper Topanga Formation of Durrell, 1954) (fig. 3) . Several outliers and horses (bounded by thrust faults), chiefly of lower Miocene marine sandstone and siltstone appear to be slivers peeled from the base of the Malibu Bowl sheet.
The Malibu Bowl thrust cuts both the Tuna Canyon and Zuma thrust faults. The Malibu Bowl thrust is commonly parallel or nearly parallel to the bedding in the upper plate. Although the fault locally cuts across bedding in the upper plate, there is no clear indication that upper-plate folds are truncated. The underlying thrust sheets, however, were probably folded prior to emplacement of the Malibu Bowl sheet. At the anticline that crosses Topanga Canyon, for example, the Zuma and Tuna Canyon thrust faults are arched with greater amplitude than that of the Malibu Bowl thrust (fig. 6).
Age and: origin
Crosscutting relations suggest a chronologie sequence of thrust sheets, with the Tuna Canyon thrust sheet first, followed by the Zuma and Malibu Bowl sheets. Nevertheless, they may be very close in age. The 1\{alibu Bowl sheet includes rocks of middle Miocene age and, from interpretation of maps published by Hoots (1931) and Durrell (1954), the thrust f:tults are cut by the unconformity at the base of the Modelo Formation of late 1\{iocene age, about 2 miles north of the map area of figures 2 and 5. The thrust sheets were, therefore, probably emplaced during late middle Miocene.
The thrust plates are tentatively inferred to have moved from north to south. This is based on the absence, south of the Malibu coast fault, of strata that could have provided the rocks in the thrust sheets, and on the present general east-west structural trends which are presumed to be approximately perpendicular to the direction of movement. This presumption assumes, of course, that the late middle Miocene trends were not greatly different from, nor obscured by, those formed in subsequent deformation. The general youngerover-older sense of displacement of the thrust sheets indicates detachment and translation of relatively shallow younger strata over n1ore stable, deeper, older rocks, and, therefore, suggests that the thrusting was a near-surface phenomenon of the sort often considered to be associated with gravity tectonics. To
the north, the nearest uplifted area that might have

served as a source for gravity thrust sheets is the Simi Hills; however, much more work must be done to test the validity of speculations concerning origin.
LATER DEFORMATION AND IGNEOUS INTRUSION
Deformation of a different style followed the emplacement of the Malibu Bowl thrust sheet. A large asymmetric anticline, trending east-west and having a north-dipping axial surface, distorted the tectonically layered sequence (fig. 6). The anticline extends from as far west as Trancas Canyon eastward beyond the edge of the mapped area, and its crest commonly lies from 1 to 1.1;2 miles north of the Malibu Coast fault (see sections A-A' and B-B', fig. 5). The anticline apparently began to form after the emplacement of the Tuna Canyon thrust sheet and continued to grow during and after the emplacement of the Zuma and Malibu Bowl sheets. The Las Flores thrust faults, which carried older rocks from the crestal zone of the anticline southward (section B-B', fig. 5), are probably break thrusts associated with the late stages of the anticlinal folding.
Large quantities of diab_ase, andesite, and basalt were forcibly intruded, probab}.y at about the same time or slightly' later than mov~ment along the Las Flores faults. Some intrusives were probably emplaced earlier, and intrusion may have begun even before the earliest thrusting; but one of the largest igneous masses was intruded along the Malibu Bowl thrust (fig. 6), and some small bodies were intruded along the Las Flores faults. The igneous rocks were forcibly emplaced, dilating the section. Dikes, most only a few feet thick, and small irregular bodies are abundant; the larger intrusive bodies are sill-like masses, filling thrust faults or bedding planes.
Very large displacement along the Malibu Coast fault postdates virtually all the structures of the mountain mass to th~ north of it. This fault clearly cuts many structures that intersect it from both sides, but

their offset segments have not been recognized. The stratigraphic sections juxtaposed along the fault are greatly different (fig. 3), and Yerkes and Wentworth1 conclude that it is a deep-seated thrust along which the southern margin of the Transverse Range province overrides the continental borderland to the south. Very large displacement along the Malibu Coast fault certainly postdates the deposition of the upper Miocene (Mohnian) beds of the Monterey Shale now exposed on Point Dume. Although the Malibu Coast fault may well have originated earlier, the local evidence does not require movement prior to latest Miocene.
Upper Pleistocene deposits are cut in a few places by :q1inor faults that are probably associated with Malibu Coast fault deformation, but the deposits are generally not offset more than a few feet to a few tens of feet. The deposits are thus younger than the very large displacement of the upper Miocene rocks. In a few places, especially just east of the mouth of Topanga Canyon, minor displacement of Pleistocene deposits has occurred along segments of the older thrust faults that apparently provided preexisting planes of weakness along which there was some adjustment in response to the late deforming forces.

MIOCENE STRUCTURAL MOVEMENTS IN THOMAS COUNTY, GEORGIA Bv CHARLES W. SEVER, Tifton, Ga.
Prepared in cooperation with the Georgia Department of Mines, Mining, and Geology

Abstract.-Rocks of Oligocene and Miocene age in Thomas County, in the Coastal Plain province in southwestern Georgia, are gently folded and are transected by at least one northeast-trending fault. Maximum displacement along the fault is at least 190 feet and may be somewhat greater. Structural deformation began during Oligocene time, or at least before the Tampa Limestone (early Miocene) was deposited, and continued spasmodically through middle Mio· cene and possibly through late Miocene time. The trends of the Miocene structures parallel those of late Paleozoic structures in the Appalachian tectonic province in Georgia. The parallel trends suggest that the older Paleozoic structures in some way have controlled the Miocene structures.
Evidence for a northeast-trending fault and for downwarping to the northwest and upwarping to the southeast of it has been collected during a study of the ground-water resources of Thomas County, Ga. The purpose of this paper is to describe and name the structural features, to indicate their geologic age, and to relate them to the regional structural framework. Thomas County, whi~h is in the southwestern part of the State at the Georgia-Florida boundary, is situated between the Chattahoochee anticline and the Ocala uplift, both of which are important structural features of the Coastal Plain physiographic province.
LOCATION AND AGE OF GEOLOGIC STRUCTURES
The evidence of faulting and folding in Thomas County can be presented best in the form of structurecontour maps and a cross section which illustrate the folds and a break in each ·of two stratigraphic zones. These zones- the Suwannee Limestone of Oligocene age and the Tampa Limestone of early Miocene ageeach are easily recognized stratigraphic units.
In Thomas County the Suwannee Limestone, the principal aquifer, generally is a white, nonsandy, porous, oolitic, fossiliferous limestone that at places

is almost a microcoquina. The foraminifer Pararotalia 1nexicana mecatepecensis Nuttall (Rotalia mexicana of former usage) generally can be found in cuttings from the upper part of the Suwannee Limestone. throughout Thomas County. This foraminiferal species is considered by Herrick and Vorhis (1963, p. 13) to be diagnostic of the Oligocene in Georgia. Other diagnostic species listed by them include Quinquelo()ulina leonensis Applin and Jordan, Oa1nerina dia (Cole and Ponton)-, Asterigerina subac.uta Cushman var. fior-idensis Applin and Jordan, and Lepidocyclina mantelli (Morton). The Suwannee Limestone can be distinguished frmn overlying Miocene limestone by the absence of sand in the Suwannee and by diagnostic Foraminifera.
Contour lines drawn on the top of the Suwanne Limestone (fig. 1) show that the formation is downfolded into a northeast·plunging basin near Meigs, in northwestern Thomas County. This structure, here named the Meigs basin, is part of a much larger, generally southwest-plunging trough called the Gulf trough by Herrick and Vorhis (1963, p. 55 and 67). The contour lines also show that in the central part of Thomas County the Suwanee Limestone has been unfolded along a northeast-trending arch. This structure is here named the Barwick arch. Separating these two structures is a northeast-trending fault that is here named the Ochlockonee fault, after the river of this name.1 Rocks on the southeast side of the fault are upthrown; the amount of displacement generally increases to the northeast.
Along the Ochlockonee fault the top of the Suwannee Limestone has been displaced 100 to 190 feet.

S'I1RUCTURAL GEOLOGY

Thus faulting occurred after this formation was deposited. Although data are inadequate to determine whether any of the faulting occurred earlier, partial dolomitization of Eocene and Oligocene limestones within the Meigs basin, together with other evidence, indicates that the basin may have been downwarped prior to Miocene time.
Throughout Thomas County-except near the axis of the Meigs basin-the uppermost 3 to 10 feet of the Suwannee Limestone is very permeable. Probably the permeability is the result of solution during exposure of the formation to weathering during earliest Miocene time. That the weathering did not produce significant relief is indicated by the nearly uniform thickness (150 to 180 feet) of the Suwannee throughout the county. Upwarping of the Barwick arch southeast of the Ochlockonee fault is postulated tentatively because the contours on the top of the Suwannee (as well as those on the top of the overlying Tampa Limestone) indicate possible deformation of .a weathered or erosional surface that presumably had been nearly horizontal.
The Tampa Limestone of early Miocene age overlies the Suwannee Limestone. The lower member of the Tampa is predominantly yellowish-gray to greenishgray sandy marl with interbedded thin, white, very sandy beds of lin1estone, and the upper member is an easily recognized gray to brown, dense, cherty, phosphatic, sandy limestone. This upper member (the Chattahoochee Formation of previous usage) is easily distinguished from other Miocene limestone units by its color; by its sand content; by its dense cherty texture, which causes a prominent high anomaly on electric logs; by its phosphate, which contains traces of uranium that cause a distinctively high anomaly on gamma-radiation logs; and by its fossils, which include specimens of the Foraminifera Archaias sp. and Sorites sp.., and numerous fragments of large shells.
Contour lines drawn on the top of the Tampa Limestone (fig. 2) show that it too is downfolded in the Meigs basin and upfolded along the Barwick arch. The upper member of the Tampa Limestone and, locally, the Suwannee Limestone are exposed along the crest of the Barwick arch. Along the Ochlockonee fault the top of the Tampa has been displaced about 80 to 100 feet, or about 20 to 100 feet less than the displacement of the top of the Suwannee Limestone. This difference in displacement indicates that some movement occurred along the Ochlockonee fault after deposition of the Suwannee and before deposition of the upper member of the Tampa. Differences in the thickness of the lo,ver member of the Tampa Limestone
(fig. 3) northwest of the fault, together with absence of rthe lower Jnember southeast of the fault, indicate that

at least part of the movement occurred during early Miocene time and was contemporaneous with deposition of the lower member northwest of the fault.
Because the upper member of the Tampa Limestone has about the same maximum thickness and the same lithology on both sides of the fault, this member must have been deposited during an interval of relative stability. However, displacement of this member across the Ochlockonee fault shows that additional movement along the fault occurred after this member was deposited.
Southeast of the Ochlockonee fault the Tampa Limestone was uplifted at the end of early Miocene time, and, at a few places (fig. 3), deep channels were incised through the Tampa and into the upper part of the Suwannee.
Sands and clays of the Alum Bluff Group of early and middle Miocene age, which were deposited on this irregular surface, filled the channels. Since deposition, beds of the Alum Bluff Group have been folded and at places faulted. l\{any of these structures obviously were caused by differential compaction within the Alum Bluff Group, and others probably were caused by continuing solution and collapse of the underlying limestones. However, some of these structures may have been caused by continued uplift of the Barwick arch during middle Miocene to late Miocene time.
Northwest of the Ochlockonee fault, the Alum Bluff Group appears to overlie the Tampa Limestone conformably. 'Vithin the l\{eigs basin this group is divisible into three mappable zones: a lower zone of sandy marl; a middle zone of phosphatic sandstone that causes a high anomaly on gamma-radiation logs; and an upper zone of fuller's earth. Changes in lithology and thickening of these zones within the basin indicate that folding and faulting probably occurred during middle l\1:iocene time prior to or contemporaneous with the deposition of these zones. The lower zone cannot be traced with confidence across the Ochlockonee fault, but the lithology of the unit shown as undifferentiated Alum Bluff Group on figure 3 is similar to this zone. Possibly the thinning of the middle zone near the fault indicates that some movement occurred during deposition of this zone. vVithin the l\{eigs basin, commercial deposits of nttapulgite and fuller's earth an"'. present in the upper zone. Similar deposits are absent southeast of the Ochlockonee fault. Data are insufficient to determine whether the absence of these beds is clue to their removal by erosion or to nondeposition.
Overlying the Alum Bluff Group within the Meigs basin is the Citronelle Formation, which consists of as muc.h as 90 feet of gravel and· coarse sand of terrestrial or1gu1 (fig. 3). On the Barwick arch this

Southeast of the Barwick arch, sands in the lower part of Citronelle intertongue with shallow-water marine beds in which the author and several others have found numerous fossil mammal teeth. The teeth were identified as Merychippus sp. and Diceratherium sp. by Olsen (1963), who considers them to be of late Miocene age. The areal distribution of the Citronelle indicates that the Barwick arch may have been uplifted again after the Citronelle was deposited.
RELATION TO REGIONAL STRUCTURAL TRENDS
The Ochlockonee fault and the axes of the Meigs basin and Barwick arch trend parallel to the Chatahoochee anticline (fig. 4) as relocated by Sever (1965). All these structures are oriented parallel to the structural trend in the Appalachian tectonic province in Georgia, as it is shown on figure 4 by the trend of the Brevard fault zone. The parallel trends suggest that the older Paleozoic struciures have controlled in some way the Miocene structures in Thomas County.
All these structural trends are almost normal to the general northwestern structural trend of the Ocala uplift in Florida.

PRE-MIDDLE DEVONIAN AND POST-MIDDLE DEVONIAN FAULTING AND THE SILURIAN-DEVONIAN UNCONFORMITY NEAR RICHMOND, KENTUCKY
By GEORGE C. SIMMONS, Berea, Ky.
Wo1·1c done in C001JC1'at-ion 1.V'ith the Kent'ucky Geological Survey

Abst,ract.-Two periods of movement on northwest-trending faults are recognized by differences in amount of offset of Silurian and Devonian formations and by the results of prel\liclclle Devonian erosion. Initial faulting occurred nfter deposition of the Crab Orchard Formation, and probably the Bisher ( 'l) Limestone. Subsequent erosion almost completely removed the Bisher ( ?) and produced a nearly level surface on the Crab Orchard. Consequently, only lower parts of the Crab Orchard remain on upthrown sides of faults ; thicker sections are present on downthrown sides. Faulting again occurred after the Boyle Dolomite and the lower part of the New Albany Shale were deposited.

Recent mapping has delineated a system of northwest-trending faults in Ordovician, Silurian, and Devonian strata near Richmond, 1\::y. The faults, ineluding one which was recognized by Campbell (1898) n.nd another by Jillson (1964), lie between the northeast-trending l{entucky River and Irvine fault zones (fig. 1). Two periods of movement on northweststriking faults are recognized in the Palmer and Union City quadrangles (fig. 1). The first period of faulting occurred prior to the development of the unconformity n.t the base of Devonian rocks in central l{entucky; the second took place during or after Middle Devonian time. The formations exposed in the Palmer quadrangle are listed in table 1.
The pre-Boyle age of the first period of faulting is inferred from the relation of the Boyle Dolomite to the Crab Orchard Formation; the Boyle overlies thinner sections and older beds of the Crab Orchard on the upthrown side of each fault than on the adjacent downthrown side. In the geologic section (fig. 2) showing a fault in the Palmer quadrangle, a stratigraphic difference of 20 feet exists between the upper-

1nost beds of the Crab Orchard on the opposite sides of the fault. An isopach map of the Crab Orchard Formation in the Palmer quadrangle (fig. 3) shows that this formation is thinner on the upthrown sides of faults than on the corresponding downthrown sides.
The second period of faulting was obviously younger than the Boyle Dolomite and the lower part of the New Albany Shale because these units were displaced. The upper possible age limit of this faulting is unknown because the upper part of the New Albany and younger rocks are absent in the faulted areas.
The total vertical displacement of the two periods of faulting is commonly about 40 feet; the 1naximum is about 80 feet. The amount of drag adjacent to the
faults is relatively great, and the difference in the elevation of correlative beds within a few hundred
yards of the faults is at some places three or more

The difference in offset is most easily determined in the field by comparing the displacement of the base of the Brassfield Forma-

tion with that of the base of the New Albany Shale. These contacts generally are well exposed, and the former was affected by both periods of faulting, whereas the latter was affected by only one.
At two places it is questionable whether the faults were active during post-Boyle time. Although Silu-

ri an rocks are offset more than 20 feet by both faults, the difference in elevation of Devonian strata on opposite sides of the projections of the faults is· only a few feet. As no faults are exposed in Devonian strata, the slight differences may result fron1 post-Boyle tilting rather than faulting. Thus, the fault on the southwest side of the l\1ina dome (fig. 4) and the north part of the longer of the two faults southeast of the dome rnay have been inactive during the second period of faulting.
The faults have no apparent economic significance. Because their northwest-southeast strike is parallel to the regional (southeast) dip, the faults have not created large closed structures which might serve as oil reservoirs. Small structural closures exist adjacent to a few faults as the result of differential movement and drag. One fault increased the closure on the Mina dome. No mineralization has been found along the faults.

Limestone and cut an almost level surface on the Crab Orchard. An isopach map of the Boyle Dolomite in·the Palmer quadrangle (fig. 4) shows that the Boyle was deposited as a thin layer on a surface of low topographic relief. In the southeast corner of the quadrangle two hills made up of Crab Orchard Formation and capped by Bisher ( ?) Limestone stood a few tens of feet above the l\1iddle Devonian sea. The Boyle Dolomite was deposited around the hills and wedged out against the Crab Orchard Formation on the hill slopes. Consequently, the Bisher ( ?) Limestone on the ancient hilltops stood at higher elevations than the younger Boyle Dolomite and lowest part of the New Albany Shale.

DESCRIPTION AND RELOCATION OF PART OF THE ILSE FAULT ZONE, WET MOUNTAINS, COLORADO
By 0. D. SINGEWALD, Beltsville, Md.

A.bstract.-New data on the Ilse fault zone, a major dislocation in the central Wet Mountains of Colorado, show that it extends northward and joins a fault previously known to cross the Arkansas River 1~ miles west of Parkdale. An ancestral llse fault antedated the Cambrian Period; it was a linear zone, variable in width and intensity of deformation, and transected the grain of Precambrian gneiss. Reactivation on a major scale, but not necessarily of equal intensity everywhere, moved the east wall relatively downward d~ring Laramide, or later time. Several strong radioactive anomalies were found north of hitherto reported thorium mineralization in the fault and southeast of it.
The lise fault zone, an important dislocation in the central Wet 1\'Iountains, is shown on the 1935 geologic map of Colorado (Burbank and others, 1935) as being nearly 17 miles long and having a prevailing trend of approximately N. 30° W., except at the north end, where near Grape Creek it is shown as striking nearly due north. Because Precambrian rocks occupy both walls throughout this stretch, .neither the age of the fault nor the direction and amount of movement along it could be determined in ea.rlier studies.
Geologic reconnaissance during 1964 shed new light on the character and age of the lise fault. The fault was found to extend 5 miles farther north-northwestward than thought previously and to connect with another fault that is shown l1;2 miles west of Parkdale on the geologic map of Colorado. The existence of an eastward extension of the latter fault was determined to be in error. Incidentally to the structural study, radioactive anomalies were found at several places north of hitherto reported thorium deposits. The revised fault pattern is compared on figure 1 with the pattern on the 1935 map. On a larger scale map (fig. 2), part of the lise fault is shown in relation to streams and contours copied from the newest topographic maps, and the prevailing foliation at different places is given.

rocks on opposite sides of the fault are not notably dissimilar.
BEDROCK ALONG FAULT
Mesozoic rocks, which are sharply uptilted in the east wall of the fault, lie east of the fault in the northern part of the area shown on figure 2 and continue northward for several miles. They include the Morrison Formation (Upper Jurassic) , Dakota Sandstone (Lower and Upper Cretaceous), and Benton Shale (Lower and Upper Cretaceous), as modified from the 1935 geologic map of Colorado (Burbank and others, 1935).
Elsewhere, bedrock is a crystalline complex· of Precambrian rocks cut by many dikes. These rocks have been described in the Mcl{inley Mountain area (Christman and others, 1959, p. 493-512). Most widespread along the lise fault are biotite-quartz-plagioclase gneiss and associated migmatite, horneblende-plagioclase gneiss and amphibolite, and alaskitic granite gneiss. These gneisses commonly occur together in irregularly alternating layers that may pinch or swell, interfinger, or grade into one another. "Basic dikes," whose feldspar ranges from calcic labradorite to calcic andesine, are more numerous but less persistent than syenite dikes. Most of these dikes in the Wet Mountains are very late Precambrian or, more probably, Early Cambrian in age (M. R. Brock and R. F. Marvin, unpub. data).
The detailed pattern of foliation, fissures, and dikes close to the lise fault remains very imperfectly known because outcrops are scarce and tend to be slumped. At a few places, gneiss less than a hundred feet from t.he fault seems little disturbed or altered. Elsewhere, a disturbed zone hundreds of feet wide borders at least one side of the fault; dips in interlayered gneisses become more variable than in undisturbed areas and culminate locally in a chaotic pattern; fissures and dikes increase in abundance as the fault is approached. These features, which on a lesser scale also are visible along secondary faults, including branches of the Ilse, are well displayed in the valley of Grape Creek be-
tween Bear Gulch and the Ilse fault (fig. 2). Segments
of rock between fissures exhibit sharp flexures and contortions of thin gneiss layers that must have been folded while the rock was plastic enough not to break.

Fissures in the disturbed zone may be transverse, oblique, or parallel to the main fault.
EXPOSURES AND OTH'ER EVIDENCE OF THE F,AULT
Nearly a century ago, the Terrible mine at Ilse, and prospects farther south, exposed the Ilse fault. Ore in the fault was cerussite, devoid of galena to the greatest depth of mining, about 750 feet (C. L. Beach1 , oral commun., 1955) ; this, despite galena at the surface in nearby veins, and a water table only about 50 feet deep, suggest that the cerussite may be hypogene. The opencut of the Terrible mine, now partly fill~d by water, remains the best exposure of the Ilse fault In the Wet Mountains. Geologic details are recorded by Emmons (1896, p. 468) and by Hunter (1915, p. 32). Briefly, the rocks involved in the fault at the Terrible mine lie between granitic gneiss walls that dip 60° westerly and comprise: (1) a western barren zone, 15. to 40 feet wide, of greenish-gray to blue soft, crumbly "diorite," green clayey material, and clay gouge, all of which are variably permeated by a yellow and brown stain; and (2) a "pay zone," 70 to 80 feet wid?, of crushed granitic rock "now altered beyond recognition, shattered into small lozenge-shaped fragments and stained by iron oxide" (Emmons, 1896, p. 468). Hunter (1915, p. 32) add that
For 2 miles south of the Terrible mine, the so-called cerusite [sic] zone can be followed almost continuously and ranges from a belt 80 feet in maximum width at this mine to a mere band of slightly altered and iron-stained gneiss only a few feet across. In several places -prospects reveal a narrow wne of intensely crushed rock consisting chiefly of clay gouge, feldspathic material, calcite, and chloritic micas with limonite and manganese stains. On either side of such a zone, which is rarely over 10 feet wide, the granite gneiss may be considerably altered, although as a rule it is but little crushed and grades into fresher rock.
The remarkable variations in thickness and intensity of crushing do not reflect a southward termination but are characteristic features of the fault.
Details about the fault 'between Ilse and locality 2 (fig. 2) have been learned from recently completed mapping in the Mount Tyndall quadrangle (M. R. Brock and Q. D. Singewald, unpub. data). Particularly noteworthy is a great difference in prevailing foliation attitudes of rocks on opposite sides of the fault, as shown on figure 2. A great difference in lithology also exists; hornblende gneiss predominates west of the fault, biotite gneiss and granite gneiss east of the fault. Along this 2112-mile stretch, the fault bends abruptly at 7 places, but only. at 4 of them is the angle large enough to be apparent on figure 2. Although exposed only at localities 1 and 2, the fault

·between Ilse and locality 2 can be located within an estimated 100 to 200 feet, owing in part, to its position at the upper edge of pediment benches along Oak Creek and, in part, to fairly numerous exposures of reddish feldspathized rock inferred to be in the eastern wall. An auxiliary fault that bends, or possibly even displaces, the Ilse fault at the south end of the Terrible mine, trends N. 50° W. Oak Creek follows this auxiliary fault for 2 miles, then wends its way back to the Ilse fault, at locality 3, where intensely fractured granite gneiss on the west tip of a gravelcovered bench is inferred to be in or adjacent to the Ilse fault.
Continuation of the Ilse fault northward from locality 3 to locality 5 beneath alluvium of Oak Creek is proved conclusively by marked divergence in attitudes of rocks. As shown on figure 2, the strike of the foliation is rather uniformly northwestward on the east side of the fault, and less uniform, yet prevailingly northeastward on the west side. At locality 4, two pits on a gravel-covered hill expose intensely sheared, altered hornblende gneiss dipping 70°-75° west, through which the Ilse fault is inferred to pass; at locality 5, the westernmost outcrops of virtually solid granite gneiss are inferred. to be very near the fault. Except at these localities, the valley of Oak

Creek is so broad that the trace of the fault generally can be located with an accuracy no greater than 0.20.25 mile.
Near locality 4, the Ilse fault bends 35° (fig. 2); if its trend from there to locality 5 continued northwestward, the fault would roughly coincide with the remarkably straight course of Bear Gulch. Moreover, the strike of interlayered gneisses along and near Bear Gulch is variable, yet prevailingly northwest. Analogous linear zones of northwest strikes, in mapped quadrangles to the south, are transverse to a regional northeast strike of gneisses west of the Ilse fault. These are regarded by the author as structural elements along which transverse displacement took place by rock flowage, as regional metamorphism waned and before the rocks became brittle. The Bear Gulch element probably absorbed a major share of the Ilse deformation, during at least the early stages of deformation, in this general area. The main Ilse zone, nevertheless, in this report as on the 1935 geologie map of Colorado is inferred to approximately follow, northward from locality 5, a lithologic boundary that also is a conspicuous topographic boundary between a high area of massive granite gneiss to the east and a lower area of fractured interlayered gneisses to the west. At locality 6, fracture and alteration along the

inferred lise fault are much less obvious than in a wide, radioctive shear zone that trends slightly east of north, about 0.1 mile to the west-northwest of locality 6.
The course of Grape Creek, where it approaches the lise fault, is deflected from northeast to northwest and opens from a narrow valley having nearly continuous exposures of bedrock into a wide valley in which unconsolidated material conceals most of the bedrock. Nearly 3 miles farther downstream (northwestward) , Grape Creek again curves northeastward through the northernmost trace of the lise fault-line scarp in a gorge so narrow and rocky as to be named "The Tights." The valley in the northern part of the northwest-flowing segment attains a width of 0.5 to 0.6 mile, because the stream itself flows away from the scarp at a small oblique angle along a zone of auxiliary fractures. Between the stream and the escarpment is a dissected pediment bench, where nonresistant, fractured and slumped, interlayered gneiss is covered at most places by unconsolidated debris.
At the northern part of the area of figure 2, uptilted Mesozoic rocks occupy the east wall of the lise fault. Although the fault was traced in this study only as far as shown on figure 2, it is known to continue northward, across the Arkansas River, as shown by the 1935 geologic map of Colorado. At locality 7, where the fault zone is wider than normal, alluvium covers

all sedimentary rocks except a ledge of limonite-
n'permeated, sericitized ( shattered, white quartzite.
Gneiss, to a distance of 500 feet west of the quartzite, is greatly altered and cut by breccia zones, dikes, and veins. At locality 8, whitish powdery soil in a low saddle reveals the approximate location of the fault at the southernmost point where the fault lies between Precambrian and. Mesozoic rocks.
Relations at localities 9, 10, and 11 prove that the fault at locality 8 continues southward in a nearly straight line at least a mile, with Precambrian rocks in both walls. The contact at localities 12 and 13 is an unconformity, and not a fault as shown on the 1935 geologic map of Colorado. At locality 9, a prospect pit exposes part of a zone of comminuted and bleached rocks, on opposite sides of which the attitudes of foliation differ. At locality 10 an opencut 75 feet long, transverse to the fault, exposes shattered and altered gneiss that has erratic dips, is transected by countless fissures, and contains an irregularly distributed radioactive vein substance; the radioactivity of local spots exceeds 5 milliroentgons per hour, the highest reading of the scintillation counter. This radioactive zone crops out at several places between localities 9 and 10, and it almost certainly connects beneath talus with a conspicuous zone of sheared and iron-stained gneisses, dikes, and veins at locality 11. By contrast, at localities 12 and 13, poorly bedded,

C24

S~RUCTURAL GEOLOGY

slightly friable conglomerate lies unconformably on Precambrian gneiss, with no fault between them. At each locality, several tens of feet of green fissile shale and then tan, massive-bedded sandstone are above the conglomerate. The fault close to locality 13 on figure 2 displaces the contact, but is not along it.
In the broad valley of Marsh Gulch, which is 0.1~ 0.2 mile wide south of locality 11, outcrops are rare. The major fault may logically be drawn through a small outcrop of pulverized rock in the east bank of Marsh Gulch at locality 14, and two outcrops of shattered and intensely altered rock 800 feet and 2,300 feet, respectively, farther upstream, but the fault is concealed elsewhere. Where alluvium becomes thin and discontinuous southward, along the divide between Marsh Gulch and Grape Creek, the lise fault should again become obvious, yet it does not. Conceivably, the major fault could (1) terminate· before reaching the divide between Marsh Gulch and Grape Creek, in which case the fault at locality 17 would be en echelon; (2) curve abruptly so as to pass first through locality 15, where a vein and dike zone trend N. 50° W., then through the saddle to the south, and finally down a rubble-filled ravine trending S. 5° E.; or (3) maintain a fairly straight course up Marsh Gulch, cross the divide 200 feet northeast of locali,ty 16 as a relatively inconspicuous zone of mildly fractured and stained granite gneiss cut by few dikes, and then continue to locality 17. The author prefers the third explanation, because variations in the intensity of cvushing are characteristic of the fault, as already mentioned.
Locality 17 is an outcrop ·of fissile, shattered, altered biotite gneiss in a gully wall; 200 feet upstream, radioactivity readings greater than the maximum recording range of the scintillometer were found on the dump of a mine in a vein nearly concordant with foliation in the east wall of the gully. The marked divergence in dips on opposite sides of the gully at locality 17 is proof of a major fault; presumably, the fault continues down the rubble-filled gully to Grape Creek.
RECAPITULATION
To sum up, incipient deYelopment of the lise fault may have begun before the Precambrian gneisses were

fully brittle; that is, while stress could be relieved more by folding, twisting, or stretching than by fracture. The concentration of excessive contortion, folding, and twisting-as represented by variable to chaotic dips unrelated to any specific faults-along transverse linear zones shows that deformation began to concentrate on the linear zones before the rocks were brittle enough to yield mainly by fracture. However, whatever may have been the date of its inception, the zone clearly antedates intrusion of Early Cambrian ( ~) dikes; otherwise, the dikes would not be more abundant along it than elsewhere. The ancestral fault transected the grain of its Precambrian rock wall. It is conceivable that at some places, zones such as the one along Bear Gulch, now regarded as a br~nch, absorbed as much of the Precambrian deformation as the main lise zone. The Paleozoic and Mesozoic history, after intrusion of the dikes, remain unknown. Renewed faulting on a major scale during Laramide, or later time, is shown by sharply uptilted and truncated Mesozoic rocks. At that time, the east wall moveq relatively downward. The Tevt.iary deformation need not have been uniform; in fact, variation in the extent of crushing along the f3iult, first noted by Hunter (1915, p. 32), suggests nonuniformity. The total picture, then, is one of an ancestral fault of variable width, intensity of deformation, and rock alteration, thrut localized Tertiary movement, which, in turn, was strong at some places and weak or absent at others.

Detection of the seismic velocities in the Straight

Because of the relationship of shear waves to dynamic elastic moduli, studies of the generation, transmission, and detection of shear waves in various rock types have been reported by numerous investigators. White and others (1956), White and Sengbush (1963), and Jolly (1956) have described field investigations concerned with the nature of shear-wave generation and methods of detection. Values of dynamic elastic moduli, under in situ conditions, using measurements of compressional and shear-wave velocity have been determined for granite (Nicholls, 1961) and salt (Dickey, 1964). The writers have measured compressional and shear-wave velocities in two different granites in an
attempt to determine the dynamic elastic properties

Creek tunnel was accomplished by mounting accelerometers in studs grouted in ¥2-inch-diameter holes drilled 1 inch into the granite rib (fig. 1A.). The useful range of these accelerometers was 3 to 3,500 cycles per second (c) with a resonant frequency of around 13 kilocycles per second (kc) and a sensitivity of approxi-
mately 8 millivolts per gravitational acceleration (mvI
g). Because these accelerometers have a very high internal impedance, 4-footcables were used to connect them to transistorized preamplifiers with variable gain (0.25 to 150). Low-pass (4-kc) filters were coupled to the preamplifiers, and outputs of the preamplifiers-filter pairs were fed to transistorized line drivers. The low output impedance of the latter enabled signals to be transmitted through cables several hundred feet long

the detectors were mounted at 2-foot intervals in plastic tubing which was inserted in 3-inch-diameter holes drilled 20 to 30 feet deep on the tunnel periphery. Contact between the accelerometers and the borehole walls was obtained by inflating a bicycle inner tube between the probe and the borehole wall (fig. 1B). Special 40-foot cables were used to connect the accelerometers in the probe to the preamplifiers at the hole collar.
For this arrangement, a 6-inch-deep shothole, % inch in diameter, was drilled near the collar of the instrument hole. Seismic energy was provided by a seismic blasting cap inserted in the shothole with water-soaked tissue used for stemming. In a few instances, when the accelerometers were positioned deep in the hole, the cap energy had to be supplemented by a small charge of dynamite wrapped in aluminum foil around the cap. Mostly, however, the single blasting cap yielded sufficient energy to obtain measurements throughout the length of the hole.
MEASUREMENTS IN THE STRAIGHT CREEK PILOT BORE
The granitic rock in which the Straight Creek pilot bore was driven is considered to be equivalent to the Precambrian Silver Plume Granite (Robinson and Lee, 1962). A section of quartz monzonite relatively free of fractures was selected for the initial measurements. A sample record obtained over the interval .indicated in figure 1A is shown in figure 2.
Consistent shear-wave generation with repeated shooting was not obtained even though numerous shothole orientations and loading conditions were tried. Although time limitations prevented the checking of alternative arrangements, it is tentatively concluded that the use of a water-filled hole with the charge detonated halfway in the hole is an effective means of generating a strong shear wave. Variations in the waveform character with repeated shots and the inability to consistently recognize a shear-wave arrival with repeated shots remains a problem. A recognizable shear-wave arrival on a number of records, however, allows elastic moduli to be calculated.
Table 1 lists values of dynamic moduli obtained at the Straight Creek site based on the standard formulas that relate these moduli (Dobrin, 1952, p. 181). A density of 2.67 grams per cubic centimeter which is the average density of 30 samples was used as a representative value for granitic rock in the calculations at both the Colorado and Nevada sites.

(Houser and Poole, 1960). In the tunnels of the Climax stock, measurements were obtained in quartz monzonite by the inhole method (fig. 1B). Sample records obtained at two locations in the quartz monzonite are shown in figure 3. As in the Straight Creek tunnel, shear waves were not generated consistently in a number of holes or even at different depths in the same hole. In areas of severe fracturing, shear waves were not detected by either the inhole method or the surface method.
The dynamic elastic constants calculated for the two locations in the tunnels in the Climax stock are listed in table 2. The total time (time break to each accelerometer) recorded at the shop-drift site (fig. 3) differs significantly from the interval time between detectors. This is because the shop-drift site exhibits low velocity layering on the tunnel periphery, owing to the enlargement of preexisting fractures in response to stress relief. Consequently, the velocities listed in table 2 for this hole represent the higher velocity layer behind the tunnel wall, and a velocity based on total time (time from shot instant at collar to last detector

should be approached with caution, however, because the seismic velocity of rock is a function of stress, which may differ ~n the two environments. Additional research is needed (1) to relate the magnitude· and direction of stress to relative changes in compressional and shear-wave velocities and (2) to determine the consequent effect on the dynamic elastic moduli.
·The techniques used in this investigation could not consistently generate shear waves. Results indicate that the environment of the energy source and the presence of fractures in the transmitting media are critical. Another approach that may enhance the detection of shear waves (not tried in this investigation) would be the use of three-component detectors.

RUPTURE PHENOMENA IN THE SILVER PLUME GRANITE, COLORADO By FITZHUGH T. LEE and THOMAS C. NICHOLS, JR., Denver, Colo.

A.bstmot.-Fractures, slickensides, and gouge produced .during laboratory compressive testing of .cylinders of Silver Plume Granite resemble fractures noted in the granite during surface and subsurface mapping in the Straight Creek area, Colorado. Formation of gouge and slick~nsides in the laboratory is believed to be due primarily to energy release rather than to movement. 1!...,ault displacements in granitic terrane should be examined in the light of these findings.
A rock mechanics study of the Precambrian Silver Plume Granite has been undertaken in connection with a comprehensive geological and geophysical research program being conducted in the pilot b01·e of the Straight Creek Tunnel, 55 miles west of Denver, Colo. (fig. 1). The ultimate objective of these laboratory tests is the application of the results to engineering problems in surface and subsurface excavations.
Similarities· were noted between slickensides and gouge produced in core samples before or during compressive failure and natural slickensides and gouge. These laboratory-produced features may shed new light on field criteria for recognition of faulting, as well as on determination of amount of displacement along faults. For example, Nevin (1949, p. 134) states that if other variables are equal, the amount of shattering and the thickness of associated breccia are proportional to the n,mount of displacement on a fault. It is generally assumed that slickensides and gouge are produced only by differential grinding movement along the two sides of a fault. IIowever, these features can also be produced by internal strain adjustments in response to C'ompressive forces.
The Silver Plume Granite was selected for an investigation of rock mechanics because it has been extensively studied in connection with the construction of the Straight Creek Tunnel pilot bore, and because samples could be selected from here that are relatively uniform in composition, structure, and fabric. According to Robinson and Lee (1962, 1965) the granite varies considerably in composition, principally as a result of partial to complete assimilation of metasedimentary rocks. Where uncontaminated, the rock

is a quartz monzonite rather than a true granite.. The

granite is light gray to light pinkish gr~y ~nd fine to

ROCK MECHAN:I'CS

FRACTURES IN THE SILVER PLUME GRANITE
Rocks of the Straight Creek area are shattered along the southern part of the Berthoud Pass fault (Lovering and Goddard, 1950, p. 59-60), which is a northto northeast-trending zone, about 2 miles wide, in which diversely oriented bodies of faulted and sheared rock are separated by relatively unfractured rock. According to Lovering and Goddard (1950, p. 79), episodes of shearing took place in Precambrian time and also in Late Cretaceous and Tertiary time.
In the pilot bore of the tunnel the Silver Plume Granite is sheared and altered in varying degrees. Contacts of shear zones are gradational-the intensity of shearing decreases outward from the center of the zone. Near the margins of the shear zones, the rock is broken into slivers 0.1 foot wide bounded by slickensided shear planes. Grooves 2 feet or more in length are also present. Much of the sheared surface is covered with clay gouge and broken feldspar and quartz grains. Figure 2 shows a closer view of a slickensided granite sample from th~ pilot bore. Microscopic examination indicates that grain fracturing, and commonly the shearing as well, extends entirely through some of the blocks. Where shearing was intense, the rock has been reduced to a coarse to fine sand, and the shear planes are from less than 0.01 foot to 0.1 foot apart and are oriented in many directions. In areas of most intense shearing the material is fault gouge consisting of clay with varying amounts of fine-grained feldspar, ·mica, and quartz grains. The fault gouge commonly shows some chemical alteration.
Many joints in the pilot bore are actually microfaults and shears (Robinson and Lee, 1965, p. 19).
FIGURE 2.-Sample of Silver Plume Granite from wall of Straight Creek Tunnel pilot bore, showing slickensided surface (s), mullion structure (m), and clay gouge (g). Note similar features in figure 5.

Such joints typically are coated with biotite or chlorite and commonly are slickensided. The rock immediately adjacent to the joint is partially altered for a distance of 0.01 foot to 0.1 foot inward from the joint. Other joint surfaces are coated with calcite, dolomite, selenite, talc, or epidote. Locally, quartz coats the joint surfaces, and is commonly slickensided. A few tight uncoated joints are also present.
LABORATORY RESULTS
The laboratory investigation of the Silver Plume Granite included both triaxial and unconfined compressive tests. Pressures ranged from atmospheric (unconfined) to 5,000 pounds per square inch (confined). Compressive strengths ranged from 15,000 to 65,700 psi. Thirty cylindrical cores were tested which had an average length of 4.01 inches and an average diameter of 1.99 inches. Figure 3 shows a typical core after failure. The test procedures and equipment are discussed elsewhere (Nichols and Lee, 1966). The core in figure 3 failed under a compressive stress of 65,700 psi and a confining pressure of 5,000 psi. The main failure surface forms an angle of 25°-35° with the vertical axis.
.As the confined cores approached failure under compression, the middle of the cylinder bulged; this was reflected by an increase in the ratio of the radial strain to the longitudinal strain. In order to better understand the mechanics of deformation and failure, an accelerometer was fitted in a base platen (fig. 3) to detect seismic disturbances during axial and lateral loading. A recording oscillograph provided a photographic record of energy-producing events during loading (fig. 4) . It is noteworthy that minor amounts of energy were released several minutes before failure, during which the rate of loading was about 60 psi per second. Megascopic and microscopic examination of features noted in cores which failed and in cores removed prior to failure suggests that the energyproducing events recorded may have been caused by grain dislocations and fractures (both shear and tensile) during the lateral bulging. Increase of the axial load eventually resulted in complete failure of the rock sample, during which a sudden large release of energy occurred, accompanied by a loud explosion and simultaneous breaking of the core. Inasmuch as gouge was found in cores removed before failure, some of the events from t = - 3.5 seconds to t=O second (fig. 4), and perhaps earlier, may be associated with rupture phenomena which produce gouge and slickensides before shear movement occurs.

size gouge consisting of crushed quartz, feldspar, and biotite or chlorite grains. The maximum relative displacement measured along the dip of the ruptured zone is about 0.25 inch. The displacement is the amount of offset bebveen reference lines marked on the core. The vinyl membrane has a negligible influence on displacement because of the high fluid confining pressure. Continuous slickensides on the surface of failure (fig. 5) are as long as 2 inches. Relative displacements are as long as 2 inches. Relative displacements are consistently about one order of magnitude less than observed slickenside length. The surfaces shown in figure 5 have coatings of "fault gouge" that consist of clay- to sand-sized particles. Other cores show continuous grooves as much as 4 inches long.
X-ray examination of the gouge found along faults in the Silver Plume Granite shows montmorillonite, kaolinite, and illite to be present, whereas the gouge produced in cores in the laboratory lacks montmorillonite and illite and has onJy a minor amount of kaolinite. This indicates that much of the gouge found in the pilot bore is the result of post-faulting alteration, perhaps caused by ground water, since the presence of clay minerals would not be anticipated in gouge material produced from dry, unaltered granite.
The "fault gouge" from the laboratory tests was carefully removed from the failure surfaces and weighed and compared with the original weight of the core to determine the percentage of "fault gouge." The amount of fresh rock reduced to clay size and fine sand ranged from less than 1 percent to about 3 percent (by weight) of the original core. The actual percentage was considerably higher in some instances in which observable gouge could not be collected from internal surfaces without causing abnormal breakage. In general, greater confining pressures caused the production of greater amounts of fine-grained material.

CONCLUSIONS
The writers are as yet unable to provide a wholly adequate explanation of all the fracture phenomena described above. In general, they concur with the ideas of brittle crack growth during compression expressed by Brace and Bombolakis (1963), who believe that many faults may be formed by the interaction of en echelon arrays of cracks which are present before displacement along a fault. Brace and Bombolakis also point out that the applied stress necessary to start growth of cracks in brittle material is less than the stress required to produce ultimate macroscopic fracture; and, in at least a few cases, the stress required to produce macroscopic fractures is considerably less than the stress necessary to cause failure by faulting.

2. Maximum relative movement of adjacent displaced pieces of core is at least one order of magnitude less than the length of observed slickensides.
3. In laboratory tests, more than 3 percent by weight

of some samples of fresh granite is converted to clay-, silt-, and sand-sized material along surfaces of rupture. 4.

PRELIMINARY APPRAISAL OF APPLIED ROCK MECHANICS RESEARCH ON SILVER PLUME GRANITE, COLORADO
By THOMAS C. NICHOLS, JR., and FITZHUGH T. LEE, Denver, Colo.

Ab3traot.-A program of preliminary laboratory testing was conducted to determine elastic and physical properties of the Silver Plume Granite and certain types of rock associated with it. Data derived from laboratory tests were used to relate deformation to the structure, fabric, and mineralogy of the rock. Results of this investigation show: (1) how structural features such as strong lineations, foliations, joints, faults, and associated mineralogic variations are related to the deformation and failure of granitic rocks, and (2) how the knowledge of the physical behavior of a rock determined in the laboratory is significant to the engineer when it can be related to the behavior of the rock in the field.

Laboratory testing was conducted on a relatively

undeformed, uniform rock of medium grain size, the

Silver Plume Granite, to determine deformational and

strength properties under various conditions. Infor-

mation obtained from these tests was compared to

structure, fabric, and mineralogy of the rock in an

attempt to isolate factors related to deformation and

strength. An attempt was also made to relate defor-

mational phenomena observed in the laboratory to

similar geologic phenomena observed in the field.

The Precambrian Silver Plume Granite specimens

used for testing were relatively massive and of fairly

uniform mineralogy and grain size. The granite has

been described by Harrison and Wells (1959, p. 17-

20). The specimens used for these tests contain

medium-sized randomly oriented grains of quartz, feld-

spar, biotite, and muscovite, with a few large grains

of feldspar that give a slightly porphyritic texture.

Foliation of feldspar is faintly discernible. Individual

mineral grains have microscopic and macroscopic frac-

tures of apparent random orientation, although some

apparent fractures are cleavages and grain interfaces.

Samples for testing were obtained from an abandoned

quarry near Silver Plume, Colo.

·

METHODS OF STUDY
Laboratory tests consisted of measurements of triaxial compression, unconfined compression, and ten-

sile strength, from which stress, strain, and seismic data were obtained at various stages of deformation.
All samples were prepared in the manner described below:

1. Samples not already existing as cores were cut with a 21fs-inch core barrel.

2. Cores were trimmed and planed such that the

length-to-diameter ratio was at least 2: 1. The end parallelism was held to a tolerance of less than 0.001 inch. Orientation of foliation and planes of weakness were recorded. Samples for

the tensile tests were trimmed to the size of the apparatus. Parallelism of the ends of these samples is unimportant.

3. For triaxial compression tests, strain gages were

applied to the surface of each core midway be-

tween the top and bottom. Two rosette gages,

each with two 90° components, were applied, one

component being parallel and the other perpen-

dicular to the long axis. The gages were mounted

on opposite sides of the core with the parallel

components connected in series to obtain average

strain measurements. Radial strain was deter-

mined by comparing the ratio of the change in

circumference (!::..0) to the original circumference

(0), or conversely the ratio of the change in

radius (t::..R) to the original radius (R). It can be

shown

t::..O
that 0 =

tR::..R

or

that

circumferential

strain is equal to radial strain. Thus, radial strain was measured directly by circumferentially

mounted strain gages. Axial strain was Ineasured by gages mounted parallel to the long axis.

The cores for triaxial testing were covered with tough membranes of polyvinyl chloride (fig. 1) and

placed between loading platens in a triaxial chamber capable of transmitting axial loads of 400,000 pounds and holding fluid pressures of 8,000 pounds per square inch. An accelerometer was mounted on the bottom

chamber, after being filled with hydraulic fluid and sealed, was placed in a hydraulic press capable of exerting loads up to 400,000 pounds at uniform loading rates. Electrical connections necessary for monitoring strain measurements and accelerometer impulses were then completed. A strain indicator was used to measure strain, and an oscillograph was used to monitor accelerometer impulses. A diagrammatic sketch, figure 2, shows the entire loading and monitoring system.

Types of tests

Triaxial loading tests were performed on the core

to investigate the following:

1. The effect of increased confining pressures upon

the elastic and physical properties of the samples.

2. The differences between physical measurements

that can be expected within the Silver Plume

Granite.

3. The applicability of Mohr's failure envelope in

predicting strength and internal friction for var-

ious degrees of confining stress.

4. The probability and amount of creep under con-

fining pressures.

samples during stress applications.

Unc'dnfined con1pression tests and tensile tests were conducted on duplicate samples, primarily to correlate these test observations with triaxial test observatro~ls, and to provide data for Mohr's failure envelopes. ·.The unconfined compression tests were performed by1oading cores axially until they failed. No. attempt was made to induce permanent set in the cores by preliminary repeated loading. Strain measurements were made with calibrated mechanical extensometers.
The tensile tests were conducted on apparatus designed by Donald R. Reichmuth/ utilizing a pointloading method. Strain was not measured in these tests.
RESULTS O·F INVESTIGATIONS
Compressive strength
The compressive strength of the Silver Plume Granite is quite high under all conditions of orientation and loading. The unconfined compressive strength ranges from 22,000 to 33,000 psi. Confining pressures ranging from 0 to 5,000 psi were applied to various cores of similar composition placed in different orientations with respect to foliation. As the confining pressures increased, the strength of the rocks also increased. At 5,000 psi some specimens of Silver Plume Granite reached a strength of 65,000 psi. The strengths and internal angles of friction under different confining pressures and core orientations were predictable in most instances using Mohr's failureenvelope plots (Sowers and Sowers, 1951, p. 42-44) (fig. 3) . As suspected, the weak foliation in these cores had very little effect upon the strength. All test curves that were plotted, with the exception of curves 4 and 6, fit very closely to the failure envelope. The deviation of curves 4 and 6 can be explained by a probable decrease of cohesion or internal friction within the cores tested.
Effect of mineral co.ntent and foliation on strength
To show the effect of mineral content upon the strength of the Silver Plume Granite, several cores were chosen that had a greater deviation of mineral content than those used for the Mohr's envelope plot. These cores were tested under identical confining pressures of 1,500 psi at similar orientations; their strength varies only slightly with composition change (fig. 4). With the exception of one apparently anomalous core that failed at 60,300 psi, core failure values are in a very narrow range. Thus, it appears that the incipient

pressive stress values. Also, the compressive strengths of these rocks changed with variations in mineralogy; as the biotite or quartz content increased, the strength lessened. In such rocks, Mohr's failure envelope could not be used with any great success to predict ultimate strengths of the rocks or their angles of internal friction.
Elastic behavior
When the Silver Plume Granite was subjected to confining pressures of 0 to 5,000 psi during testing, a brittle elastic behavior was observed. Very little ductility was noticed, and the elastic behavior was seen to be very uniform, as described below.
In similar tests on Silver Plume Granite samples oriented in several different directions, the ratio of axial stress to axial strain varied a maximum of +6 percent from the mean value. The mean value for the stress-strain ratio was approximately 7X 106 psi for unconfined tests and approximately 8.6 X 106 psi for tests in which the confining pressures ranged from 1,500 to 5,000 psi. Thus, there was an initial increase of the stress-strain ratio when the confining pressure was changed from 0 to 1,500 psi, but no significant change as the con.fining stress was increased from 1,500 to 5,000 psi.
The ratios of radial strain to axial strain were consistently very close on samples of the Silver Plume Granite tested under similar conditions. In general, these ratios increased as the axial stress was increased, but decreased as the confining stress was increased. Cores that were repeatedly preloaded by axial and hydrostatic stresses had decreased radial- to axialstrain ratios. Also, permanent set was developed, the greatest amount occurring during the first preload.
Different conditions of repeated preloading of these specimens appear to uniquely change the elastic behavior of the samples. Although definite conclusions cannot be drawn from the limited data available, the following observations were made: 1. Those cores that were axially preloaded showed :
a. permanent set primarily parallel to the axis of the specimen.
b. a linear stress to axial-strain ratio. c. a nonlinear stress to radial-strain ratio. The
change of stress generally did not increase as rapidly as the change of radial strain. 2. Those cores that were hydrostatically preloaded showed: a. permanent set of similar magnitude both in the axial and radial directions. b. a linear stress to axial-strain ratio that orren-

erally is greater than the stress to strain ratio of axially preloaded cores. c. a nearly linear stress to radial-strain ratio.

Creep

Creep under confining pressures of as much as 5,000

psi is probably negligible within the Silver Plume

Granite. Tests show that when a granite sample is

loaded to 5,000 psi confining pressure and 51,000 psi

axial stress for 3 days, the rate of creep slows to (1)

approximately 25 microinches per inch per day on the

second day and (2) to 15 microinches per inch per day

on the third day. Yet, the amount of strain caused
ocby a 1 change in temperature is about 8 microinches

per inch. Thus, creep apparently becomes negligible

after stress has been applied for several days, after

which small strain caused by temperature fluctuations

will be dominant.

·

Fabric changes
There was an initial attempt to make quantitative fabric measurements for this investigation, but because of excessive time required for these Ineasurements it was felt that the following qualitative observations of gross features would suffiice for these preliminary investigations.
Immediately before and after failure of core samples there is a substantial increase of fracture density along many zones subparallel to or at conjugate angles to the main rupture zone. In all instances this fracturing took place along planes of high shear stress. Some of these zones of intense fracturing did not completely propagate through the cores, indicating that shear failure is not an instantaneous occurrence. Energy release, recorded as the specimens were loaded, indicated that small local failures along fractures took place at a uniform rate throughout the duration of the test until complete failure occurred. At the time of complete failure a very large amount of energy is released. This indicates that fracture density probably increased along planes of high shearing stress throughout the· duration of the test and that movement along these planes possibly occurred before tota.l failure. The failure planes had slickensides and welldeveloped gouge similar to that observed in the field along faults and fractures (Lee and Nichols, 1966).

APPLICATION OF TEST R·ESULTS
The strength of the different rocks tested is great. Therefore, significant engineering problems in this terrane most likely will be related to faults, gouge zones, joints, strong lineations, and foliations rather than to the inherent strength of the rocks themselves.

C38

ROCK MECHA.N:lCS

The Mohr failure-envelope plots indicate that a uniform granite such as the Silver Plume has remarkably uniform strength and internal friction properties, which could be used to help solve structural problems in the field. For example, if the attitudes of shear fractures are measured in the field on similar rocks whose stress history is not known, then angles of friction computed from stress analyses in the laboratory might help define conjugate sets of shear joints. Such local information could be valuable in analyzing regional tectonic systems when used in conjunction with more sophisticated methods such · as those. described by Brace (1961) and Harrison and Moench (1961).
The knowledge of elastic behavior of the Silver Plume Granite gained from laboratory studies is probably not of any great value in itself without additional field information. In situ measurements using geophysical techniques to determine the elastic behavior before, during, and after disturbances caused by engineering construction are probably more meaningful. By comparing the elastic behavior of rocks measured in situ with the behavior of similar rocks tested in the laboratory it may be possible to study (1) the magnitude and nature of stress redistributions caused by engineering disturbances, and (2) the relation of these redistributions to existing geologic structures.
To corroborate these interpretations of elastic behavior, scale models simulating geologic structures should be made in the laboratory with built-in monitoring devices capable of sensing stress and temper-

ature changes and microseisms. Similar devices should be used in the field. These laboratory models can be stressed to simulate the disturbances caused in the field by construction practices. Data obtained from these tests can then be compared with field data in an attempt to determine the effects of structural features upon stress behavior.
CONCLUSIONS
In general, preliminary laboratory testing of the Silver Plume Granite has helped explain the behavior of this rock under certain stress conditions. More importantly, the test data have a practical application to engineering construction problems, and have provided a basis for planning future testing. Clearly, field measurements of rock behavior are needed in conjunction with future laboratory studies.

STRATIGRAPHY, PALEONTOLOGY, AND ISOTOPIC AGES OF UPPER MESOZOIC ROCKS IN THE SOUTHWESTERN WRANGELL MOUNTAINS, ALASKA
By ARTHUR GRANTZ, D. L. JONES, and M. A. LANPHERE,
Menlo Park, Calif.

A.hstraot.-Reconnaissance field observations, fossils, and potassium-argon ages have provided new information on the upper Mesozoic strata of the Wrangell Mountains. The Kotsina Conglomerate is probably Middle or lower Upper Jurassic. Sandstone along the Chetaslina River may be Callovian (Jurassic), and nearby unfossiliferous shale and sandstone is probably also upper Mesozoic. A unit of sandstone,. siltstone, conglomerate, and calcarenite, previously thought to be gradatwnal downward into the Kotsina Conglomerate, yielded Hauterivian and Barremian .(Lower Cretaceous) fossils. Similar rocks occur in the northern Chugach Mountains and at Kuskulana Pass, where they rest on granodiorite dated as 141±5 m.y. Sandstone and siltstone with Albian (Lower Cretaceous) fossils rest on the Hauterivian to Barremian rocks at Kuskulana Pass, and shale and arkose of similar age rest on granodiorite dated as 126±4 m.y. near Mount Drum.

In addition, Mendenhn.ll (1905) mapped unaltered sedimentary rocks which he thought were Tertiary, in the Cheshnina, Chet:tslina, and Dadina River drainage areas, but these rocks are now known to be upper Mesozoic. Near the mouth of the Chitina River, ~1offit (1914) :found two units of supposed ~1iddle Jurassic age, a unit of "tuffaceous slate" overlying a "tuffaceous conglomerate".

In the Kotsina-J(uskulana Rivers district, Moffit and Mertie (1923) recognized three units of upper Mesozoic rocks to which they assigned a Late Jurassic age. The lowest unit is the J(otsina Conglomerate which unconformably overlies Upper Triassic shale and consists of massive conglomerate with r~re shale lenses. The J(otsina was thought to be overlain by an unnamed unit of sandstone, conglomerate, and shale, and this in turn by an unnamed light-colored, highly fossiliferous limestone unit. Moffit and ~1m·tie did not retain the name J(ennicott Formation for the upper two units.
The sporadic distribution of these three units, and the fact that in no place were the upper two found in

PALEONTOLOGY AND STRATrGRAPHY

stratigraphic sequence with the Kotsina Conglomerate, led to uncertainty as to their relationships. The massive Kotsina Conglomerate was thought to grade laterally into soft yellowish-brown fossiliferous sandstone of the middle unit to the north. The lack of thick conglomerate in some places between the upper limestone unit and the Triassic formations, however, suggested that either the Kotsina was deposited in a restricted area, or that it was removed by erosion prior to deposition of the limestone.
Moffit (1938) published a summary of the geology of the entire Chitina Valley and adjacent area, but the relationships of the upper Mesozoic rocks of the Kotsina-Kuskulana Rivers area and nearby areas to those in other parts of the region were puzzling; they could not be correlated either lithologically or faunally with any other known sequence. Likewise, the supposed Middle Jurassic tuffaceous beds exposed near the mouth of the Chitina River could not be correlated with any others within the Chitina Valley region.
Imlay and Reeside (1954, p. 231) correlated the Kotsina Conglomerate with the basal part of the Matanuska Formation of supposed Coniacian (Late Cretaceous) age. The fossiliferous limestone was not mentioned and presumably was also regarded as part of the Matanuska Formation. They also assigned an Albian (Late Cretaceous) age to the Kennicott Formation, which crops out eastward from Kuskulana Pass, at the east margin of the present study area.

PRESENT INVESTIGATIONS
This report is based on 9 days of helicopter-supported fieldwork carried out by Grantz in the summer of 1963, and contains the results of paleontologic studies by Jones and isotopic age measurements by Lanphere. An abstract of the data resulting from this collaborative work has been published previously (Grantz and others, 1965) . Geologic observations were made throughout an area of about 1,200 square miles, but time did not permit tracing contacts or thorough examination of all exposures.
It is assumed that the potassium-argon ages discussed are at least minimum ages, because there is no evidence that biotite or hornblende from granitic rocks incorporate significant amounts of radiogenic argon at the time of crystallization. The plus-or-minus value assigned to each age (table 1) is the estimated standard deviation of analytical precision.
Where possible the formations discussed below will be correlated with the standard stages of northwestern Europe ; a list of these stages for the Upper Jurassic and Cretaceous is presented in table 2.

The Kotsina Conglomerate, named by Rohn (1900, p. 431) for exposures on and near the Kotsina River, also crops out near the headwaters of Strelna Creek,

and was founrl on the north side of the Cheshnina River valley during the present study (fig. 2).
The physiographic expression of the formation was aptly described by Moffit and Mertie (1923, p. 45) who noted that "The conglomerate mountains are rugged, with precipitous cliffs and a ragged skyline. Their dark color and rough surface give them a forbidding aspect, and in fact many of the ridges are practically impassable." The l{otsina is a very thick bedded, well-rounded, pebble-and-cobble conglomerate that contains boulders in some beds. Hand specimens are prevailingly dark or olive gray. The matrix is lithic or feldspathic sandstone which is poorly to fairly well sorted, or in some places dark, hard lutite. The formation contains interbeds and lenses of similar sandstone and of black lutite that commonly is carbonaceous and contains plant scraps. Some of the interbeds are tens of feet thick. The conglomerate clasts are principally dark rocks and of local origin, mostly altered volcanic rocks and ·Triassic limestone, argillite, and chert. Some light-colored and some mafic plutonic rocks, sandstone, and a little quartz
are also present. The size of the clasts appears to decrease toward the southeast. The l{otsina Conglo-
merate rests unconformably upon rocks as young as latest Triassic. It is probably at least 2,000 to 2,500

feet thick, but its upper contact has not been recognized, and its full thickness· is not known. Its estimated thickness and coarseness of grain size suggest that the Kotsina Conglomerate was. deposited in a fault- or flexure-bounded basin, probably on or near shore.
The only fossils .found in the Kotsina Conglomerate are plant scraps in the lutite layers and Late Triassic mollusks in limestone clasts. Earlier workers based its age upon mollusks found in supposedly equivalent or gradationally overlying marine clastic rocks now known to be of late Neocomian Early Cretaceous (Hauterivian) age. These fossiliferous rocks are unrelated to the l{otsina Conglomerate, and in fact could not be found in contact with it. The supposedly equivalent rocks have been variously considered to be Late Jurassic, Jurassic or Cretaceous, Early Cretaceous, or Late Cretaceous, and the age of the Kotsina Conglomerate varied with the age assigned to these beds.
The Kotsina Conglomerate is intruded by porphyritic hornblende microdiorite dikes that cut a postl{otsina fault north of the l{otsina River (locality H~ fig. 2) and are themselves unconformably overlain by beds of Hauterivian age. These relations are shown on figure 3. Assuming that a significant period of time was required to fault the l{otsina Conglomerate, intrude the dikes, erode the rocks on the west side of the fault to the level of the dikes, and then to submerge the area to receive the Hauterivian sediments, then a Jurassic age for the l{otsina Conglomerate seems likely.
Support for, and considerable refinement of, the stratigraphic age of the Kotsina Conglomerate is

·PALE-ONTOLOGY AND STRATIGRAPHY

provided by potassium-argon ages determined for hornblende in one of the microdiorite dikes (sample 2, table 1) which cut the conglomerate and in a biotite grandiorite clast (sample 1, table 1) from the conglomerate in the same outcrop. The age determined for hornblende from the dike is 142+5 million years, and that for biotite from the clast is 157+6 m.y. These determinations indicate a minimum age of Late Jurassic and suggest a Middle or Late Jurassic age for the Kotsina Conglomerate. The biotite age is in good agreement with potassium-argon ages of biotite and hornblende from plutons in the Talkeetna Mountains (Grantz and others,, 1963) and the Aleutian Range (Detterman and others, 1965). The stratigraphic evidence in these two areas suggests that emplacement of these plutons occurred in latest Early to earliest Middle Jurassic time. The biotite age for the Kotsina Conglomerate clast suggests that the plutonism which was widespread in the area of the Matanuska geosyncline also occurred locally in the area of the I\::otsina Conglomerate.
An age of 141+5 m.y. (sample 3, table 1) was determined for hornblende from a granodiorite pluton near Kuskulana Pass (loc. E, fig. 2). This pluton intrudes latest Triassic rocks and is overlain unconformably by Lower Cretaceous (Hauterivian) rocks. Its indicated age is significantly less than the ages that have been measured for granitic rocks in the Talkeetna Mountains and Aleutian Range, which were noted above.
The ages of the hornblende from the pluton at Kuskulana Pass and from the dike which intrudes the Kotsina Conglomerate north of the Kotsina River (samples 2 and 3, table 1) are, however, in excellent agreement, and are considered to represent a Late .Jurassic plutonic episode.
Sandstone and lutite
Other rocks in the southwestern Wrangell Mountains that may be Jurassic crop out in the bluffs along the Chetaslina and Cheshnina .Rivers (fig. 2). These rocks consist mostly of sandstone and lutite and dip 25° to 30° SW. The outcrops along the Cheshnina River lie downdip from nearby outcrops of the Kotsina Conglomerate which they resemble more closely in degree of induration and deformation than they do the Cretaceous rocks of the area.
The most abundant rock type is greenish-gray, thickbedded :feldspathic and lithic graywacke that is loca1ly crossbedded and calcareous. It ranges from finegrained to very coarse grained and pebbly sandstone with angular to subroundecl grains that are· generally poorly sorted. The sandstone contains many interbeds and units of pebble-and-cobble conglomerate, dark-gray

siltstone, and mudstone intraclasts. Most of the conglomerate clasts are volcanic rock :fragments, hut some are granitic, and others are sandstone or limestone. Plant scraps and a few marine fossils have been found in the sandstone and its siltstone interbeds.
Downstream from the main sandstone outcrops on the Cheshnina River, and possibly overlying them, are green to gray lutites with thin sandstone interbeds at some places. These interbeds of sandstone are dark greenish gray and fine grained, and they locally have graded bedding and sole markings. Apparently the stratigraphically highest rocks are shaly and silty claystone and siltstone that contain brownish grayweathering limestone interbeds and concretions.
The sandstone beds are estimated to be more than 1,000 feet, and are possibly more than 2,000 feet thick. Neither the top nor the base of the section is exposed. The lutites are at least several hundred feet thick, but in places they are. in tight southeast-striking isoclinal and chevron folds, and their thickness could not be determined during the present reconnaissance.
These rocks were mapped as nonmarine and of Tertiary age by others (Moffit, 1939, pl. 2; Mendenhall, 1905, pl. 4). During the present studies, however, a belemnite and Inoceramus scraps were found in sandstone on the Chetaslina River, and several small pelecypods and small ammonites in outcrops on the Cheshnina River. Ralph W. Imlay., of the U.S. Geological Survey, states (written commun., 1963) that although the ammonites cannot be positively identified, they resemble immature forms of K epplerites, or some related genus, of Callovian age, and that an early Late J urasic age seems probable.
CRETACEOUS ROCKS
Clastic rocks of Early Cretaceous (Neocomian) age
Marine sedimentary rocks of Neocomia.n age form many small mountaintop outcrops between Long Glacier and l{uskulana Valley and constitute a larger area of continuous exposures near Kuskulana Pass (fig. 2). Correlative beds previously referred to as the tuffaceous units of 1\{iddle Jurassic ·age crop out south of the Chitina River in the northern Chugach Mountains. Moffit and 1\{ertie (1923) described the Neocomian beds in some detail but were puzzled by their stratigraphic complexity and age and their relation to the J(otsina Conglomerate. Indeed, mollusks from these beds have been assigned by various paleontologists to the Middle .Jurassic, Late Jurassic, Early Cretaceous, and Late Cretaceous (Moffit and Mertie, p. 44-48; Moffit, 1938, p. 66-70; Imlay and Reeside, 1954, p. 231).

GRAN'l'Z, JONES, AND LANPHERE

C45

The Neocomian beds are much less deformed than the latest Triassic and older rocks upon which they rest with angular unconformity, and near J{uskulana Pass (loc. E, fig. 2) they overlie granodiorite for which a potassium-argon age of 141+5 m.y. was obtained on hornblende (sample 3, ta;ble 1). They are overlain, apparently unconformably, by beds of Albian age.
The Neocomian rocks are clastic marine deposits, but they are characterized by an almost white calcarenite facies which is composed of finely comminuted prisms of Inoceramius shell. Sandstone beds with lower proportions of biogenic calcite grains are brownish gray, greenish gray, or olive gray. North of the Chitina River these rocks are mostly fossiliferous, cross-bedded, calcareous sandstone and conglomerate. The thickest sections are from 600 to almost 1,000 feet thick. The sandstone and conglomerate intertongue greatly, and the stratigraphic sections differ widely from place to place (see Neocomian columnar sections, fig. 2). As with the nearby J{otsina Conglomerate, the conglomerate and sandstone clasts are chiefly greenstone, limestone, and argillite, and were derived from the subjacent formations. These rocks are nearshore, high-energy, shallow-water deposits.
North of the Chitina River, from 0 to 200 feet of rounded cobble-and-boulder conglomerate with a calcareous matrix, and in places containing many mollusks, occurs at the base of the Neocomian sequence. In the section north of the J{otsina River (loc. B, fig. 2) beds overlying the basal conglomerate are at least 600 feet thick. The lower 200-300 feet consist of calcareous sandstone that is fine to coarse grained and conglomeratic. The sandstone is fossiliferous, crossbedded, and contains beds and lenses of calcarenite and of coquinoid sandstone. It in turn is overlain by a similar thickness of medium-dark and greenishgray sn,ndy siltstone with 1nany, commonly large, mollusks. The upper part of the section consists of fossiliferous coarse sandstone, conglomerate, and calcarenite. At one place, about 60 feet of sandstone and conglomerate at the base of the upper coarse clastic rocks is overlain by about 50 feet of thick-bedded, very light gray (almost white), generally fine grained calcarenite with large InO<J.e?•anvus shell fragments and
some lenses of terrigenous pebbles and sand. The calcarenite section is overlain by a small thickness of
incompletely exposed calcareous sandstone. Within one large outcrop the calcarenite interfingers with calcareous conglomerate, and it is evidently supplanted
by fossiliferous calcareous sandstone and conglomerate within a quarter of a mile to the west. At one place
the basal 5 feet of the calcarenite interfingers with pebble conglomerate and lenses out within a horizon-

tal distance of 6 to 8 feet. The calcarenite may represent a nearshore bar or bank of wave-comminuted shell fragments which abutted an a.rea in which terrigenous detritus was being deposited in shallow water from a nearby stream mouth.
Correlative Neocomian beds in the northern Chugach Mountains south of the Chitina River and near its mouth (locs. 0 and D, fig. 2), are grossly similar in lithology to those north of the river. They are thicker, however, and include a thick unit of dark siltstone. Moffit (1914, p. 25-27) reported that these Neocomian rocks (loc. 0, fig. 2) south of the Chitina River (which he considered Middle Jurassic) consisted of (1) a lower unit at least 500-600 feet thick composed of massive conglomerate with rounded pebbles and cobbles of argillite, diorite, greenstone, and quartz, set in a tuffaceous matrix, and (2) an upper unit several hundred feet thick of fossiliferous tuffaceous beds "... composed of dark fine-grained sandstone-like rock, slightly calcareous, and showing numerous small flakes of mica on the cleavage surface." Moffit mapped the upper unit as tuffaceous slate (1914, pl. 2), and tuffaceous shale (1938, pl. 2). He stated that the conglomerate appeared to rest unconformably upon Carboniferous ( ?) schist, but that the contact was poorly exposed and at many places appeared to be a fault. Moffit's description of these rocks suggests that they are calcareous conglomerate and siltstone lithologically like the Neocomian clastic rocks north of the Chitina River. However, three fossil collections from the upper unit were studied by T. W. Stanton (Moffit, 1914, p. 26), who referred them to the ~1iddle Jurassic. These collections were reexamined during the present study and found to consist of fragmentary mollusks that could be either Jurassic or Cretaceous and that would not be out of place in the Hauterivian faunule collected from similar rocks about a mile to the east during the present study.
During the present ·reconnaissance the Neocomian rocks south of the Chitina River were examined only in a small stream at the east end of their outcrop area (loc. D, fig. 2) and their relationship to the rocks described by Moffit was not determined. Along this
stream more than 800 feet of dark, fairly hard, fossil-
iferous glauconitic siltstone is exposed. It contains layers of thick Inoceramus shells and thin interbeds
of calcareous sandstone and coarse siltstone crowded
with Inoceranvus prisms. This thick, fossiliferous siltstone probably was deposited somewhat farther from
shore than the thinner and coarser equivalent rocks
north of the river. The siltstone section is overlain
by a few hundred feet of calcareous conglomerate and
sandstone that contains abundant Inoceramus prisms

C46

PALEONTOLOGY AND .STRATlJGRAPHY

and has some interbeds of siltstone and of graywacke conglomerate and sandstone. As in the outcrops to the north, the conglomerate is dominated by clasts of altered volcanic rocks, limestone, black chert, and argillite, and contains some granitoid rocks and rarely quartz.
The abundant molluscan faunule in the lower and middle parts of the section (loc. B, fig. 2) north of the Kotsina River contains species of I noceramJUs, Pinna, Simbirskites, and a belemnite which are probably of Hauterivian (late Neocomian) age. The same faunule was obtained from the dark siltstone south of the Chitina River (loc. D, fig. 2). The calcarenite near the top of the section north of the Kotsina River contains Inoceram·us ovatoides of Anderson, which is of late Hauterivian to Barremian (late Neocomian) age. The genus Simbirskites in Europe is of middle to late Hauterivian age.
The Hauterivian beds of the southwestern Wrangell Mountains are correlative with the Nelchina Limestone and overlying dark sandstone in the Nelchina area of the Talkeetna Mountains, which Bergquist (1961) found to contain Hauterivian Foraminifera. The Nelchina Limestone is an almost white calcarenite characterized by Inoceramus shell fragments and prisms. The Nelchina Limestone overlies Buchiabearing sandstone and conglomerate of Valanginian (early Neocomian) age which is absent in the Wrangell Mountains.
Siltstone, shale, and sandstone of Early Cretac·eous (Albian) age
Albian-age rocks crop out in a broad syncline at Kuskulana Pass (loc. G, fig. 2), where they rest with apparent unconformity on the Neocomian beds just described, and in a small area on the southeast flank of Mount Drum (loc. A, fig. 2). The beds near Mount Drum have a moderate dip to the west and rest upon biotite granodiorite. Biotite from this pluton yielded a potassium-argon age of 126+4 m.y. (sample 4, table 1), suggesting intrusion during Neocomian (Early Cretaceous) time. The fact that the unconformity at the base of the Hauterivian (upper Neocomian) beds in the Kotsina-Kuskulana Rivers area represents a greater structural discordance and a longer hiatus than the unconformity at the base of the· overlying Albian beds suggests that the pluton was intruded before deposition of the upper Neocomian beds of the KotsinaKuskulana Rivers area, and that it was unroofed by a combination of pre-Hauterivian and pre-Albian erosiOn.
The Albian rocks at Kuskulana Pass are similar to strata cropping out near Fourth of July Pass in the upper Chitina Valley that have been designated the

Kennicott Formation. However, usage of the name

·Kennicott" has been so varied that use of the term

should be suspended until detailed mapping is accom-

plished in the type area. At Kuskulana Pass the

Albian rocks (loc. G, fig. 2) are about 1,500 feet thick

and are dominantly siltstone. Some sandstone may

occur at the base of the section, but the lowest beds

are poorly exposed at the place visited. The bulk of

the section is siltstone, silty claystone, and shale that

are slightly greenish gray and medium dark gray and

weather to medium gray, brownish gray, or greenish

gray. The siltstone contains limestone concretions and

lentils and a few volcanic ash layers. An interval

150 feet thick in the lower part of the sequence con-

tains abundant shells of the pelecypod A ucellina in

limestone concretions and coquinoid beds. Another

interval at least 200 feet thick in the middle of the

sequence contains 5 to 10 percent of thin to thick in-

terbeds of coarse siltstone, sandstone, and minor con-

glomerate. These interbeds resemble turbidites, being

commonly graded, and many show sole markings, wavy

bedding, small-scale crossbedding, and channeled bases.

The uppermost exposed beds in this section are silt-

stone and silty claystone with limestone concretions,

but the top of the section is not preserved. Fossils were

not obtained from the highest beds, and thus their

age is unknown. A few observations along the north-

east side of the syncline at Kuskulana Pass suggest

that sandstone and conglomerate interbeds in the

middle of the sequence may increase in number and

thickness to the north.

The Albian strata near Mount Drum are litholog-

ically quite different from those at Kuskulana Pass,

for they are characterized by very carbonaceous silt

and clay shales and contain beds of granite wash. They

are also slightly younger. The exposed section (loc.

A, fig. 2) exceeds 650 feet in thickness. Its basal part

is 350 feet thick and consists mostly of gray, soft silt-

stone and silt shale resting on granodiorite. It con-

tains large limestone concretions with marine fossils,

wood fragments, and glauconite grains. Medium to

very thick interbeds of arkose, mostly coarse and peb-

bly, and of granite wash are distinctive features of

this unit. The thickest of these interbeds are com-

posed of angular and subangular granitic blocks mixed

with intraclasts of sandstone and limestone, yet they

are separated from the underlying granodiorite by

tens of feet of shallow marine siltstone. These rela-

tionships suggest that the basal Albian sea floor had

appreciable relief, and that the coarse detritus was

dumped in and buried without significant reworking,

Dark, very carbonaceous, and commonly fissile brownish-gray-weathering shale and siltstone, 175 feet thick, overlie the basal unit. These rocks have yielded some animal trails but no other fossils. The carbonaceous character of these beds, the presence of trails, and the absence of mollusks within them suggest that they nre of brackish-water or lagoonal origin. The uppermost 140 feet of the exposed section is dark, chunky, and platy weathering siltstone that contains large limestone concretions, some of which contain marine fossils. The top of the unit is unexposed, but the section is overlain by Cenozoic volcanic rocks.
The basal beds near Mount Drum contain Brerwericeras hulenense and other ammonites of the Brerwerice.ras hulenense local faunizone of late early Albian age. The upper beds contain Puzosia alaskana Imlay of probably the same age. A ucellina, which is restricted to the lower lower Albian zone of Motfitites 'robustus, is apparently absent from the Mount Drum section, which is therefore slightly younger than the A.·ucellim.a-bearing Albian beds at Kuskulana Pass. The Mount Drum se<?tion is also lithologically different from that at l{uskulana Pass; it more closely resembles the Albian beds of the northern part of the Nelchina area, which consist of coaly beds overlain by very fossiliferous shallow marine shale. The lithologic differences bet\veen the Albian rocks of l{uskulana Pass and Mount Drum suggest that the former should be named according to the formal stratigraphic nomen clature applied to the upper Chitina Valley, and the latter according to the nomenclature of the Nelchin3 area and Copper River lowland.
The upper Mesozoic rocks of the southwestern Wrangell ]\fountains record at least three episodes of deep erosion followed by sedimentation. These episodes are recorded at (1) the base of the Kotsina
Conglomerate, (2) the base of the Neocomian beds,
(3) the base of the Albian beds. These rocks also
record evidence of plutonism of latest Early or earliest Middle Jurassic age, of Late ,Jurassic age, and of
Early Cretaceous age within or near the Matanuska
geosyncline. These rocks have some overall lithologic
similarities to rocks of similar age in nearby areas,

but their stratigraphic sequence is nevertheless quite different from that found in the nearby areas. These relations illustrate that these rocks were deposited in a tectonically active trough that typically produced rocks that are lithologically similar over wide areas, but which are arranged in highly distinctive and variable local sequences. Long-range extrapolation of local stratigraphic details in these rocks is, therefore, a risky enterprise.

ALGAL STROMATOLITES OF THE UPPER CAMBRIAN COPPER RIDGE DOLOMITE IN UNION AN·D CLAIBORNE COUNTIES, TENNESSEE
By LEONARD D. HARRIS, Knoxville, Tenn.

Abstract.-Approximately 60 percent of the Upper Cambrian Copper Ridge Dolomite, which has an average· thickness of 925 feet, is composed of algal stromatolitic structures. Two forms, each apparently indicative of a particular phase of intertidal environment, are readily discernible. The most abundant stromatolite occurs as discrete, vertically stacked hemispheroids in widespread lateral zones from 5 to 140 feet thick. These zones are composed of finely to medium crystalline dolomite with abundant vugs. The other form, composed of a series of laterally linked hemispheroids, is best developed in silt-sized to very finely crystalline dolomite. Persistence of porous stromatolite zones into the subsurface, inferred from study of drill cuttings, offers a potential site for the accumulation of hydrocarbons.
The Copper Ridge Dolomite of Late Cambrian age has been studied and mapped in Tennessee for over a half century (for historical development see Bridge, 1956, chart 1) . Although the Copper Ridge has been known for a long time, few specific details of the stratigraphy and depositional environment have been learned because of the thick soil cover and the scarcity of naturally exposed continuous sections. Most descriptions of the Copper Ridge are based on details from a very few artificially exposed sections, supplemented by a study of residual products. Recently, four nearly complete sections of the Copper Ridge Dolomite have been measured by the author along a 91/2-mile stretch of the south shore of Norris Reservoir, in Union and Claiborne Counties in eastern Tennessee (fig. 1). These exposures resulted from the removal of soil cover over a 29-year period by a repeated semiannual 50-foot fluctuation of the reservoir level. These exposures are significant because they are wide and nearly complete stratigraphically, and because the exposed weathered rock shows a high contrast between various constituents, :thereby accentuating many important primary features. A study of these naturally etched rock surfaces has led to the conclusion

that the algal stromatolites were significant rock builders in the Copper Ridge.
Recent authors (Rodgers, 1953; Miller and Fuller, 1954; Bridge, 1956) have characterized the Copper Ridge as being divisible into two parts or membersa lower, dark member and an upper, light member. The lower member is made up of massive beds of predominantly brownish gray, finely to medium crystalline dolomite that emits a petroliferous odor when freshly broken. The upper member, in general, is more thinly bedded, and is composed of olive-gray to light-olive-gray silt-sized to very finely crystalline dolomite that contains only a few zones of the darker dolomite typical of the lower member. Oolitic chert is common throughout the formation but is most abundant in the upper member. Thickness cited for the Copper Ridge ranges from 800 to 1,100 feet. Oryptozoon, an algal stromatolite, has been recognized as a minor constituent occurring throughout the forma-

An algal stromatolite is a laminated structure formed by the activity of algal film in trapping and binding sediment. Algal stromatolite deposits differ from calcareous algal deposits in that they consist of preexisting clastic material collected by, not precipitated by, a mucilaginous organic film (Black, 1933, p. 184). Thus, they are organosedimentary features in which only the gross structure of the algal film is preserved; cellular and other detail structures are not preserved. Recently Logan and others (1964, p. 68-83) published a significant paper concerning the classification and environmental significance of algal stromatolites. The stromatolites do not lend themselves to limited definitions of form genera or form species. As a result, attempts to apply a strict binominal nomenclature seem to have led to unwarranted complexity (Logan and others, 1961:, p. 81), which in turn has tended to restrict the usefulness of algal strmnatolites. Logan and others (1964, p. 73-74) propose to abandon all generic and specific names, substituting a descriptive nomenclature based on the arrangement of certain geometric forms. Their basic forms are the hemispheroid and the spheroid. At present three major arrangements are recognized: (1) laterally linked hemispheroids (LLH), which may be closely spaced (LLH-C or widely spaced (LLH-S); (2) discrete, vertically stacked hemispheroids (SH) ; and (3) discrete, spheroids (SS). Apparently each of these arrangements is simply a reaction of the algal material to specific environmental processes. Thus, in a fluctuating environment one could expect to find compound forms that exhibit multiple growth forms. Evidently the majority of algal stromatolitic structures are compound forms of LLH and SH types, and these forms may be large scale, small scale, or combinations of both (Logan and others, 1964, p. 76). Many combinations of the LLH and SH arrangements are illustrated by Logan and other~ (1964, table 5, p. 78), although they recognize that all arrangements cannot be shown

FIGURE 3.-Distribution of LLH and SH stromatolites in four measured sections of the Copper Ridge Dolomite along the Norris Reservoir. (Locations of sections shown in fig. 1.)

These structures include at least two basic arrangements (LLH and SH) and many compound variations. The simplest arrangement is the closely spaced, la~terally linked hemispheriod (LLH--"C). In cross section this form is composed of literally hundreds of paper thin, undulatinglaminae (fig. 4A). The hemispheroidal nature of the laminae is best seen in silicified beds (fig. 4B). The diameters of individuals commonly range from a few inches to 1 foot; however, during construction of the Melton Hill Dam, near Oak Ridge, Tenn., J. M. l{ellberg (oral commun.) saw a silicified

bed of LLH in which the diameter of individual hemispheroids was as much as 14 feet. The LLH structures occur throughout the Copper Ridge in zones of locally mud-cracked, olive-gray, silt-sized very finely crystalline argillaceous dolomite (figs. 2, 3).
The most abundant algal stromatolites occur in units from 5 feet to 140 feet thick and have as their basic structure element discrete, crudely column-shaped SH elements that exhibit paper-thin, vertically stacked hemispheroidallaminae (figs. 5A, B). The linkage of some discrete elements by laterally developed laminae

produces an alternation of SH-LLH-SH structures. The columnal bodies, which range from 1~ inch to 1 inch in diameter, are composed of brownish-gray, Yuggy, finely to medium crystalline dolomite set in a groundmass of very finely to finely crystalline, olivegray, slightly argillaceous dolomite (fig. 50). This difference in grain size and clay content is readily

apparent on freshly broken surfaces because it gives the rock a mottled appearance. Apparently the brown color of SH elements is imparted by residual organic matter, which "\vas probably derived from breakdown of the original algal films.
Thousands of the basic SH elements occur in laterally continuous, stratum-like growth layers from 1 inch

to 3 feet thick. Silicified specimens, in which many primary structures are preserved in detail, suggest. that the growth layers resulted from periodic interruptions in the upward growth of individual SH bodies. These interruptions are recorded as erosional breaks or as laterally continuous algal stromatolitic laminae, which form natural partings that presentday weatherjng tends to accentuate. When environmental conditions favored the development of a succession of growth layers, these layers accumulated as a series of widely spaced hemispheroids, from 1 to 15 feet in diameter, connected by planar layers (figs. 6A), B). The large-scale arrangement of growth layers is somewhat similar to the arrangement of small-scale laminae of the laterally linked hemisph~roids (LLH-S) (fig. 7). The basic difference is partly in their scale, and partly in the fact that each large-scale growth layer is composed of thousands of SH columnals while each small-scale growth lamina of the LLH is not.

1964, p. 82). In the Copper Ridge the occurrence of stromatolitic debris inti1nately associated with the massive SH units suggests a higher energy environment than that in which the LLH stromatolites existed (fig. 2).
Data from the four measured sections of the Copper Ridge Dolomite along Norris Reservoir indicate several important aspects of the SI-I stromatolite. First, SH stromatolites are distributed throughout the Copper Ridge, but they are more abundant in the lower two-thirds of the formation. The concentrations which are most laterally persistent occur at the base and near

ENVIRONMENTAL AND ECONOMIC SIGNIFICANCE
Logan and others (1964, p. 82) indicate that modern stromatolites similar to the stromatolites of the Copper Ridge Dolomite are for the most part restricted to intertidal zones. Specifically, the laterally linked hemispheroid (LLH) has been found to be characteristically developed in relatively low-energy environments on protected mud fiats. A similar environment for the LLH stromatolites of the Copper Ridge Dolomite is suggested by their occurrence only in silt-sized to very finely crystalline laminated dolomite that locally exhibits mud cracks. The modern vertically stacked hemispheroidal stromatolites (SH) are best developed along exposed intertidal headlands (Logan and others,

the middle of the formation (fig. 3). Commonly, outcrops of stromatolite zones contain abundant vugs. The vugs are concentrated at the centers of large hemispheroids or are alined parallel to growth layers. This definite spacial alinement of vugs suggests that they were produced by processes operating prior to or shortly after burial; however, present-day weathering accentuates them.
The occurrence of laterally continuous porous zones is signifi.cant, because if these zones persist into the subsurface they may prove to be good reservoirs in which oil and gas have accumulated. Partial confirmation that the Copper Ridge may be porous in the subsurface is suggested by a study of the cuttings from a complete section of the Copper Ridge between 4,960 and 6,102 feet in Lee County, Va., in the Shell Oil Co. L. S. Bales No. 1 well, located about 26 miles northeast of the area of this report. In that well the author found small vugs and intercrystalline voids, on the order of 3 to 7 percent by volume, throughout what

stromatolite zones 111 the lower half of the Copper Ridge along Norris Reservoir (fig.. 3). Fresh water was produced from the L. S. Bales No. 1 well at the rate of approximately 20 barrels per hour from a depth of 6,050 feet in the stromatolite zone at the base of the form·ation.

COMPARISON OF ORDOVICIAN EUGEOSYNCLINAL AND MIOGEOSYNCLINAL QUARTZITES OF THE CORDILLERAN GEOSYNCLINE
By KEITH B. KETNER, Denver, Colo.

A.bstraot.-Ordovician quartzite of the Cordilleran miogeosyncline is extremely pure, medium-grained quartz arenite whose grains are frosted, well rounded, and well sorted. Approximately correlative quartzites of the eugeosyncline are equally pure, and the grains are similarly frosted and equally well rounded, but they are more coarse and not quite so well sorted. The high degree of compositional and textural maturity of quartzites of both parts of the geosyncline indicates that they were derived from sedimentary terranes. Stratigraphic and textural relations show that quartzites of the eugeosyncline were derived from the west side of the geosyncline.
In Ordovician time, the Cordilleran geosyncline consisted of two parallel belts of contrasting sedimentation. The eastern belt, or miogeosyncline, was characterized by the deposition of carbonate sediments; the western belt, or eugeosyncline, was characterized by the deposition of siliceous sediments and the extrusion of lavas. An intermediate zone in the northern part of Nevada was later partly covered by rocks thrust eastward from the eugeosyncline (Roberts and others, 1958).
Throughout most of the miogeosyncline, quartzite beds-known in parts of Nevada, Utah, and California as the Eureka Quartzite (Kirk, 1933, p. 27), and in parts of Utah and Idaho as the Swan Peak Quartzite (R. J. Ross, 1953, p. 22)-are sandwiched between Lower and Upper Ordovician carbonate rocks (fig. 1) . Because of their lithic similarity as indicated in this report, and because of stratigraphic relations to be brought out in another report, it seems certain that the Eureka and Swan Peak Quartzites are parts of one genetic unit whose basal beds are of somewhat different age from place to place, and whose deposition was interrupted in places by brief periods of carbonate deposition. A northward extension of this widespread unit is included in the type Kinnikinic Quartzite of central Idaho, described by C. P. Ross (1937,

p. 17) . In southern Nevada and California·, tongues of the same unit wedge out among finer grained rocks in the intermediate zone between the miogeosyncline and eugeosyncline. These tongues form parts of the Toquima Formation (Ferguson, 1924, p. 22) in southern Nevada, the Johnson Spring Formation (D. C. Ross, 1965, p. 26) in the Inyo Range of California, and the Convict Lake Formation (Rinehart and Ross, 1964, p. 20) in the Sierra Nevada of California. Throughout its great extent, the Ordovician System of the Cordilleran miogeosyncline is extraordinarily simple and regular.
In contrast, the Ordovician System of the eugeosyncline is extremely complex and irregular. Quartzite units alternate with bedded chert, siliceous mudstone, and greenstone throughout the system, and individual lithic units and sequences in one exposure generally cannot be recognized in another exposure. The thickness of quartzite varies greatly, ranging from thousands of feet in the Valmy Formation to scores of feet in the Petes Summit Formation of Kay (Kay, 1960; Kay and Crawford, 1964) and a few feet in the Vinini Formation and the Basco Formation of Lovejoy (1959). However, the eugeosynclil).al quartzite is lithically nearly as uniform as that of the miogeosyncline.
In this report, the lithologies of quartzites from the miogeosyncline are compared with those from the eugeosyncline, and conclusions drawn from this comparison are used in inference of the sources of sand in the quartzites.
COMPARATIVE LITHIC DATA
Quartzite of the eugeosyncline is remarkably similar to that of the miogeosyncline in some respects but persistently, though subtly, different in others. In the

following discussion, and especially in the table of chemical composition, similarities seem to outweigh differences, yet the subtle distinctions in grain size and sorting may be of critical importance in understandii1g the relationships between the two types of quartzite and between the parts of the geosyncline in which they were deposited. Comparative lithic and chemical data are discussed in detail in the following paragraphs. Comparative stratigraphic data, which will be discussed more fully in another report, are summarized in table 1.

Light d'etrital minerals
More than 99 percent by weight of the detrital grains in both the eugeosynclinal and miogeosynclinal quartzites are quartz. (Some of the chemical analyses in table 1 show less than 99 percent Si02 because nonquartz inclusions within detrital quartz grains are

included in the analyses.) All sand-size grains are monocrystalline, but a small proportion of the siltsize fraction in the eugeosynclinal quartzite is composed of detrital chert. Not a single grain of detrital feldspar was detected in 320 thin sections of quartzite.
Heavy detrital minerals
In comparison with other notably pure sandstone, such as the St. Peter Sandstone (Thiel, 1935, p. 595), the quartzites of the Cordilleran geosyncline have an extremely low content of heavy minerals. Heavy min-

Zircon and tourmaline constitute at least 95 percent by weight of the heavy detrital mineral observed in composite samples from 30 sites (fig. 1). Rutile, mica, and unidentified minerals make up the remaining few percent. In all but two samples (from sites 49 and 44), zircon outweighs tourmaline, usually by a wide margin. Spectrographic analyses (table 3) indicate higher percentages of zirconium than those calculated from the amounts of detrital zircon. Part

tained in detrital quartz grains and part of it may be a result ot the inherent inaccura·cy of spectrographic analyses of concentrations so near the detection limit. Samples of quartzite from the eugeosyncline and from the southern part of the miogeosyncline commonly yield a few sand-size books and flakes of biotite and muscovite. Although the amounts are negligible, their presence is puzzling in view of the vulnerability of micas to comminution.
Nondetrital minerals
Pyrite cubes, many partially or wholly oxidized, are common in quartzites of 'both pal'lts of the geosyncline. The small regional variation in iron content of the quartzites, show.Ii by chemical analyses in table 3, sugoo-ests that the pyrite, in which most of the iron .c.ontent of the rock is concentrated, is related to depositiOn of the quartzite rather than to random local epigenetic processes.
Amorphous carbon is a distinctive, though minor, constituent of the eugeosynclinal quartzite. It is responsible for the dark and dirty look of most outcrops of the eugeosynclinal quartzite, and is probably responsible for the misconception that quartzite of high purity is unusual in the eugeosynclinal environment.
Authigenic feldspar grains of silt size are detectable in some samples of quartzite from the miogeosyncline. The widespread but low content of potassium indicated by the chemical analyses may mean that authigenic feldspare is a common though sparse ingredient in most samples.
Dolomite cements quartz grains at a few places near the top and base of the quartzite in the miogeosyncline. It forms the cement in some thin sandstone units in the Vinini and Basco Formations but is totally absent as a cement in the quartzites of the Valmy Formation.
Quartz overgrowths are almost a universal feature of the miogeosynclinal quartzite and a common feature of that of the eugeosyncline. The most likely sources of the silica in these overgrowths are the pressure points, or original points of contact, between detrital grains.
Collophane constitutes about one percent of some beds of quartzite along the eastern edge of the miogeosyncline. Elsewhere it is extremely uncommon. Typically, the collophane is in the form of sand-sized curved plates with internal layering.
Mineral inclusions in detrital quartz grains have not yet been studied in detail, but routine inspection of thin sections indicates that inclusions in quartz of both the eugeosyncline and miogeosyncline are similar in kind and amount.

Grain size and sorting
Grain size and sortiitg were studied in four ways: (1) About 320 thin sections from 30 sites (fig. 1) were scanned and the maximum apparent diameter of the largest grain for each site was measured and recorded in figure 2. (2) The maximum diameter of the largest .r.ircon in heavy-mineral concentrates of composite samples from each of the 30 sites was also measured and recorded in figure 2. (3) The size-frequency distribution of constituent grains was determined in two samples which, owing to their carbonate cement, could be completely disaggregated (fig. 3) . (4) Photographic enlargements of all thin sectiQns were made by projecting them on photographic paper through crossed Polaroid sheets. These prints were assembled in stratigraphic order and the columns arranged in

These studies show that: (1) Quartzites of both the eugeosyncline and the miogeosyncline are composed of well-sorted sand, mostly of fine to medium size (fig. 4). (2) Quartzite of the eugeosyncline contains a higher proportion of coarse sand, and grains of larger maximum size, than does that of the miogeosyncline, and it is therefore somewhat less well sorted (fig. 5). (3) Regional variations in grain size and sorting -within the eugeosyncline, and within the miogeosyncline, are small. Further study and additional data are required for interpretation of the genetic significance of these variations.

Grain surfaces
Only a few samples of Cordilleran Ordovician quartzite can be disaggregated to permit observation of original grain surfaces. However, certain strata from eugeosynclinal sites 44 and 49 and miogeosynclinal sites 60, 40, 19, 6, and 32 (fig. 1) contain enough carbonate cement to permit disaggregation with hydrochloric acid. The surfaces of all grains freed in this manner are frosted. When examined under high magnification the surfaces are seen to be roughened in a way that suggests corrosion by differential solution rather than pitting and scratching by abrasive action.

and relatively fine grain size that are typical of Ordovician quartzite in the miogeosyncline. X 20. Crossed nicols.

Chemical composition
The chemical compositions of the eugeosynclinal and miogeosynclinal quartzites are virtually identical (table 3). The relative quantities of only two ~le­ ments are consistently different by a significant amount. The barium content of the eugeosynclinal quartzites generally is several times that of the miogeosynclinal quartzites; and although it is not among the elements sought by analysis, elemental carbon commonly is visible in quartzites of the eugeosyncline, but not in those of the miogeosyncline. Much of the non-quartz material indicated by chemical analyses is due to mineral inclusions in quartz grains rather than to separate grains of other minerals.

CONCLUSIONS
Constituent grains of Ordovician quartzites in both parts of the Cordilleran geosyncline were derived from sedimentary terranes composed, at least partly, of quartz sandstone. The high degree of composition-

Grain ro.undness

The high degree of textural maturity indicated by the excellent grain sorting is confirmed by a high degree of roundness (figs. 6, 7). Quartz, zircon, and tourmaline in quartzite of both the eugeosyncline and the miogeosyncline are very well rounded, comparing almost perfectly with grains in the St. Peter Sandstone (Thiel, 1935, pls. 45, 46, and 48). Roundness is somewhat obscured by secondary overgrowths but can be seen in thin sections by using nonpolarized light.

al and textural maturity of these quartzites precludes a large contribution from igneous or metamorphic provenance terranes. The lack of compound quartz grains and metamorphic minerals further preclude metamorphic terranes.
Grains composing Middle Ordovician quartzite of the eugeosyncline must have been derived from the western side of the geosyncline. Their slightly coarser size and relatively poor sorting make it extremely unlikely that they could have been transported westward across the miogeosyncline where smaller and better sorted grains were being deposited. Moreover, as James Gilluly has pointed out (oral commun., 1954), the deposition of Early Ordovician eugeosynclinal quartzites was contemporaneous with the deposition of quartz-free carbonate rocks in the miogeosyncline.

EOCENE PALEOSOL IN THE NORTHERN GREAT PLAINS
By WAYNE A. PETTYJOHN, Bismarck, N. Dak.

Abst1·act.-A lateL·itic soil profile of probable late Eocene age crops out in widely separated localities in the northern Great Plains. Especially well developed in western South Dakota nnd northwestern Neuraskn, it is characterized by vivid purple, yellow, aud greenish-gray sediments directly underlying the Chadron ]!..,ormation of the \\'hite River Group of Oligocene nge. 1.'he stratigraphic units on which the soil profile formed range in age from lDnrly or Lnte Cretaceous to late Eocene.
A soil profile of probable late Eocene age offers clues to the topography and areal distribution of stratigraphic units in the northern Great Plains region in late Eocene time. It is exposed at several widely separated localities in western North Dakota, western South Dakota, northwestern Nebraska, and eastern Wyoming (fig. 1), and several specific localities in So~th Dakota are described in detail by Pettyjohn (1964; in press) .
The soil profile, recognized for many years, has been discussed by numerous authors, including Ward (1922, 1926), Toepelman (1922), Wanless (1923), Schultz and Stout (19.55), I-Iarvey (1956), and Dunham (1961). Ward (1922, p. 18-20) described variously colored weathered strata in the Badlands area of South Dakota, near the town of Interior, as the "Interior Phase" of the Pierre (Shale) but also suggested that these same strata may instead be equivalent to the Fox I-Iills Sandstone. Although Wanless (1923, p. 194) inclined toward including the "Interior Formation of "\\Tard" as part of the Pierre, Ward (1926) concludea from his further observations that his "Interior Phase" is really Fox Hills. Most subsequent workers, however, have regarded the "Interior Phase" to be a weathered zone locally present on outcrops of the Pierre Shale (Upper Cretaceous) in southwestern South Dakot·a and northwestern Nebraska.
Schultz and Stout (1955) suggested the term "Interior Paleosol Complex" for these weathered sediments in northwestern Nebraska, and adjacent parts of Wyoming and South Dakota. They designated as

the type locality of the paleosol the area originally defined by Ward (1922) as the type area of the "Interior Phase" of the Pierre. Schultz and Stout recognized the age of the soil profile as pre-Chadron (Oligocene) and post-Pierre Shale in Nebraska and South Dakota. In addition, they suggested that "Ward's interpretation (of the Interior) is now only of historical interest" (Schultz and Stout, 1955, p. 25).
Harvey (1956) , in his paleoecological study of the W~1ite R~ver Group faunas in Sioux County, Nebr., briefly discussed Ward's "Interior Formation." He noted (1956, p. 22) that "In later years most workers have agreed that this 'formation' is simply a weathered phase of the Pierre."
A major question remains-what is the "Interior Fortnation" ~ l\{ost workers agree that (1) it is not a
d(i~s)tinict t wfoarsmfaotiromne,d(2b)yitcrheepmreisceanl tswaeawtheeartihnegredofzotnhe~
Pie~re Shale, ~ 4) the period of weathering took place durmg post-Pierre and pre-Oligocene time, and (5) the term is of only historical interest. This writer has shown previously (Pettyjohn, 1964), however, that ~ome of the above assumptions are probably incorrect, In tl:at (1). the .multicolored paleosol is definitely a strat~grapluc unit that is mappable over wide areas, (2) It was formed by chemical weathering of rocks at least as old as the Skull Creek Shale of Early Cretaceous age and rocks as young as the Slim Butt~s Formation o~ Bjork (1965) of latest Eocene age, and (3) the periOd of soil formation is probably late Eocene.
In .view of the general confusion concerning the memung and use of the terms "Interior Phase" of the Pierre, '.'Interior Formation," or "Interior" period of weathermg, the writer is inclined to reject Schultz and Stoufs term "Interior Paleosol Complex" because the name "Interior" is surrounded with confusion and contradiction. The term "Eocene paleosol" is sufficiently descriptive, and does not limit the paleosol to scattered outcrops near Interior, S. Dak.

THE SOIL PROFILE
The paleosol was formed by weathering of rocks probably exposed during late Eocene time. In addition to being characterized by vivid colors, these weathered deposits generally lack primary sedimentary features in the upper part and have chemical properties that differ from those of unweathered strata. Where the soil profile is buried beneath younger rocks, it is overlain disconformably by the White River Group of Oligocene age, or by Pleistocene gravel.
Dunham (1961, p. 55) apparently was the first to recognize the lateritic origin of the paleosol. He described its major features in the Chadron arch area in northwestern Nebraska and south-central South Dakota (Pine Ridge area, fig. 1) and assigned an Eocene(~) age to it. He divided the profile into three major zones which, in descending order, are the transformed zone, the oxidized zone, and the boundary zone. All three of these zones can be recognized in the vicinity of Chadron, Nebr., as well as in parts of the Big Badlands of South Dakota (fig. 1). Although not all the zones can be recognized in areas farther north in the Great Plains, one or two zones generally are present. Dunham's terminology is used in this report.
The transformed zone is as much as 25 feet thick near Interior, S. Dak., where the paleosol is developed on the Pierre Shale (Interior area, fig. 1). There the upper few feet of the transformed zone consists of purple or lilac noncalcareous clay, whereas the lower part is characterized by green and brownish-gray clay intercalated with thin layers of purple clay. The transformed zone is highly weathered, almost totally lacks effective porosity, and has a very low calcium carbonate content. J{aolinite, illite, and iron oxides are abundant; diffusion banding is locally present near iron concretions (Pettyjohn, 1964, p. 179) .
The underlying oxidized zone generally consists of green or reddish-brown clay and is as much as 38 feet thick near Interior, S. Dak. Its calcium carbonate content is low in the upper part but increases with depth. IIematite and limonite commonly fill joints and cracks in concretions. l{aolinite and illite appear to be the dominant clays. Primary sedimentary features of the parent rock may be present. Because most unaltered Cretaceous and Tet~tiary rocks in the northern Great Plains contain limestone or siderite concre, tions, the general lack of these concretions within the oxidized zone suggests that they were either altered to limonite and hematite, or dissolved.
The boundary zone, which consists partly of weathered and partly of unweathered rocks, has a considerable range in thickness and in places is thicker than 60

feet. Although from a distance the contact between the boundary zone and unweathered rocks appears to be abrupt, it actually is quite indistinct and is gradational over several tens of feet.
The features of the paleosol just described are valid only where the weathered sediments consist predominantly of clay. In areas where the original sediments consist mainly of silt or sand, such as outcrops of the Fox Hills Sandstone, the soil profile may be difficult to recognize. Commonly the silt is greenish gray and the sand or sandstone is yellow or rusty brown; the calcium carbonate content generally is low. At a given place the percentage of calcimn carbonate is related to the permeability of the strata and to the depth below the original soil surface. A distinguishing characteristic of the sand or silty deposits is the presence within the sandy strata of galls, or thin layers of clay, which are generally some shade of red.
Toepelman (1922, p. 65) suggested that the various shades of red, green, and yellow of the rocks here regarded as constituting a paleosol were derived from the overlying White River Group. For several reasons, however, this cannot be the case. If the color were carried down the faces of outcrops of the White River Group and stained the underlying sediments, the coloring would be merely superficial, which it is not. In addition, water percolating downward through the White River Group would be unlikely to stain the. underlying sediments, because the transformed zone and the upper part of the oxidized zone are relatively impermeable. In fact, springs and seeps commonly issue at the base of the White River Group during the wet season, and thick layers of gypsum mark the contact locally. Finally, the White River Group is calcareous in many parts of the section, whereas the paleosol either lacks calcite or contains only minor amounts of it. Downward-percolating water would certainly have removed calcium carbonate from the White River Group and enriched the paleosol if the latter were permeable.
LOCATION AND DESCRIPTION OF SPE·CIFIC OUTCROPS
The paleosol can be traced northward and westward from Interior, S.Dak., along the Cheyem1e River and its tributaries. It is especially well exposed along the valleys of Sage, Spring, Bear, and Indian Creeks in Pennington County, S.Dak. (Sage Creek area, fig. 1). As in the vicinity of Interior, the paleosol was formed by weathering of the Pierre Shale; it is at least 30 feet thick.
In the Creighton Mesa area (fig. 1) nearly all of the upper part of the Fox Hills has been altered, but owing to later erosion the paleosol profile commonly is not complete. The effects of weathering are readily visible,

C64

PALEONTOLOGY AND STRATEGRAPHY

however, because the shale layers are commonly purple, the silt zones .are light grayish green, and the sand and sandstone outcrops are shades of rusty brown and yellow. As much as 60 feet of the weathered rocks is exposed in this area.
Ward (1922, 1926) described the outcrops of the Fox Hills Sandstone in the Creighton Mesa area and used data on the high percentage of sand in those outcrops to support his view that the "Interior" is part of the Fox Hills. Toepelman (1922) and Wanless (1923) suggested that the "Interior" at its type locality is a part of the Pierre Shale. The writer believes that all these conclusions are valid: these workers were dealing with a soil profile that developed on several different formations. If Ward's observations had been given more attention by later workers, the true nature of the paleosol probably would have been recognized sooner.
The paleosol is especially well exposed in the drainage basins of Spring, Battle, and French Creeks (Battle Creek area, fig. 1), south of Rapid City. From an airplane the characteristic reddish purple of the soil profile appears to be quite widespread. Here the paleosol, at least 35 feet thick, was formed by weathering of the Pierre Shale and the Niobrara Formation. In this area it probably is present on older formations also.
In the Enning Mesa area (fig. 1), to the north across the Cheyenne River, the paleosol formed on the upper part of the Fox Hills Sandstone (Pettyjohn, 1964; in press). Here the paleosol is at least 88 feet thick. W. L. Russell 1 reported that the Hell Creek Formation on Lemon Butte in the drainage basin of Sulphur Creek, which forms the north boundary of Enning Mesa, is purple, green, and yellow. Probably these ·colored rocks represent the paleosol in that area.
Two particularly good exposures of the paleosol are on Fox Ridge and on the adjacent Signal Butte (Fox Ridge area, fig. 1). Here the paleosol was formed on the Fort Union Formation (Ludlow Member) of Paleocene age. The paleosol also is present on scattered outcrops of the Fort Union in areas farther north where the lmvest part of the White River Group is present or was removed by recent erosion.
The Golden Valley Formation, where it crops out in west-central North Dakota, has been considerably altered by pre-Oligocene weathering. Jepsen (1963), on the basis of fossil vertebrates, has dated this formation as early Eocene. Bjork (1964, 1965), in a study of his Slim Buttes Formation of supposed late Eocene age in Harding County, S. Dak. (Slim Buttes
1 W. L. Russell, no date, Stratigraphy and structure of western South Dakota: South Dakota Geol. Survey unpub. rept., 295 p.

area, fig. 1), reported sediments which, from their description, appear to represent the paleosol. The writer has not examined these exposures or exposures of similar variously colored sediments that form the upper part of the Ravenscrag Beds in southwestern Saskatchewan. The Ravenscrag is the Canadian equivalent of the Fort Union Formation.
Similar small exposures of the paleosol are present locally in the Lance Creek area, Wyoming (fig. 1). In these outcrops the soil profile is on the Lance Formation of Late Cretaceous age.
Robinson and others (1964, p. 105) described the disconformable contact of the White River Group and the Skull Creek Shale of Early Cretaceous age in an area about 4 miles north-northeast of Missouri Buttes in northeastern Wyoming (Missouri Buttes area, fig. 1). In this area, 11 to 15 miles south of Hulett, "the Skull Creek shale is bleached shades of light gray and pink for several feet below the contact." These bleached clay-shales probably represent the paleosol.

AGE OF THE SOU PROFILE
Everywhere that the writer examined rocks overlain by the oldest part of the White River Group, the paleosol is present immediately below the contact. In some areas where the White River Group has been removed recently by erosion, at least part of the paleosol is present. In areas where the oldest White River sediments are not present, either because of ancient erosion or nondeposition, the paleosol appears to be absent. In such places the paleosol and possibly the basal Oligocene rocks also were eroded prior to the deposition of younger sediments of the White River Group.
Nowhere has the paleosol been observed on or in the White River Group of Oligocene age. Thus the available evidence indicates that the period of soil formation was later than deposition of the Slim Buttes Formation in the Eocene Epoch and earlier than deposition of the White River Group in the Oligocene Epoch. Development of the paleosol is believed, therefore, to have occurred during the closing phase of the Eocene Epoch. Although the formation of the paleosol was probably time-transgressive, the stratigraphic relationships and available palentological data seem to indicate a relatively short period of time.

Topography

'PA'LEOGEOGRAPHY

The Eocerie paleosol was developed on a surface of considerable topographic relief. Along the flanks of the Black Hills, the land surface on which the soil formed sloped gently away from the central uplift. The region in the vicinity of Interior, S. Dak., appears

PE·TTYJOHN

C65

to have been a large but relatively flat-floored ba~in. Because the soil profile lies at progressively lower altitudes in the upper valley of Sage Creek, that part of the channel in which Sage Creek now flows, roughly parallel to the northeast boundary of the Badlands Nationa.l ~ionument, is believed to be a pre-Oligocene channel. It seems likely thn,t much of the area in southwestern South Dakota, where Tertiary formations are present, represents a pre-Oligocene basin.
The Creighton ~iesa. area was probably only slightly higher than its present elevation, and was nearly flat. The paleosol in the Enning ~1esa area probably was formed on a nearly level surface, because there the contact between the Fox I-Iills Sandstone and the White River Group does not vary more than 5 feet from a horizontal plane.
The writer is not familiar with the details of the late Eocene topography of the other areas, but a few isolated exposures of the Eocene paleosol suggest that the surface on which it developed was 'topographically higher, northward and westward from Enning Mesa.
The data suggest a relatively flat expanse of land that was drained by relatively wide, deep, and steepwalled valleys. Badland areas may have been locally present in the large valleys. The area was, no doubt, well drained, but the preservation of the altered sediments suggested that erosion was localized or of small extent. The coarse clastic material that locally forms the basal part of the 'Vhite River Group, particularly in the Badlands areas, suggests a minor period of uplift in the central part of the Black Hills during latest Eocene or earliest Oligocene time. In some areas the eastward-flowing streams had sufficient discharge to erode channels into, but rarely through, the soil profile.
Climate
The climate under which the soil profile was formed can be inferred from the sediments that were the end products. Spectrographic analyses of parts of the soil profile show relatively high concentrations of iron a.nd alumina :in the upper parts and a general lack of calcium (Dunham, 1961; Pettyjohn, 1964). Lack of calcium and carbonate and enrichment by iron and nJumina indicate :1 pedalfer-type soil.
The ancient soil under consideration is characterized as a whole by alumina enrichment, moderate to high iron enrichment, red and yellow colors, kaolinization, poor vertical differentiation, and relatively great thickness. These features are those of a pedalfer, particularly of a laterite.
Modern deep lateritic soils are formed in hot, wet

regions where leaching and eluviation are intensive. A constant supply of moisture in conjunction with high temperature is necessary for soil formation to continue throughout the year. In tropical rain forests, bacterial action prevents large accumulations of hun1us on and near the surface even though large quantities of vegetation are present. For complete leaching of soluble materials such as calciun1 carbonate, a soil must be well drained.
SUMMARY
Although exposed in widely separated localities in the northern part of the Great Plains, the late Eocene paleosol is most conspicuous in western South Dakota. It probably was developed under hot and wet climatic conditions in relatively flat areas having deep and widely spaced drainage systems. Sedimentary and chemical features of the profile suggest a lateritictype soil.

CORRELATION OF LOWER CAMBRIAN AND SOME PRECAMBRIAN STRATA IN THE SOUTHERN GREAT BASIN, CALIFORNIA AND NEVADA
By JOHN H. STEWART, Menlo Park, Calif.

A.bst1·act.-Lower Cambrian and some Precambrian strata of the Spring Mountains-Death Valley region of Nevada and California correlate with rocks of the 'Vhite-Inyo Mountains region of California. The equivalent strata generally increase in thickness, are more calcareous, and become finer grained northwestward from the Spring Mountains-Death Valley facies to the White-Inyo Mountains facies. The Reed Dolomite, formerly correlated with the Noonday Dolomite, is here correlated with dolomite layers in the upper part of the Stirling Quartzite.
The Lower Cambrian and some of the conformably underlying Precambrian strata thicken and change facies from largely coarse clastic strata (Spring Mountains-Death Valley facies) in the Spring Mountains and Death Valley region of Nevada and California (fig. 1) to finer grained clastic rocks (White-Inyo Mountains facies) to the northwest in the White and Inyo Mountains region of California. The amount of limestone and dolomite increases to the northwest between these two regions. The present study was undertaken to determine the correlations of lithic units between these two facies. This report is part of a continuing study of the stratigraphy and sedimentary history of the Lower Cambrian and Precambrian strata in the southern Great Basin.
Acknowledgments.-The author is grateful for the· use of unpublished stratigraphic sections kindly sup-
plied by H. R. Cornwall, F. J. l{leinhampl, J. F.
~1cAllister, and M. W. Reynolds, of the U.S. Geologieal Survey, and by C. A. Nelson, of the University of California at Los Angeles.
STRATIGRAPHY AND CO'RRELATION
The formations recognized in the Spring MountainsDeath Valley facies are, in ascending order, the Noonday Dolomite, Johnnie Formation and Stirling Quartzite of Precambrian age, the Wood Canyon Formation of Cambrian and Precambrian age, the Zabriskie

Quartzite of Early Cambrian age, the Carrara Formation of Early and Middle Cambrian age, and the Bonanza King Formation of Middle and Late Cambrian age (fig. 2). In the White-Inyo Mountains facies, which includes strata equivalent to the Spring Mountains-Death Valley facies, the following formations are recognized, in ascending order: the Wyman Formation, Reed Dolomite, and Deep Spring Formation of Precambrian age; Campito Formation of Cambrian and Precambrian age; the Poleta, Harkless, and Saline Valley Formations, and Mule Spring Limestone of Early Cambrian age; and the Monola Formation of Middle Cambrian age.
Correlations between the vVhite-Inyo Mountains facies and the Spring Mountains-Death Valley facies have long been attempted. Geologists have in general considered the Noonday Dolomite to be equivalent to the Reed Dolomite, the Johnnie Formation equivalent to the Deep Spring Formation, and the Stirling Quartzite equivalent to the Campito Formation. The possibility of these correlations has been indicated by Nolan (1924, p. 34), Hazard (1937, p. 301), Nelson (1962a), and Mcl{ee and Moiola (1962, p. 533-536). The present study, however, indicates that the Noonday Dolomite, Johnnie Formation, and the lower part. of the Stirling Quartzite correlate with strata below the Reed Dolomite, and that dolomite layers in the upper part of the Stirling Quartzite thicken to the northwest and form the Reed Dolomite. In addition, the study indicates that the lower part of the Wood Canyon Formation is largely equivalent to the Deep· Spring Formation, and the middle part of the Wood Canyon Formation is equivalent to the Campito Formation. These correlations were largely suggested to
me by J. F. McAllister before the present study was
undertaken. Furthermore, C. A. Nelson and A. R.
Palmer (written commun., 1962) indicated, 011 the basis of lithologic similarity and contained fossils, that.

the upper part of the Wood Canyon Formation correlated with the Poleta Formation, and that the Zabriskie Quartzite correlated with strata in the Harkless Formation. These correlations have been largely substantiated by the present study.
Noonday Dolomite
The Noonday Dolomite (named by Hazzard, 1937, p.300-301) is a fairly homogeneous and massive, very pale orange, coarsely crystalline dolomite. It lies with marked unconformity (I-Iazzard, 1937, p. 301) on the underlying Precambrian strata. The Noonday Dolomite crops out widely in the southern part of the Death Valley region (sec 11, fig. 2), but it may not extend farther north, as it is apparently absent in the Funeral

Mountains (L. A. Wright and B. W. Troxel, written com.mun., 1964). Perhaps, however, the absence of the Noonday Dolomite in the Funeral Mountains can be explained as a local feature, and the Noonday may grade laterally, with change of facies, into some part of the Wyman Formation or even lower unexposed rocks in the White-Inyo Mountains region. This latter correlation is speculative and is the subject of continuing study. The Wyman Formation (named by Maxson, 1935) consist of dark-gray phyllite and interbedded limestone, or marble, layers. Commonly calcsilicate hornfels are present. The Wyman Formation has a minimum thickness (Nelson, 1962b, p. 140) of 9,000 feet. (shown only in part on fig. 2) ; no stratigraphic base is exposed.

PALEONTOLOGY AND STRATIGRAPHY

Johnnie Formation
The Johnnie Formation (named by Nolan, 1929, p. 461-463) conformably overlies the Noonday Dolomite (sec. 11, fig. 2) and consists of a. variety of lithologic types including green and brown phyllitic siltstone, light-colored very fine grained to coarse-grained quartzite, a few layers of conglomeratic quartzite, and minor amounts of yellowish-brown-weathering dolomite and reddish silty limestone and limy siltstone. The upper part of the Johnnie Formation consists dominantly of greenish siltStone and reddish limy siltstone or silty limestone, and has been designated the Rainstorm Member by Barnes and others (1965) for exposures in the northeast part of the Nevada Test Site (fig. 1). Locally, as in the Echo Canyon area (sec. 8, fig. 2), -strata laterally equivalent to the Rainstorm Member contain minor amounts of granule conglomerate. A persistent and distinctive yellowish-brown-weathering oolitic dolomite (commonly referred to as the "Johnnie oolite") occurs near the base of the Rainstorm Member (fig. 2) . This oolite is generally 6 to 12 feet thick. The Johnnie Formation may correlate with part of the Wyman Formation of the White-Inyo Mountains, but this correlation is uncertain.
Stirling Quartzite
The Stirling Quartzite (named by Nolan, 1929, p. 463) is herein divisible into five members in the Spring Mountains-Death Valley area. These members are referred to informally as A, B, C, D, and E members, in ascending order (fig. 2) . The A member consists of yellowish-gray quartzite and conglomeratic quartzite in the lower part and grayish-purple quartzite and minor amounts of purplish phyllitic siltstone in the upper part. The upper 100 feet or more of the A member is generally yellowish gray. In the Echo Canyon area (sec. 8, fig. 2), the A member contains three phyllitic siltstone units that range in thickness from about 175 to 250 feet. The uppermost phyllitic siltstone unit in Echo Canyon contains a prominent 45-foot-thick limestone and dolomite unit about 50 feet below the top.
The B member is a thin unit consisting of grayishred-purple and grayish-purple coarse siltstone to very fine grained sandstone and minor amounts of coarsegrained quartzite. The amount of coarse-grained quartzite increases upward. Some brown-weathering sandy dolomite layers occur in the lower part of the member in the Funeral Mountains (sec. 8, fig. 2).
The C member consists of greenish-gray siltstone in the lower part and purplish siltstone and finegrained quartzite in the upper part. The amount of purplish quartzite in the upper part of the member decreases markedly toward the northwest from the

Nopah Range (sec. 11, fig. 2) and is largely replaced by green siltstone in the Echo Canyon area (sec. 8, fig. 2). Thin layers of light-brown-weathering dolomite are common in the lower 20 to 200 feet.
The D member consists, in the Echo Canyon and Bare Mountain areas (sees. 8 and 7, fig. 2), of very pale orange and light-gray dolomite and minor amounts of limestone. The upper part of the member in these areas contains some quartzite and siltstone and is transitional into the overlying E member. The D member to the south and southeast of Echo Canyon and Bare Mountain grades laterally into quartzite and dolomitic sandstone that are difficult to separate from the overlying quartzite of the E member.
The E member of the Stirling Quartzite is a thick homogeneous sequence of pale-red quartzite and conglomeratic quartzite. In Echo Canyon the lower half of the E member also contains minor amounts of siltstone and silty sandstone layers and a few: brownweathering dolomitic sandstone layers. On Bare Mountain the lower part of the E member consists of siltstone and quartzite; the siltstone constitutes about half of the lowermost part of the member, decreases in amount upward, and is absent from the top 300 feet of the member. The top 300 feet is a prominent yellowish-gray to white quartzite. Some dolomite layers also occur in the lower half of the E member on Bare Mountain.
The Stirling Quartzite thickens and contains a higher proportion of silty and carbonate strata to the northwest from the Nopah Range and Spring Mountains. In the Funeral Mountains (sec 8, fig. 2) and on Bare Mountain (sec. 7, fig. 2), silty strata and dolomite constitute a noticeable part of the Stirling, although over half of the formation is quartzite.
The A, B, and C members of the Stirling Quartzite may correlate with the upper part of the Wyman Formation, but this correlation is uncertain and is the subject of further study.
The D and E members of the Stirling Quartzite are correlated with the Reed Dolomite (named by Kirk, in Knopf, 1918, p. 24) of the White-Inyo Mountains region (sees. 1 and 2, fig. 2). The Reed Dolomite, which overlies the WyJ!lan Formation, has been
divided by Nelson (1962b, p.141; 1963) into three members: a lower member composed of very pale orange
dolomite; a middle member-the Hines Tonguecomposed of yellowish-gray quartzite, brown-weather-
ing dolomitic sandstone, and minor amounts of dolomite and sandy dolomite; and an upper member com-
posed of very pale orange dolomite and local minor amounts of light-gray limestone. The D member of the Stirling Quartzite in the Funeral Mountains and

STEWART

C71

on Bare ~ountain is lithologically similar to, if not identical with, the lower member of the Reed Dolomite, and these two members are considered to be correlative. The E member on Bare Mountain and the Hines Tongue in the White-Inyo Mountains area also have a similar lithology and are considered to be largely correlative. The upper member of the Reed Dolomite is apparently equivalent to the uppermost part of the E member and the lowermost part of the overlying vVood Canyon Formation, although at Bare Mountain this part of the Stirling Quartzite and Wood Canyon Formation contains only a few limestone or dolomite layers, whereas the upper member of the Reed Dolomite is predominantly dolomite.
Wood Canyon Forma'tion
The Wood Canyon Formation (named by Nolan, 1929, p. 463-464) conformably overlies the Stirling Quartzite and is recognized throughout the Spring Mountains and Death Valley region. In the Bare ~fountain and Bullfrog. quadrangles (fig. 1), Cornwall and IGeinhampl (1964, p. J2-J3) have applied the name Daylight.Formation to the rocks here considered to be the Wood Canyon Formation. Use of the name Daylight Formation is confined to these quadrangles.
The Wood Canyon Formation is herein divided into three members, referred to informally as lower, middle, and upper members. The lower member consists of grayish-olive siltstone, 1ninor amounts of yellowishgray quartzite, and three prominent brown-weathering layers of dolomite. The dolomite beds are quite persistent and may extend throughout much of the area of distribution of the lower member.
The lower member of the Wood Canyon Formation is correlated (fig. 2) largely with the Deep Spring Formation of the White-Inyo Mountains facies. The Deep Spring Formation (named by Kirk, in Knopf, 1918, p. 24) is a heterogeneous sequence of quartzite, siltstone, calcareous sandstone, limestone, and dolomite. Three members are recognized in the Deep Spring Formation (Nelson, 1962b, p. 141; 1963) : a lower member consisting predominantly of limestone and dolomite; a middle member of quartzite with a limestone or dolomite unit at the 1top; and an upper member also of quartzite, with a limestone and dolomite unit at the top. The carbonate units at the top of the middle member and the top of the upper member of the Deep Spring Formation could be the same units as the upper two carbonate layers in the lower member of the Wood Canyon Formation (fig. 2). The Deep Spring Formation contains considerably more limestone and dolomite than the comparable part of the lower member of the Wood Canyon Formation.

The middle member of the Wood Canyon Formation consists of pale-red and grayish-red cross-stratified quartzite and minor amounts of siltstone. This member grades northwestward into finer clastic rocks that constitute the main part of the Campito Formation. The Campito Formation (named by Kirk, in Knopf, 1918, p. 27) consists of dark-greenish-gray to greenish-black, very fine grained quartzite and greenish-gray coarse siltstone, and is divided (Nelson, 1962b, p. 141) into a thick lower member-the Andrews Mountains Member-consisting dominantly of quartzite, and an upper member-the Montenegro Member -consisting dominantly of siltstone.
The upper member of the Wood Canyon Formation consists mostly of grayish-olive siltstone and yellowish-gray very fine grained quartzite. The quartzite commonly contains scraps of trilobites, and Scolithus tubes (worm borings) are common in both the quartzite and siltstone in the upper part of the member. The upper part also contains light-brown-weathering dolomite beds which are commonly oolitic and contain abundant plates of pelmatozoa. In the Echo Canyon, Bare Mountain, Titanothere Canyon, and southern Last Chance Range areas (sees. 8, 7, 6, and 5, fig. 2), limestone beds also are present in the upper part of the member; in these areas archeocyathids are found in the limestone near the base of the carbonate-bearing
part of the member. The lower part of the upper member of the Wood
Canyon Formation is correlated (fig. 2) with the upper part of the Campito Formation (at least in part with the Montenegro Member of the Campito) of the White-Inyo Mountains facies. The upper part of the upper member of the Wood Canyon that contains limestone and dolomite is correlated largely with the Poleta Formation. The Poleta Formation (named by Nelson, 1962b, p. 141-142) is divided into three members (Mcl{ee and Moiola, 1962, p. 534-535;
Stewart, 1965, p. A63): a lower member of archeocyathid-bearing limestone; a middle member of siltstone, quartzite, and minor amounts of limestone; and an upper member of limestone. Archeocyathids also occur, but are rare, in the upper member of the Poleta Formation. The archeocyathid-bearing limestone in the upper part of the Wood Canyon Formation in the Echo Canyon, Bare Mountain, Titanothere Canyon, and southern Last Chance Range areas appears to be a continuation of the archeocyathid-bearing limestone of the lower member of the Poleta Formation. The uppermost
part of the upper member of the Wood Canyon Formation may be correlated with the basal part of the Harkless Formation (fig. 2).

PALEONTOLOGY AND STRATIIGRAPHY

Zabrisk,ie Quartzite

As recently described by Nelson (1965), the upper

The Zabriskie Quartzite overlies the Wood Can- part of the Carrara Formation is correlative with the yon Formation and is recognized throughout the newly named Monola Formation of Middle Cambrian Spring Mountains-Death Valley region. The Za- age of the mite-Inyo Mountains area.

briskie Quartzite was described and named originally by Hazzard (1937, p. 309-310) as a member of the Wood Canyon Formation and has been raised to the rank of a formation by Wheeler (1948, p. 26) and Barnes and others (1965). In the Bare Mountain and Bullfrog quadrangles (fig. 1), Cornwall and Kleinhampl (1964, p. J3-J4) have applied the name Corkscrew Quartzite to the rocks here considered to be the Zabriskie Quartzite. Use of the name Corkscrew Quartzite is confined to these quadrangles.
The Zabriskie Quartzite is a homogeneol:ls sequence of. a pale-red fine- to coarse-grained quartzite. Some siltstone and micaceous quartzite transitional into the underlying 'Vood Canyon Formation are present at the base of the formation in some areas. The Zabriskie tongues out northwestward into the finer grained clastic rocks of the Harkless Formation and the lower part of the Saline Valley Formation. The Harkless Formation (named by Nelson, 1962b, p. 142) consists of grayish-olive siltstone interlayered with the fineto coarse-grained quartzite tongues of the Zabriskie. The Saline Valley Formation (named by Nelson~ 1962b, p. 142) 1s a laterally variable sequence of quartzite, sandstone, sandy limestone, limestone, and siltstone. The quartzite units in the lower part of the Saline Valley Formation are also considered to be tongues of the Zabriskie Quartzite. The amount of quartzite (tongues of the Zabriskie) in the Harkless and Saline Valley Formations decreased to the north in the mite-Inyo Mountains area, and the Harkless and Saline Valley Formations may be almost entirely siltstone in the northwest part of the mite-Inyo Mountains region (Nelson, written commun., 1962). The Harkless-Saline Valley equivalent in Esmeralda County, Nev. (Albers and Stewart, 1962, fig. 126.2), is also almost entirely siltstone.
Carrara Formation
The Carrara Formation (named by Cornwall and Kleinhampl, 1961) of the Spring Mountains-Death Valley facies consists of gray limestone, light-brownweathering silty limestone, and green siltstone. The lowermost part of this formation is correlative with the upper part of the Saline Valley Formation (fig. 2).

LOCAL THICKENING OF BASALTS AND LATE TERTIARY SILICIC VOLCANISM IN THE CANYON CITY QUADRANGLE, NORTHEASTERN OREGON
By T. P. THAYER and C. ERVIN BROWN, Washington, D.C.

Abstra.ct.-Tbickening of basalts of the Columbia River Group to 6,000 feet along the Monumept swarm of feeder dikes implies that the overlying Mnscall Formation probably was at least 6,000-7,000 feet thick at Picture Gorge. Over much of the present Canyon City quadrangle the Columbia River Group and stratigt·nr,bicnlly equivalent Strawberry Volcanics probably attained a thickness of 8,000 feet or more in early Pliocene time. 'rbe nature of the Mnscnll ]!"'ormation reflects the former existence of a thick regional cover of silicic volcanic rocl<:-5, only relntively thin remnants of which are preserved in isolated structural basins.
The basalts of the Columbia Plateau and the volcanic rocks of lVfiocene and early Pliocene age in the adjacent part of the Basin and Range province have for some time been known in a general way to interfinger or intergrade. Only in recent years, however, has enough of the border zone been mapped in sufficient detail to reveal a rather close correlation within the two provinces between composition of the rocks, type of volcanism, and later deformation in the region around ,John Day, in northeastern Oregon (Thayer, 1957). The Mascall Formation was first recognized in 1957 as a derivative of dacitic and rhyolitic eruptions that were coeval, at least partly, with basaltic flows from a system of fissures now represented by the Monument dike sw·arm. Since 1957, detailed mapping by R. E. 'Vi1cox and R. V. Fisher (in press), of the U.S. Geological Survey, and the authors (Brown and Thayer, in press; Thayer and Brown, 1966) has provided a basis for a much better understanding of the stratigraphy of the rocks and their rela6ons to the eruptive sources. Local thickening of basalts along the dike swarm, while interesting in itself, has indirect regionnJ implications of much greater import.
COLUMBIA RIVER GROUP
The Columbia River Group in the Canyon City quadrangle (Brown and Thayer, in press) includes the Picture Gorge Basalt and the overlying Mascall

Formation, which locally interfingers with the Picture Gorge. In the central and southern part of the area a rhyolitic marginal facies of the group comprises, in addition to basalts, interfingering rhyolitic flows and tuffs (fig. 1). The Strawberry Volcanics in the southeastern part of the quadrangle are equivalent in age to the Columbia River Group as a whole. The discussion here is concerned mainly with the units of the Columbia River Grou'p (Brown and Thayer, in press) which occur within 20-25 miles of Picture Gorge (fig. 2) . Some of the flows in the upper part of the thick basalt sections may be equivalent to the Yakima Basalt of the Columbia River Group in Washington. The petrology of the basalts has been described elsewhere (Waters, 1961, p. 594; Thayer and Brown, in press; Thayer, 1957), and is not of primary concern here. Likewise, the structural and stratigraphic relations of the Clarno and ,Jolm Day Formations, which underlie the group, are not pertinent to the present problem except where specifically referred to; the two formations have therefore been omitted from figure 2 for simplicity.
Picture Gorge Basalt and related· flows
At the type locality (fig. 2) the Picture Gorge Basalt consists of 14 flows, nearly equal in thickness, which together are about 1,500 feet thick; they lie on the John Day Formation (fig. 3). In the valley of Flat Creek 10 miles southeast of Picture Gorge (fig. 2) , a section that is 6,000 feet thick and comprises at least 50 basalt flows and 500 feet of intercalated bouldery gravels appears to be stratigraphically about equivalent to the Picture Gorge Basalt. The lower flows 'in the section appear identical with those at Pjcture Gorge, but the individual upper flows range from about 20 to 200 feet, .the flows have a much larger proportion of top and bottom breccia, and they 1nay be equivalent in part to the Yakima Basalt.

Exposures nearby show that the flows lie unconformably on the Clarno Formation (Thayer and Brown, 1966) and are conformable with the overlying Mascall Formation. Good exposures and the variations in lithology preclude duplication of

any parts of the section by faulting. Six miles east of Flat Creek the basalts are only 2,500 feet thick where they dip vertically between the Clarno and l\{ascall Formations. A conformable contact between the Mascall Formation and Picture Gorge Basalt is exposed south of the John Day fault 3 miles from the east edge of the map area (fig. 2), and north of the faul t the contact appears to be conformable every-

FIGURE 3.-Restored section along the John Day River valley (fig. 2, A-A'), showing inferred relations of the Mascall Formation (Tm) and basalts of the Columbia River Group (Tc) and Picture Gorge Basalt (Tp) in early Pliocene time. Datum is approximately the base of Picture Gorge Basalt at Picture Gorge; vertical exaggeration X 2.

where. Although the unconformable relations ~hown in figure 3 result from the vertical exaggeration of the section, such relationships should be expected where fine-grained water-laid sediments cover flows dipping away from the center of the ridge. Exposures, however, are not good enough to reveal angular discordances of the magnitude indicated.
Farther north, around the west side of Fox basin, the basalts of the group lie on the John Day Formation and dip gently eastward toward and under the basin filling of ~1ascall Formation. The total thickness of the basalt flows there probably is 1,200-1,500 feet. Near the northwest corner of the basin, where the rocks dip 4° (fig. 2), a 200-foot sequence of 4 basalt flows thins eastward ·within a mile to only 1 flow 15 feet thick, between water-laid tuffs. One or more thin basalt flows are interbedded with tuffs and gravels in the southwestern part of the basin, and along the southern margin basalts and interbedded bouldery conglomerates wedge out toward the center of the basin. The upper flows here may be equivalent to the Yakima Basalt.
Mascall Formation
The ~1ascall Formation consists mostly of lightcolored, water-laid, altered volcanic ash in which thin beds of well-rounded, polished pebble gravels are erratically distributed. Lignitic lenses as much as 5 feet thick have been exposed in roadcuts and in an old mine 4 to 5 miles east of Flat Creek. Most of the pebbles are of hard rocks such as chert, metavolcanic rocks, and intrusive rocks o£ pre-Tertiary age. The proportion of gravels and size of pebbles increase eastward, and some tuff probably of ash-flow origin is present near the east edge of the map area (fig. 2). The greatest known thickness of the Mascall Formation is 2,090 feet, measured ·south of Picture Gorge (~1erriam and others, 1925, p. 52) ; equal or greater thicknesses very probably are preserved farther east, but are concealed or complexly faulted.
Although the Mascall Formation in the John Day River valley is separated by a gap of 10 miles from

the nearest rocks of equivalent age to the east, their mutual relations can be traced by means of deposits in Fox basin and the Beech Creek graben (fig. 1). Lithologically, most of the deposits in the Fox basin are indistinguishable from those in the John Day Valley, although the conglomerates along the south side of the basin consist mostly of locally derived basaltic debris. In the Beech Creek graben 350 to 400 feet of pumice breccia and welded tuff with ~1ascall1ike gravel at the base overlies basalt flows and interfingers southeastward with basalt. Where the graben dies out to the southeast, the flows and tuffs in it merge with the rhyolitic marginal facies of the Columbia River Group. This f~tcies comprises basaltic and andesitic flows intercalated with rhyolitic water-laid debris, welded tuffs and thick lenticular rhyolite flows from local vents, and some conglomerate; it may be as much as 2,000 feet thick. The rhyolitic marginal facies, in turn, is separated from the Strawberry Volcanics (6,500 feet thick) by a 2-mile gap, but there is little doubt that the two units once interfingered (Thayer, 1957; Brown and Thayer, in press). The Mascall Formatioi1, therefore, is believed to have accumulated as a flood plain or piedmont apron that extended to the north and west out over the basalt plateau many miles from volcanoes that rimmed it on the south and east.
RATTLESNAKE FORMATION AND YOUNGER SEDIMENTARY DEPOSITS 1
The Rattlesnake Formation, of middle to late Pliocene age in this area (Merriam and others, 1925, p. 53; Brown and Thayer, in press), consists of fanglomerate and poorly sorted finer sediments, deposited under semiarid conditions in structural lowlands formed by post-Mascall erosion and deformation. A welded rhyolite tuff in the middle of the formation
11\iost of the Rattlesnake Formation and younger deposits have been left off the geologic map (fig. 2) to keep the map more readable at its present scale. The relationships of the Rattlesnake Formation are shown in Thayer and Brown (1966) and Brown and Thayer (in press).

forms prominent rimrocks along the John Day River valley. The maximum observed thickness of the Rattlesnake Formation in the John Day structural trough is about 700 feet at a section exposed just southeast of Dayville; the total thickness may be as much as 1,000 feet. The Rattlesnake lies unconformably across the Mascall Formation and Picture Gorge Basalt; in places it lies across the John Day fault, but elsewhere it is cut by the fault. Near the east edge of the map area (fig. 2) the Rattlesnake Formation appears to have been folded and faulted down about 1,000 feet below remnants of the welded tuff preserved on the rim of Picture Gorge. These relationships of the Rattlesnake Formation show that: (1) the Mascall Formation had been stripped completely frmn large areas by early middle Pliocene bme, and (2) the basalts in the Black Butte and Aldrich Mountain anticlines have been exposed to erosion continuously since then.
ORIGINAL THICKNESS OF THE COLUMBIA RIVER G'ROUP IN THE F'LAT CREEK-PICTURE GORGE AREA
The thick section of basalt along Flat Creek and its relation to the Mascall Formation provide a unique measure for the minimum original thickness of the l\{ascall Form:ttion and, consequently, of the Columbia River Group. The local variations in thickness of the basalts in the map area are believed to be related to the Monument dike swarm (Thayer, 1957, p. 234; Waters, 1961, p. 587) as their principal sOtirce. The thickest preserved section of the flows is directly on strike with the numerous feeder dikes in the Aldrich Mountains. The abundance of flow breccia and the thinness of the upper flows in Flat Creek indicate thn,t a high ridge was buHt up along the pre~ent trend of the l\ionument dike swarm; the great thickness is not due to ponding of highly fluid flows in a low area. If the base of the basalts is assumed to have been horizontn,], 4,500 feet of relief is indicated 011 their surface between Picture Gorge and Flat Creek, and 3,500 feet between Flat Creek and the area 6 miles to the east (fig. 3). The topographic relief of the ridge probably never exceeded a few hundred feet. The basftlts, however, buried a surface that had a local relief of at least 2,000 feet, so their base may have been significantly higher on the Clarno Formation at Flat Creek than on the soft John Day Formation (Fisher, 1963) ftt Picture Gorge. Interfingering of basalts with the M:tsca11 Formation in the Fox basin would result :from eruptions neftr the dikes now exposed in the head of Cottonwood Creek. The 1,2001,400 feet of basnJt west of Fox basin suggests a sheet of uniform thickness frmn there at least as far ftS PiCJture

Gorge, but this is misleading. As indicated previously, the basalts around the head of Cottonwood Creek have been exposed to erosion since early middle Pliocene time, so they represent only part of the original section. The marked local decrease in thickness from 1,400 feet to 500 feet north of the Black Butte ttnticline is due to a combination of relief on the prebasalt surface and erosion of the basalt. Farther n<?rth, in the IGmberly-:-Monument area, the original thickness of the basalt is not known, but about 2,000 feet of flows remains in a shallow syncline east of IGmberly.
The stratigraphic relations around Fox basin show that Mascall deposition began while fissure eruptions were still building up the ridge, but along the present line of the John Day River the lava ridge must have stood above the Mascall until basaltic eruptions ceased; this i1nplies that the crest of the ridge sloped northward. The known thickness of l\{ascall immediately north of the John Day fault on a small horst in the vicinity of Flat Creek is 800-1,000 feet, and the thickness remaining in nearby grabens is probably at least twice as much. An assumed thickness of 1,-500-2,000 feet of Mascall originally covering the basalts is believed to be conservative. It seems likely, therefore, that the Columbia River Group was 7,500-8,000 feet thick in the Flat Creek-Picture Gorge area, with the relative proportions of 1\{ascall Formation and basalt reversed at the two 1ocalities (see fig. 3) .
MAGNITUDE OF LATE MIO·CENE AND EARLY ·PLIOCENE SILICEOUS VOLCANISM
If our conceptions of the original volcanic topography of the Picture Gorge and Yakima Basalts are at, all valid, and the estim~tes of the thickness of the l\{ascall Formation at Picture Gorge are anywhere near correct, the original volume of the Mascall must have been many hundreds of cubic miles. The Mascall Formation proper should be regarded as a mixture of some ash-fall material with the fluviatile debris carried away from centers of e.xplosive volcanic activity around the margins of the basalt plateau. The remaining. predominantly basaltic and andesitic flows in the Columbia River Group and Strawberry Volcanics are only the lower part of the original volcanic section, and therefore are not necessarily representative of the entire section, especially of the upper part which has vanished.. Rhyolitic to dacitic flows and fragmental rocks form an important part of the marginal facies of the Columbia, River Group, and are especially abundant in the Strawberry Volcanics between Strawberry l\{ountain and Bear Valley (Brown and Thayer, in press). One important center of

Deposits preserved in Unity basin (fig. 1) imply that the Mascall Formation probably was even thicker than the Flat Creek section suggests. The bedded section in the Unity basin is several hundred to a few thousand feet thick, and has yielded several species of lower Pliocene vertebrate fossils (J. A. Shotwell, written commun., 1956). Along the western edge of the basin the beds interfinger with basalts of th1~ Strawberry Volcanics, and obsidian flow breccia is interbedded along the southern margin. During the early Pliocene, while the eruptive centers in the vicinity of Strawberry and Lookout Mountains were shedding debris northeastward and northwestward, other centers south of the present Aldrich Mountains (fig. 2) were sources of materials that probably moved northward and westward. Absence of Pliocene fossils in the Mascall can be explained by removal of the higher parts of the original section, which may have substantially exceeded the estimated thickness of 6,000-6,500 feet.
There now remains little doubt that volcanic rocks equivalent in age to the Columbia River Group blanketed the entire Blue Mountain region to the northeast, and buried all the older rocks. Restoration of the early Pliocene surface by undoing all the post-Mascall deformation would reduce the pre-Columbia relief in the region well below the inferred thickness of the Columbia River Group. The region is envisioned, therefore, as having been a volcanic plateau above which r()se eruptive centers, like the cluster in the vicinity of Strawberry and Lookout Mountains, (fig. 1) (Brown and Thayer, in press). The Mascall Formation and deposits of the same age in Bear Valley and in the Unity and Paulina basins, we believe, all merged in one extensive volcanic sheet. The upper deposits appear to have been stripped before the basins reached their ultimate depth, just as the Mascall was eroded before final sinking of the John Day valley structural trough. The stratigraphic relationships of the Mascall Formation to the upper basalt flows of the Columbia River Group are believed to have been like those described by Waters (1961, p. 606) between the Yakima Basalt and Ellensburg Formation, 150 miies northwest of the report area.
The relations postulated for the Canyon City quadrangle (fig. 2) in early Pliocene time are comparable to those now obtaining in the region around Crater Lake and Newberry crater in west-central Oregon (vVells and Peck, 1961). ,There, the extensive pumice blankets and dacitic products from Quaternary erup-

tions··-would be removed first ~by prolong~d ·erosion, along with the higher silicic parts of the cones. The resistant rocks that remained would consist largely of the andesitic and basaltic flows of the High Cascades and the more massive flow sequences in the plateau to the east.
In conclusion, the fluviatile deposits similar to the Mascall Formation which are preserved in various structural basins in the Canyon City quadrangle might be compared to puddles left after a flood. The depth of a flood is measured, not by the depth of the puddles, but by high-water marks. Although it does not preserve the actual "high water" mark of the flood of debris that constituted the Mascall Formation, the 6,000-foot basalt section in Flat Creek, like a mudcovered boulder, provides information on the minimum height of the flood. The inferred original 6,0007,000-foot thickness of the Mascall Formation at Picture Gorge implies a much more massive outpouring of silicic volcanic products in late Miocene and early Pliocene time around the southern edge of the Colum.bia Plateau than their present remnants would suggest. The northern limit of the original Mascall Formation can only be conjectured.

FORAMINIFERA .FROM THE ARCTIC OCEAN OFF THE EASTERN SIBERIAN COAST
By RUTH TODD and DORIS LOW, Washington, D.C.

Abstract.-A composite fauna of 56 species of Foraminifera is recorded from bottom sediments of the continental shelf along the Arctic coast of eastern Siberia. The fauna is impoverished, most of the specimens belonging in Elphidiu/m, Buccella., Oass'i(l1f,Una, and various agglutinated genera, and there are many aberrant individuals. Nearly all the species are previously lmown Arctic inhabitants, and about half are also lmown in the Antarctic. The brackish-water species Trochananf1Mt,la jisstwa,1wrta occurs off the mouths of large Siberian rivers.
Foraminifera from various coasts and islands of the Arctic Ocean have been studied in considerable detail and are fairly well known (Brady 1881; Norvang, 1945; Cushman, 1948; Phleger, 1952; Loeblich and Tappan, 1953; Jarke, 1960; Mayer, 1962; Stschedrina, 1962; Cooper, 1964; Nagy, 1965). However, .since a 1901 expedition that collected 3 samples in the Laptev Sea and 3 from north of the New Siberian Islan~s (Awerinzew, 1911), nothing has been published on the Foraminifera of the shallow shelf along the eastern part of the Arctic coast of Siberia. To the west of this area, the Foraminifera in upper Tertiary and Quaternary sediments in some boreholes taken in the lower reaches of the Yenisey Valley, and in a few seabottom cores taken in the estuary of the Yenisey River and in the J(ara Sea off the mouth of this river, are reported by Zagorskaya and others (1965, fig. 2, tables 9-21). The impoverished fauna resulting from subnormal marine conditions on the shallow shelf beneath the Laptev, East Siberian, and Chukchi Seas provides an interesting comparison with the better known Arctic Foraminifera.
THE NO,RTHWIND TRAVERSE
In the late summer of 1963, the USCG cutter North'Wind ('~TAGB-282) traversed the eastern part of the northern coast of S~beria as far west as long 115° E. Entering the Arctic Ocean through Bering Strait, the

expedition sailed through the Chukchi Sea, the East Siberian Sea, behind the New Siberian Islands, around the delta of the Lena River, and into the Laptev Sea, nearly to the Taimur Peninsula which separates the Laptev Sea from the Kara Sea farther westward. The area traversed extends from about long 168° W. to long 115° E. between lat 65° and 76° N.
These offshore areas of eastern Siberia consist of a shallow shelf having less-than-normal marine salinity even in the bottom water (Zenkevitch, 1963, p. 255269) . In the western part of this area, water from the Arctic Ocean floods up onto the coastal shelf while the fresh-water discharge of the large Siberian rivers-the Khatanga, Lena, and Yana-spreads out over the Arctic bottom water for as much as several hundred miles. To the east, Pacific waters enter over the shallow threshold of Bering Strait and circulate within the Chukchi Sea (Zenkevitch, 1963, text fig. 111).
ENVIRONMENTAL EFFECTS ON FO~RAMINIFERA
From data obtained by the N orth'Wind and supplied by the National Oceanographic Data Center, we have summarized below certain environmental conditions that probably affect and may in part control the local d·istribution of Foraminifera over the region studied. The N orthwilnd cruise corroborates by specific data the general statements of Zenkevitch (1963) regarding the dilution of the surface waters by river outflow.
Table 1 gives the observed range and mean of salinity and temperature of surface water and bottom water at the oceanographic stations from which our samples came.
We have grouped the samples into four categories on the basis of reiative abundance (11 rich samples, 19 good to fair s~mples, 46 poor samples, and 26 barren samples) to facilitate seeking a correlation between richness or sparseness of the Foraminifera fauna and

never more than 4 meters above the bottom) for these groups of samples.
we conclude that extremely low salinity inhibits the development of these Foraminifera faunas but that Foraminifera do not occur in all samples where the salinity is normal. Undoubtedly many factors other than salinity affect the local development of Foraminifera faunas along this shallow shelf sea; it may even be that distribution. is haphazard, without controlling environmental influences.

A small portion ('about 20 ml) of each of 105 samples, from nearly 200 samples dredged by the Northrwind between August 7 and September 11, was selected for examination for Foraminifera (table 3). In 26 of the 105 samples no identifiable Foraminifera were

observed. However, in some of these barren samples, as well as in most of the others, various kinds of organic remains were observed. Among these remains are diatoms, ostracodes, minute pelecypods and gastropods, bryozoans, indeterminate spicules, calcareous plates, worm tubes, fish teeth, arenaceous tubes of indeterminate origin, and possibly plant material.
The 79 Foraminifera-bearing samples yielded a com~ posite fauna of 56 identified species (plus 5 or 6 additional indeterminate ones), but the maximum number of species present in any individual sample is 19. The 1nean number of species per sample is 4.6, as compared with the following mean numbers per sample at comparable depths in other Arctic regions : 27 around Point Barrow (Loeblich and Tappan, 1953, table 1), and 18 in the Canadian Arctic (Phleger, 1952, table 1). The range of depth at which the samples were taken is 10 to 55 meters, and the maximum distance from shore is about 175 miles.
The Foraminifera fauna is an impoverished one consisting of few specimens, fewer species than is normal for Arctic assemblages, and specimens mostly smaller and less well developed than normal for the species. Its elements consist chiefly of arenaceous genera and of species of the calcareous genus Elz}hidi'l.mn. No planktonic Foraminifera were observed. In some samples, specimens are fragmentary as if their calcareous tests had been leached, although no pH readings were low enough to suggest acidic bottom water.
We noted no correlation between bottom type (sandy or muddy) and type of assemblage (predominantly arenaceous or calcareous) . There seems to be no distinct pattern of richness or barrenness of samples, nor any preferred association of species with one another. In some samples the entire assemblage is composed of a single species or not more than three species. For example, sample 189 contained only Ammotium cassis (25 specimens), and sample 149 contained 51 specimens of A. cassis and 1 of Adercotryrna gl01nerat1.tn-~t, but nothing else. Distribution appears to be haphazard for most species; possibly they exist in small transitory colonies.
Freak or aberrant specimens were observed with a frequency unexpectedly high for Foraminifera. High
frequency of aberrant individuals is usually attributed
to unfavorable habitats, such as low salinity, stag-
nant water, and large seasonal variation in water con-
ditions. Arnal (1955), in seeking abnormal specimens,
found high frequencies in Playa del Rey, a stagnant
coastal lagoon, and in the Salton Sea around areas of
fresh-water influx. On Martha's Vineyard we found a
comparable high frequency of aberrant individuals of

Elphidium gunteri in a pond, under conditions of restricted circulation where the temperature was higher and the salinity lower than normal (Todd and Low, 1961, p. 19). In a Miocene brackish-water deposit in the Mainz basin of Germany, aberrant individuals of a species of N onio1n and of a species of Bolivina are interpreted as a response to a habitat that was becoming progressively fresher (Bik, 1964~ p. 72).
The following species were found as major constituents in the three seas (Chukchi, East Siberian, and Laptev) traversed by theNorthwilnd. (In this analysis

we have included the samples from behind the New Siberian Islands with those from the East Siberian
Sea.):
Ammotium cassis (Parker) Eggerella advena (Cushman) Elphidium clavatum Cushman E. imcertum (Williamson) E. orbiculare (Brady) Reophaw {]Urtus Cushman R. scorpiurus Montfort
Also present in all three seas, but more rarely and with more scattered records, are:
Buccella frigida ·(Cushman) Oassidulina islan.dica Norvang PseudopolymorphiM novangliae, (Cushman) Quitnqueloculina agglutinata Cushman Rhabdammina aff. R. discreta Brady
The following species were found as significant though not abundant elements, restricted to the Chukchi Sea and absent from the other two seas :
Buccella inusitata Andersen Oibicides lobatul!us (Walker and Jacob) Elphidium bartletti Cushman Eponides wrightii (Brady) Oolina borealis Loeblich and Tappan Pseudononion. auricula (Heron-Allen and Earland) Reophaw arcticus Brady Trochammina squamata Parker and Jones
Four additional species are also significant components of the Chukchi Sea fauna, but each has 1, 2, or 3 rare occurrences in the Laptev Sea :
Elphidiella arotioa (Parker and Jones) Elphidium frigidum Cushman Recurvoides turbinatus (Brady) Spirople(}tammina biformis (Parker and Jones)
No significant species appear to be restricted to the East Siberian Sea, but several species were found only in the East Siberian and Laptev Seas together:
Elphidiella groenlamdica (Cushman) S accammina longioollis (Wiesner) Tewtularia torquata Parker Trochammina nana (Brady) T. rotalif01WIJ.is Wright Trochamminula fissurape.rta Stschedrina Two species, both rare, were found in the Laptev Sea but not elsewhere in the present collections. Oassidulima teretis Tappan Hippoorepina indivisa Parker
The remaining 28 species, about half of the composite fauna, fail to show any significant distribution patterns or are too rare to be of significance.

Most of the species are known elsewhere from nearshore and cold environments. Table 4 (p. C84-C85) lists the identified species and includes the record of occurrence and estimate of abundance for each species and each sa1nple. It also includes information regarding other reported occurrences. Starred species in this table are those considered to have been living when collected, as determined by rose bengal stain in six selected san1ples (Walton, 1952).
Only four of the identified species have not already been reported from the Arctic regions. Two of them, S accan1llnina longicollis and N ouria polymorrphilnoides, have been reported from the Antarctic. The other two, lJ[a'rgi'fllulina glabra and Rosalina ornatissima, are cold-water species that have not previously been reported in the Arctic.
The present fauna falls into Stschedrina's sublittoral group of species, which she describes as characteristic of depths that are less than 50 meters, have seasonal temperature fluctuations, and within which salinity is reduced by influx of fresh water (Stschedrina, 1959). The 1najor species in this cold water sublittoral group are reported by her to be Hippoc?·epina indivisa, Reophax <Jurtus, Spiroplectammina bifo1·1nis, and Trochan1llninula fissuraperta.
The most interesting of these species is Trocham'1ninula fissu1·a1Jerta. The genus was described as being distributed in shallow depths, along the Siberian coast from the Barents Sea to the Chukchi Sea, and in the Okhotsk and Bering Seas. In our material it is found only off the mouths of the Lena and Yana Rivers, which empty into the eastern part of the Laptev Sea. In its morphology the genus seems only questionably distinguishable from Areno1Jarrella. ArenolJa?-rella mexicana occurs widely under equivalent ecological conditions, except for temperature, at numerous marsh and brackish localities along the Gulf Coast of the United States, around Trinidad, on the south shore of Cape Cod, off southern California and Baja California, and even off the Asiatic coast in the southwestern Yellow Sea.

AGE OF THE UNCOMPAHGRE UPLIFT AND UNAWEEP CANYON, WEST-CENTRAL COLORADO
By FRED W. CATER, Denver, Colo.

Abstract.-Unaweep Canyon, a wind gap that crosses the Uncompahgre Plateau, is an uplifted and deserted channel that ancient river gravels and physiographic relations indicate was occupied by the Gunnison River, rather than the Colorado River as believed by some earlier investigators. Tentative dating of fanglomerates overlying the ancient river gravels indicates

about 4 miles northeast of Gateway along the southwest flank of the uplift the formation abruptly pinches out between the unconformably overlying Triassic Chinle Formation and underlying Precambrian crystalline rocks. It is for this reason that the bottom of

the Gunnison River probably abandoned Unaweep Canyon in early Pleistocene or latest Pliocene time. Uplift of the Uncompahgre Plateau totals more than 2,000 feet, of which about 1,300 to 1,400 feet occurred after Unaweep Canyon was abandoned. Uplift probably started no earlier than mid-Pliocene. Since Unaweep Canyon has been abandoned the trunk streams

GEOMORPHOLOGY

1965, p.' 72-74) has dealt most comprehensively with these problems, but since completion of his studies, new occurrences of ancient river gravels have been found and certain fanglomerates have been tentatively dated. Although the new evidence confirms many of Lohman's conclusions, the conclusions herein presented differ from both his and my earlier conclusions (Cater, 1955), principally in denying that the Colorado River carved Unaweep Canyon and in recognizing a greater amount of uplift of the Uncompahgre Plateau since the abandonment of Unaweep Canyon. Of greater geologic significance, however, is a difference in viewpoint concerning the timing of uplift. In both Lohman's (1965, p. 91) and Hunt's (1956, p. 73-85) view the Uncompahgre uplift started near the beginning of Tertiary time, and renewed uplift has occurred periodically since then, including a late pulse of uplift after Unaweep Canyon was abandoned. In my view, the Uncompahgre uplift became a distinct structural feature only in late Tertiary time, when it rose on the northeast side of the Colorado Plateaus province which to the southwest was structurally much higher. Probably uplift occurred as a more or less continuous, single event; during the earlier stages of uplift Unaweep Canyon was deepened, and later, after the downcutting river abandoned it, the canyon was elevated. It is the purpose, then, of this paper to reexamine the history of the canyon and the uplift in the light of the new evidence, and to present the following conclusions: (1) Unaweep Canyon was carved by the Gunnison River, and the Colorado River never flowed through it; (2) Unaweep Canyon was abandoned in late Pliocene time; (3) the rise of the modern Uncompahgre uplift probably began in midor late Pliocene time; and (4) almost all the difference in altitude between the Dolores River at Gateway and the floor of Unaweep Canyon is the result of uplift.
The assumption that Unaweep Canyon is the abandoned channel of the Colorado River has been based largely on the alinement of the canyon with the course of the Colorado River above Grand Junction. Reasons for believing otherwise are based on the following lines of evidence: (1) The composition of the gravels deposited by the stream that cut the canyon; (2) the small size and different topographic characteristics of the valley of East Creek north of Cactus Peak as compared with Unaweep Canyon and the old channel of the Gunnison in and southeast of Cactus Park; and (3) the rerouted post-Unaweep course of the Gunnison River, which is inconsistent with a Colorado River that formerly flowed through Unaweep Canyon.

Gravels
The best indication of the identity of a stream that cut a now-deserted channel is the composition of the gravels left behind. The Colorado and Gunnison Rivers drain areas of strongly contrasting rock types, and this contrast is reflected by the difference in composition of their gravels. The Gunnison River drains a considerable part of the San Juan Mountains and the West Elk Mountains volcanic fields, and as a consequence its gravels consist predominantly of peb~l~s of intermediate and silicic volcanic and porphyritic intrusive rocks, and they also contain a wide variety of Precambrian, Paleozoic, and Mesozoic rocks. Basalt pebbles, particularly vesicular varieties, are not abundant. Gravels of the Dolores River are similar to those of the Gunnison except for a lack of basalt pebbles. Colorado River gravels, on the other ha~1d, are characterized by abundant basalt pebbles of winch many are vesicular. Only the most durable of Precambrian and Paleozoic rocks have survived as pebbles, and pebbles of volcanic and porphyritic intrusive rocks other than basalt are rare.
Ancient river gravels newly exposed in roadcuts (fig. 2) along State Highway 141, 1 to 4 miles northeast of Gateway, and gravels from Unaweep Canyon later reworked and deposited by West Creek contain numerous pebbles of intermediate and silicic volcanie and porphyritic intrusive rocks but only a few of basalt, a composition that strongly suggests a Gunnison River rather than a combined Colorado-Gunnison River source.

CATER

It could be argued, of course, that gravels deposited by the Colorado River had been swept from the canyon after the Colorado was captured and before the Gunnison was diverted. Such a possibility seems unlikely, however, because in Cactus Park river gravels are preserved in a terrace more than 100 feet above the bed of the ancient river, and, as will be explained later, capture of the Colorado River should have been followed almost immediately by diversion of the Gunnison down the abandoned channel.
Topographic features
The second reason for believing that the Colorado River never flowed through Unaweep Canyon is that the valley of East Creek becomes much smaller and topographically different once it leaves Unaweep Canyon below Cactus Park. In Cactus Park and Unaweep Canyon the floor of the ancient channel is broad and flat; below Cactus Park the valley of East Creek is relatively narrow and the floor slopes rather steeply and irregularly to the creek. A topographic break, therefore, occurs in the valley of East Creek below Cactus Park; the valley above preserves the appen,rance of a relatively unmodified channel of a large river and that below preserves the appearance of a canyon cut by a minor stream and never occupied by a large river. No residual river gravels have been found on the slopes and shoulders of this segment of

East Creek valley; their presumed absence supports this argument.
Present course of Gunnison River
The third reason, in part corollary to the second, is the present course of the Gunnison River southeast of Whitewater. Had the Colorado River entered Unaweep Canyon from East Creek valley at Cactus Park, then the Gunnison should have been captured through this same channel shortly after it had been abandoned by the Colorado (fig. 3). Reversal of drainage down this abandoned channel, which was aided, incidentally, by northeasterly tilting of the channel on the rising Uncompahgre uplift, would have required far less cutting through a shorter distance by a capturing strea1n than by any other route. The modern course of the Gunnison River above Whitewater would have required the river's capture by a stream that not only had to cut headward much farther in order to tap the Gunnison at its point of eventual capture more than 10 miles southeast of Cactus Park, but also in the process had· to cross a very considerable spur ridge that separated the two streams. As a matter of fact, the stream that captured the Gunnison cut headward from Grand Junction for about 25 miles along the northeast flank of the Uncompahgre Plateau before tapping the Gunnison; it then crossed the presumed abandoned course of the Colorado River (fig. 4). A stream capable of cutting an unwavering course head-

ward across the abandoned channel of a far larger stream without turning either up or down the old channel must at least be credited with an unusual degree of enterprise and singleness of purpose. Furthermore, as will be shown later, the Dolores River at Gateway has downcut only about 100 feet since the Gunnison River deserted Unaweep Canyon. Inasmuch as the Uncompahgre uplift, cored by granite, was rising across the courses of both the Colorado and Gunnison Rivers northeast of the uplift it is unlikely that they have downcut farther than the Dolores. Because the Gunnison River is trapped on the rising flank of the uplift, however, it has carved a deeper canyon. Both the Gunnison and Colorado Rivers are 300 to 500 feet below the dissected pediment that any possible channel of the Colorado River must have crossed north of Whitewater had it once flowed through Unaweep .Canyon, and no trace of such a channel exists. Therefore, it is concluded that the Colorado River never occupied Unaweep Canyon.
AGE OF ABANDONMENT OF UNAWEEP CANYON
Dating the abandonment of Unaweep Canyon is still subject to some uncertainty, but sediments that overlie the ancient river gravels northeast of Gateway permit establishing a minimum age. The open valley of West Creek between Gateway and the lower end of Unaweep Canyon at the southwest front of the Uncompahgre Plateau has been blanketed by two sequences of fanglomerates. Both fanglomerates cap low ridges sloping toward the creek, but where they

are in mutual contact an erosional unconformity separates the two. The older fanglomerate attains a maximum thickness of more than 200 feet. It consists of a light-red to buff unsorted mixture of silt, sand, gravel, and angular cobbles and boulders derived almost entirely from the Mesozoic formations that rim the valley. The material is fairly well consolidated and where cut by rapidly eroding gullies it stands as nearly vertical bluffs approaching 100 feet in height. This fanglomerate overlies the old river gravels northeast of Gateway, and hence was deposited after the Gunnison River abandoned Unaweep Canyon. The younger fanglomerate is similar to the older in all respects except that it is unconsolidated and contains large quantities of material derived from Precambrian rocks and the Permian Cutler Formation in the canyon walls.
These fanglomerates in lower West Creek valley are believed to correlate with the Pleistocene Harpole Mesa Formation described by Richmond (1962) in the nearby La Sal Mountains in Utah. Richmond divided this formation into three members which he tentatively correlated with the Nebraskan, Kansan, and Illinoian Glaciations of the Midwestern States. The middle 1nember of this formation contains an ash bed that Wilcox and Powers (in Richmond, 1962, p. 34-35) classed as a probable correlative of the Kansas Pearlette Ash ~1ember of the Sappa Formation of the Great Plains. The fanglomerates in the lower valley

cause structural and topographic displacement of the Uncompahgre Plateau coincide; that is, the plateau

Diversion of the Gunnison River from Unaweep Canyon happened early in the history of the present Uncompahgre uplift; dating the diversion therefore fixes roughly the beginning of uplift. Some earlier efforts at dating the beginning of uplift have placed it too fai· back. Hunt (1956, p. 73, 75) and Lohman (1965, p. 91), for example, suggest that uplift may have started in the Paleocene. Early dates probably were inferred because the faulted monocline marking the northeast front of the uplift coincides with the upper part of the great homocline that separates the Piceance Basin from the structurally much higher region to the southwest. The basin began forming, and consequently also the homocline, in earliest Tertiary tin1e (J. R. Donnell, oral commun., 1965), and the homocline has been tilted periodically since then. Early tilting of. the homocline, accordingly, has been confused with early rise of the Uncompahgre uplift. The southwest flank of the uplift, however, indicates the uplift is a separate structural feature rising from the crestal part of the most northeasterly of a series

surface is eroded to only about the same stratigraphic level as the mesa lands to the southwest, which are more than 2,000 feet lower. This condition would not be likely to exist had uplift occurred in the distant past, particularly so because the sedimentary rocks capping the plateau in the vicinity of Unaweep Canyon are relatively soft. It is concluded that uplift began no earlier than the mid-Pliocene and probably continued into the Pleistocene.
Another problem solved by the exposure of the ancient river gravels northeast of Gateway is the amount of downcutting by the Dolores River since Unaweep Canyon was abandoned. Prior to the uncovering of these gravels in a roadcut, it was a question of how much of the difference in elevation between the floor of Unaweep Canyon and the Dolores River at Gateway was the result of uplift and how much the result of downcutting by the river. Indirect although fairly convincing evidence indicated down-
cutting had been minor, but the gravels indicate it could not exceed 200 feet, the height of the lowermost

Paricutin still provides an advantageous natural laboratory for studying the recovery of land devastated by lava and ash. Continued studies of this volcano and its surroundings are particularly appropriate because observations and records since the end of the eruption in 1952 have been exceptionally complete. In 1960, Pa.ricutin and its surroundings were still strongly out of adjustment with the erosional and vegetal environment of the region (Beaman, 1961; Eggler, 1963; Segerstrom, 1961). By 1965, however, an approach toward stability was evident in all the devastated area: the cinder cone, the lava field with its associated ponded areas, and the su1·rounding ashcovered terrain (fig. 1). This progress toward recovery is describe~ here in the light of earlier conditions.

slope (figs. 1 and 2) were similar in 1965 and 1957; on the northwestern slope, the fans extended lower in 1965 than they did in 1957. A wide area without lapilli fans existed on the southwestern and northern sides in 1957 and 1965. The persistence of fans and of fan- free areas suggests that the cone has been relatively stable in the past 8 years; in contrast, fans had been highly ephemeral when the volcano was active in 1946 (Segerstrom, 1950, p. 28-30).
An ascent of the crater on June 11, 1965, revealed little change in its various features since February 24, 1957 (Segerstrom, 1960, p. 3). The rim of the cone still had an east peak and a slightly higher west peak. The lowest part of the interior, about 40-50 meters below the southwest rim, was separated from a more shallow depression to the northeast by a saddle about 20 m high. Large blocks of agglomerate that rested in apparently unstable positions on the north and east inner walls in 1957 had not moved much by 1965 (compare fig. 3 top with fig. 3 bottmn). One dif-

the 1957 ascent, but they were not observed on the day of the 1965 ascent.
Dissection of the Paricutin cone has not yet begun, and comparison of its form and surface with those of nearby cinder cones of greater age suggests that erosion will not be apparent for at least another century. Rill erosion had not started on the sides of the cone by 1965 ; the pyroclastic material of the cone is still too coarse and too permeable to permit surface flow of rainwater. With the passage of time, however, as soil which is less permeable than this material accumulates, the outer slopes of Paricutin will eventually become furrowed-like those of the 200-year old Jorullo cinder cone, approximately 100 kilometers to the southeast. Inasmuch as the inner slopes of the crater of Paricutin are comparatively coarse, it is unlikely that
water erosion will be evident there even after 200 years. Such is the situation at J orullo (Segerstrom, 1950, p. 140). However, Cutzato crater (61h km eastnortheast of Paricutin) which is perhaps a thousand

found in the crater, particularly at fissures on the east and south walls. In a few places the sublimate had n. reddish tinge, particularly on the south inner wall. The sublimates are probably ammonium chloride with variable amounts of iron chloride (Fries and Gutierrez, 1954, p. 492).
Vegetation on the cone was much better established in some places in 1965 than it had been in 1960 (Beaman, 1961); in other places little change was noted. A large area within the crater, about 20 m below the north rim, was almost completely covered with grass on June 11, 1965. Plants collected along the south rim by the author that day included a small shrub, Pernettya mewicana Camp, which had not been previously collected at Paricutin by Beaman1 nor mentioned by Eggler (1963). Other signs of life seen on the rim in 1965 included an oak leaf (windborne) , spiders, and moths. A few mosses, but no vascular plants, grew on the south outer slope of the cone 1n 1965-the only slope that was examined closely.

VEGETATION AND FUMAROLES ON THE LAVA FIELD

On the lava field, observations were made of the

increase of plant life between 1960 and 1965, and of

surviving fumaroles. Overlapping lavas of several

ages had flowed from Paricutin, partly concurrently

with eruptions of ash, and the development of a cover

of vegetation in various parts of the lava field is to

some extent dependent on local differences in amounts

of superimposed ash from direct fall and time avail-

able for invasion by plants.2

Considerable ash fell on early flows, and very little

... on late flows. Because the late flows are near the cone
and cover most of the early flows, very little of the

exposed lava field has a heavy blanket of ash. Most

of the Paricutin lava is of the aa, or blocky, type, and

it forms a jagged surface (fig. 2.) The establishing

of vegetation on such a surface depends on the presence

of crevices and of ash which has partly or wholly

filled them. Erosion and sedimentation by floods,

caused by rapid drainage of water impounded by lava,

are other factors affecting recovery.

Progressive establishment of vegetation of the lava

GE.OMORPHOLOGY

1960, Eggler was able to compile a list of 33 species of plants that were present on the 1944, 1945, and 1950 flows. This list included 2 gymnosperms, 9 angiosperm shrubs or small trees, 6 angiosperm· herbs, 12 ferns, and 4 mosses (Eggler, 1963, table 4). Ac. cording' to Eggler, plants on the flows were usually in crevices and depressions, with a greater number of kinds of plants on the 1944 flow, in the northern part of the lava field. "Crevices were farther apart on the 1944 flow ana hence collected more water and more ash" (Eggler, 1963, p. 55-57).
By 1965, most rock crevices in the north part of the lava field had mosses, many had ferns, and a few had shrubs and even pine trees. The largest pines were 21;2-3 m high. C~evices in the south part of the field were still very sparsely vegetated; however, both the north and south parts had a few scattered shrubs and pines on ash-covered areas at that time. Plants already established by 1960 continued to survive. Since 1960, at least two new ferns had appeared in the north part of the lava field (1944 flow): Polypodi~tm plebejum Schlect. and Cham., and Polypodium thyssanolepis A. Br.
Residual heat in the lava inhibited plant growth at some places. In June 1965, hot spots still existed at the surface of flows, even near the outer edges of the lava field; they were especially evident near the Llano de Tip6racuaro. During times of cool and humid atmospheric conditions, vapor cohunns rose from fumaroles in the lava. The largest and most persistent of these were on the Nueva Juatita lava-vent mound, on the northeast side of the cone, and on the Puertecito and Ahuan lava-vent mounds on the southwest side (fig. 1).
PONDED AREAS ASSOCIATED WITH LAVA FIELD
Ponded areas that border the lava field and extend into. some of its lowest parts have been the first ones near the volcano to become productive again. They were formed when lava flows filled the main valley at the head of the west-flowing Rio Itzicuaro, causing the blocking of preexisting drainage and redeposition of ash and eroded soil. The principal lava-blocked areas of deposition, called "playas" by Eggler (1948, 1959), are the Llanos de Tip6racuaro, Curupichu, Tipacua, Ch6rotiro and Terupicua, and Llano Grande (fig. 1).
The lakelike Llano de Tip6racuaro (pictured in Segerstrom, 1960, fig. 8, but not by name) is floored with a basin-fill deposit washed in from the south and dammed by the lava field. A relatively small alluvial fan at the east end formed a low divide, about 3 m high in 1957 and 1965, and prevented drainage into a

barranca that closely follows the eastern edge of the lava field. As recently as 1960 the northern end of the flat plain was flooded during each heavy rain. In 1965 the floodwater escaped through a depression that was 12 m across and 31;2 m deep and had caving sides, into underlying lava from Paricutin (fig. 2, bottom). A new gully from the west cut through th_e fill deposit to the depression. The depression did not exist in 1957, but at that time a hole 1 m deep in a different part of the basin allowed some floodwater to filter into the lava (fig. 2, top). This hole had disappeared by 1965. The basin fill has a large component of preexisting soil and has been a suitable site for plants since before 1957. Because of the periodic flooding, agriculture was unsuccessful until 1962, when the subterranean drainage system became more efficient. In June 1965 a cornfield on the plain extended over an area of 2 hectares (about 5 acres) (fig. 2, bottom).
The Llano de Curupichu lies along the barranca at the eastern edge of the lava field. (fig. 1) . Floods that supplied most of i~s sediment were finally stopped in 1953 by a manmade bypass (Segerstrom 1960, p. 10). Since then, Curupichu has been successfully cultivated.
There are two Llanos de Tipicua, on and near the northeast edge of the lava field. One of them, inside the lava fie] d, was filled as a result of manmade eliversion of sediment-laden floods that bypassed Curupichu. Its fill covers a lava surface of 9 hectares (about 22 acres) with an average thickness of about 3 m. The other llano lies nearby but outside the lava field. Enriched by an admixture of eroded preexisting soil, largely brought in by ash-laden floods, these two areas have been cultivated since 1959 and 1953, respectively, mostly in corn but also in beans, squash, and chilicayote. Up to 1965, the ·western llano had been invaded by water on an average of about 30 times each summer, but only 5 or 6 times by sizable flash floods. In 1965 and for several years previously, the water quickly drained away into surrounding rock of the 1944 lava flow without drowning much of the crop. Before that, an efficient drainage system had not been developed on the western llano, and most of the plants were killed by flooding. On the eastern llano, equilib-
rium between runoff and infiltration of water into the
lava field was established much earlier, and cultiva-
tion there was profitable as early as 1957. The Llano de Ch6rotiro, just north of the Llanos
de Tipacua, is floored with sediment washed in chiefly
from the Arroyo de Nureto, to the northeast, and dammed by the lava field. In 1965 a small depression,
about 1 m in diameter and 1 m deep, provided underground drainage of excess floodwater into lava near

The relatively mall Llano de Terupicua, which was produced by lava damming of an arroyo from the north, has an area of about 3 hectares (about 7112 acres) . A 6-cen timeter increase in the depth of fill at the edge of the lava field was observed over the period 1957-60 (Segerstrom, 1961, p. D225), and a gully that formerly directed floodwater into the lava had been filled. A comparable increase seems to have taken place over the period 1960-65. Corn was first planted at Terupicua in 1959 and has done well ever Since.
The large Llano Grande, farther to the west, was formed chiefly by floo ling from the Arroyo de Hurengo, where it was blocked by the 1944 lava flow. Ar some time durjng the period 1947-57 the basin overflowed westward toward Huirambosta (Segerstrom, 1960, p. 11). In January and February 1965, a rock dam 11f2 n1 high and 80 m long \Vas built at the place of overflow, and by June of that year the dam had caused considerable sedimentation upstream (fig. 4). Cultivation of older parts of the Llano Grande basin fill began in 1953 and progressed slowly for 7 or 8 years. In June 1965, the cultivated area was about 10 times greater than in 1960.

the Rio Itzicuaro (west of area shown on fig. 1), several kilometers downstream from Huirambosta, are probably fed by ground water from the lava field of Paricutin. The flow of these springs increased more than 50 percent during the period 1946-57. This change was attributed to increase of effectiveness of the lava field as a recharge area (Segerstrom, 1960, p. 15). Surprisingly enough, by 1965 there had been a marked decline of average flow of these springs, although this decline seems not to have been accompanied by a marked lessening of mean annual rainfall.
In summary, the ponded areas dramatically illustrate recovery of the zone devastated by the volcano. Slopes along preexisting valleys, unsuited for agriculture because of topographic relief, have been buried. In their stead, the overlying new fields, flat as a floor and enriched by flood sediment, have already become productive.
ASH-COVERED TERRAIN AWAY FROM THE LAVA FIELD
Much of the region around Paricutin is densely wooded, largely with pines. One of the first effects of the eruption, especially to the west of Paricutin, was the killing of the forest. In 1944 the thickly ash-covered area of Cerro de Canicjuata, Lorna Larga, and Cerro de Corucjuata bristled with dead trees. The ash-covered floor of the dead forest was intricately dissected with rills and gullies, even on interfluves (fig. 5 top) . Many of these rills and gullies were initiated by rainwater running down the tree trunks. Two decades later, the landscape just west of the lava field had a very different aspect; almost all the old tree trunks had fallen and had reached an advanced state of decay. Windborne seeds had taken root, preferentially in the old forest litter (fig. 5, bottom) (compare with Eggler, 1959, fig. 3), and together with other seedlings that had sprouted in preexisting soil exposed on the floors of deep gullies they gave rise to a vigorous stand of high grasses and shrubs. Most of the high grasses are in the genus Eupatorium (at least 6 species). The shrubs include BMcharis (2 species) , and Senecio (3 species) . Some specimens of E•upatorium that were growing in ash had attained heights as great as 4 m in 1965. Also becoming increasingly important was the genus Buddle.ia, with two species present as shrubs or small trees. These two species were first observed by W. A. Eggler, who visited the area in 1963 (written commun., Oct. 1965). A factor that favorably influences growth in these areas js animal droppings, because these further fertilize the ash.
Most of the forest north and east of the lava field was not killed by the ashfall. New trees are growing

which once formed clearings in the forest. The fields were generally in the flattest areas, where there has been little or no rill erosion since the ashfall. The factors that encouraged revegetation in the dead forest (presence of decaying tree trunks and admixture of eroded and redeposited soil) were thus absent in the fields, and significant numbers of new plants were growing only around the scattered trees that dotted these open spaces (Segerstrom, 1960, p. 16-17; Eggler, 1963, p. 50-52) or near the edges of the bordering forest. By 1965, much of the vicinity of Zirosto, about 8 km west-northwest of Paricutin (Segerstrom, 1961, fig. 370.2), as well as the areas of Huirambosta, 5 km north-northwest of the cone, Nureto, 61/2 km northeast of the cone, and San Salvador Teruto, 4 km south-southeast of the cone (fig. 1), were still virtually barren.
Redeposition of ash by the wind has had two principal effects. Fields in the Zirosto area and toward the east, where some grass continued to grow during and since volcanic activity, had a hurrunocky surface in 1965. The hummocks, which are composed of thickly matted, creeping Bermuda grass, Oynodon (Eggler, 1963, p. 52), and wind-driven ash, did not exist i.n the region immediately before the eruption. By June 1965, however, they had grown to mounds as much as 7-8 m long and 1112 m high (fig. 6) (compare with Eggler, 1963, fig. 8). Another effect of eolian actionthis one in the ash-killed forest-has been the filling in of rill heads with loose ash during successive dry seasons (NoYember to May) .
The following cycle of development has resulted from water erosion of the ash-killed forest terrain: (1) Incision of rills and gullies. (2) Their lateral
(and in part longitudinal) growth, partly through

in two environments: under older trees, and on exposed patches of the original soil. The many surviving trees shed guinumo (pine needles and similar litter) on the ash and provided fertile ground for seedlings, as was noted in 1957 and 1959 (Segerstrom, 1960, p. 16; Eggler, 1963, p. 48). By 1965 some of the seedlings in ash had grown to trees 2-3 m tall. The underlying soil was exposed over broad areas where 'the ashfall had been less than 25 em and where the slope is more than 15° or 20°, and it was also exposed in relatively narrow, steeply sloping areas where the ash cover was thicker. These stripped areas provided optimum conditions for revegetation, and they are now well covered by plants except on nearly vertical walls of some gullies, and even there mosses coat much of the surface.
There has been much less revegetation of open fields

capture of tributary and neighboring channels. In

;.. 1946, single storms produced capture of Arroyo de Canicjuata drainage by tributaries of the deeper Arro-

yo de Corucjuata (Segerstrom, 1950, p. 90.) Surveys

along the narrow divide between the two arroyos have

indicated, however, that no such drainage changes

took place between 1957 and 1965. (3) The overall

"softening" of the landscape as the gully divides

become rounded. This sequence is illustrated by pho-

tographs taken in 1946, 1957, and 1965 of a knoll north

of Lorna Larga (fig. 7).

Runoff and rill erosion on the formerly wooded

ridges and slopes are now inhibited by the dead tree

trunks which have fallen (fig. 5, bottom) and by the

new shrubs and trees which are springing up. This

is exemplified by an area on the lower slopes of the

Arroyo de Canicjuata where kill by the eruption was

nearly 100 percent and gullying was intense (fig. 8).

The recovery here occurred without marked addition-

al stripping of the ash mantle, in 8 years.

On a few very steep ridges and slopes, however,

continuance of the stripping of ash and soil during the

period 1957-65 was evident. Headwalls of major gul-

lies on old cones of the area, and the fronts of old

lava flows where ash from Paricutin was deposited on

slopes steeper than about 30° to 35 °, were still being

eroded. Continued stripping of areas that already had

been partly freed of the ash by 1957 was particularly

evident, in 1965, in a dozen or so headwalls on the

Canicjuata and Corucjuata cones and at the lower

edges of the Cocjarao and Nurendiro lava mesas (fig.

1). Nevertheless, the newly exposed original soil al-

ready supported heavy vegetation in such places, and

so little ash remained in 1965 that there is little im-

lnediate likelihood of much further erosion.

Where the forest was not killed by the eruption,

stabilization of the ash mantle has been even more

rapid. In 1957 it was noted that the floor of a crater

of the Curitzeran cinder cones, 2112 northwest of Llano

Grande, had not been raised by redeposition of ash

washed down from the inner slopes since 1946, indi-

cating that erosion was unimportant. At that place,

where 34 em of ash had been deposited by direct fall,

"forest growth had inhibited, if not stopped ero-

sion and redeposition" (Segerstrom, 1960, p. 13-14).

By 1965 there had still been no measurable increase

of the crater deposit at Curitzeran. There, and in

other areas of surviving forest where stripping of

slopes had not been completed by 1946, the ash mantle

from Paricutin is probably firmly established as part FIGURE 7.-Knoll north of Lorna Larga, showing changes in

ORGANIC GEOCHEMISTRY OF THREE NORTH PACIFIC DEEP-SEA SEDIMENT SAMPLES
By JAMES G. PALACAS, VERNON E. SWANSON; and GEORGE W. MOORE, Denver, Colo.; Menlo Park, Calif.
Work done 'in cooperation with the U.S. Coast and Geodetic Survey

A.bstract.-Analyses of two samples, one taken about 150 miles northwest of Hawaii, and the other about halfway between the Aleutian Islands and the Hawaiian Islands, showed a nearly identical organic and inorganic composition, indicating a similar environment of deposition and history of diagenesis. The third sample, taken from the Aleutian Trench, south of the Aleutian Islands, showed significant differences and was characterized by the largest amount of organic carbon (0.34 percent), humic acids (1,145 ppm), and amino acids (180 ppm).
As part of a broader program to study organic matter in modern environments o"f deposition, three deep-sea core samples from the North Pacific were obtained for studies. Analyses were made for organic carbon, carbonate carbon, amino acids, humic acids, and bitumens. Emission spectrographic, X-ray, and microscopic analyses were also conducted, and moisture content determined.
Small segments about 15 centimeters in length were taken from 3 of some 15 cores collected during the 1963 cruise of the U.S. Coast and Geodetic Survey ship Pioneer. These cores were collected by personnel of the U.S. Coast and Geodetic Survey and turned over to the U.S. Geological Survey for geological and geochemical studies. The core sections were taken about 40 em from the top of the 3 cores, which range from 1.2-2.5 meters in length and are 10 em in diam-eter. To prevent bacterial decay, the cores were frozen immediately after they were collected, and the cores and samples from them were kept frozen until they were analyzed.
The nautical positions where the cores were taken are shown on figure 1. Measurements of temperature, salinity, and oxygen content of the ocean water above two of the sediment samples are given in table 1.

PROCEDURE
The frozen core sections were removed from their plastic liners and all possible precautions to eliminate contamination were taken. Small representative fractions were examined for grain size, texture, mineralogy, fossil content, and color. No significant lithologic differences, from top to bottom, were noted within any of the core sections, and each section was designated as one sample.
Moisture content was determined by drying small portions of the samples for 48 hours at 100°C. The bulk of the core material was dried in a nitrogen atmosphere_ under vacuum at 40°C, and the dried sediment was ground in a porcelain mortar to less than 115 mesh. The powdered samples were stored in a freezer at -20°C until analyzed.
Carbon analyses were made following the procedures described by Rader and Grimaldi (1961, p. 3339). Total carbon was determined in an inductionfurnace carbon analyzer by burning a sample at 1350°C and converting the volume of evolved carbon dioxide to percentage of carbon by weight. Carbonate carbon was determined by a gasometric method. Organic carbon was calculated as the difference between total carbon and carbonate carbon.
The organic matter soluble in benzene, herein referred to as the bitumen fraction, was obtained by extracting 50 grams of sample with 150· milliliters of benzene for 5-10 minutes in an ultrasonic agitator at room temperature. After three successive ultrasonic treatments, the mixtures were centrifuged. The supernatant solutions were decanted and combined, evaporated to dryness, and weighed. A control (with no sample added) was also run simultaneously with the

three core samples, and no appreciable contamination was detected. No attempt was made to remove any free sulfur that might have been present, nor to fractionate the bitumen extract into its respective saturated hydrooarbon, aromatic hydrocarbon, and asphaltic fractions.
The alkaline-soluble humic fraction was obtained by suspending the bitumen-free sediment from the above treatment in 150 ml of 0.1N NaOH and shaking vigorously on a mechanical shaker for 8-10 hours at room temperature. The brown-colored extract was separated from the sediment by centrifugation and filtration. Additional extractions of the humic fraction were run at ultrasonic frequencies for 5~10-minute intervals with occasional shaking until color was no longer detected in the solvent. After the additional

extracts were centrifuged and filtered, they were combined with the first extract and then acidified with HCl to pH 1. The resulting flocculate, which contains the humic acid, was separated by centrifugation from the supernatant or fulvic-acid fraction, washed with 0.001N HCl, and dried to constant weight. Due to
varying amounts of inorganic matter, particularly silica, in the humic-acid flocculate, carbon and ash analyses were run on the dried extract. The actual humic-acid fraction was then calculated to an ashfree basis and is reported as such in table 2.
The amino acids were released by refluxing 20 g of sediment with 60 ml of 6N HCl for 24 hours. After treatment with strongly acidic ion-exchange resins to remove inorganic salts, the amino-acid extract was fractionated into individual amino acids by two-qimen-

sional, ascending paper chromatography (Block and others, 1958, p. 35, 118-). Identification was accomplished by reacting the amino acids with a 0.25-percent solution of ninhydrin in acetone to which 1 percent lutidene was added. Semiquantitative estimates of the content of each amino acid were 1nade by visually comparing the intensity and size of the unknown amino-acid spots to known standard amino-acid spots. The accuracy of this method is estimated to be about. + 15 percent.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

to be almost identical in mineral composition, whereas core P126 differs in having less mica and quartz and more montmorillonite and plagioclase.
Emission spectrographic analysis of the samples showed little difference in the value of most elements (table 3). Sample P126, however, does contain considerably more Ca than either P105 or P116, and P105 shows significantly higher values for Mn, Ba, La, and Ni than does P126. The concentration of the elements of each core sample compares closely with the average value for deep-sea clay as compiled by Turekian and W edepohl (1961, table 1).

The samples for this study were deliberately taken at a uniforin depth below the sea floor. However, additional studies, to be reported elsewhere, indicate that the geologic age of the samples is not uniform. The sample from core P126 is probably Pleistocene, and those from P105 and P116, pre-Pleistocene.
Sediment analyses
Microscopic examination showed that samples P105 and P116 are generally similar in grain size, mineral composition, and color (table 2). Sample P116, however, contains a richer assemblage of radiolaria and diatoms. The Aleutian Trench sample (P126) differs from the pale-yellowish-brown clay sediment of P105 and P116 in its higher silt content and in its lightgray to greenish-gray color.
X-ray analyses of three samples, made by L. G. Schultz, of the U.S. Geological Survey, show that the major mineralogic components are potassium mica and chlorite, with lesser amounts of montmorillonite, quartz, and plagioclase. Cores P105 and P116 appear

Organic carbon content
The data show a nearly similar composition for the various fractions of organic matter in samples P105 and P116, which were collected, respectively, at a statio9- about 150 miles northwest of Hawaii, and at a station near the middle of the North Pacific. The calculated organic matter content in both these samples (0.24 and 0.25 percent) is comparable to the average organic content of 0.27 percent in tropical siliceous ·diatomaceous mud of the Western Pacific Ocean as reported by Romankevich (1961). In contrast, the Aleutian Trench sample (P126) contains more than twice as much organic matter (0.58 percent) as either P105 or P116; yet even this amount is relatively low compared to son1e other North Pacific deep-.sea sediment. Romankevich (1961, p. 384) found the greatest amount of organic matter in the highlatitude diatomaceous mud of the vVestern· Pacific Ocean, which averages 0.85 percent organic carbon; and Bordovskii (1957, p. 2) found the following high contents of organic carbon in Recent sediments of the

however, also reported high humic-acid contents ranging from 30 to 60 percent of the total organic matter in offshore sediment of California, and Romankevich (l957, p. 4) showed a range of 27-47 percent in the bottom sediment east of the I\:amchatka Peninsula in the northwestern part of the Pacific Ocean. The humic-acid content of P116, however, is only 4 percent of the total organic matter, and in P105 humic acids make \IP less than 1 percent. The very low value in P105 resembles the values (less than 2 percent) reported for the red abyssal clays of the Western Pacific

Ocean (Romankevich, 1961).
Bitumens
The bitumen content of the three core samples ranges from 40 to 70 ppm (table ~) and accounts for 0.7-2.8 percent of the total organic matter (table 4).

Bering Sea: 1.46 percent in silty clays, 1.08 percent in fine silts, and 0.92 percent in clay sediments.

The amount of bitumen in these samples compares closely with the amount of bitumen in other similar deep-sea sediment of the North P.acific Ocean. For

Humic acids
The humic-acid content ranges from 20 to 100 ppm of dry sediment in samples P105 and P116, respectively, to as much as 1,145 ppn1 in sample P126. The humic-acid content of these three samples, pn.rticularly P105 and P116, is relatively low when compared to some of the values obtained for other deep-sea sediment of the North Pacific. For example, the average values of the alkali ne-so]uble humic matter in the finegrained sediments of the Bering Sea were reported as 4,800 ppm for c]ays, 5,100 ppm for fine silts, and 7,800 ppm for silty clays (Bordovskii, 1957).
In these three deep sea samples, the humic acids

example, Romankevich (1957, p. 2) reported, in another core s.ample, bitumen content (extracted with benzene and alcohol) of 1.00 ppm for diatomaceous clay at a core depth of 10-32 em and 40 ppm for clay at a depth of 245-253 ern.
The bitume1~ values of these North Pacific deep-sea sediments, however, seem relatively very low when compared to the bitumen values of other marine sediments. In some of the basins off the California coast, such as the Santa Barbara' Basin, Catalina Basin, and Santa Cruz Basin, the sediment obtained .fron1 cores at depths of 0.5-5 m below the sediment surface yielded ·a much higher content of bitumen--an average of 1,930, 925, and 1,500 ppm, respectively (Orr and

Jr' account for nearly the entire humic fraction extrac- Emery, 1956, p. 1251); and the surface sediment of

table with 0.1N NaOH, with the possible exception of . these same 3 cores contained higher amounts, namely

P126, in which a small amount of fulvic acid was ob- 3,010, 1,410, and 1,840 ppm respectively. Although the

C106

MAIRrNFJ GEOIJOGY

bitumen values of these offshore basin sediments are relatively high, their ratios of extractable bitumens to total organic matter (range of 1.55-4.75 percent) are nearly similar to the ratios obtained for the North Pacific sediment samples. It should be pointed out that Orr and Emery, in their extraction procedure, used a solvent system of 70 percent benzene, 15 percent methanol, and 15 percent acetone; a mixed solvent generally extracts a larger fraction of organic matter, especially the more polar organic compounds, than benzene alone.
Amino acids
The amino-acid content, including both combined and free amino acids, ranges from 50 to 180 ppm. Despite the range in amino-acid content the ratio of e~tractable amino acid to total organic matter is quite similar in all three, ranging from 2 to 3.1 percent and averaging about 2.7 percent (table 4). It is interesting to note that the amino-acid fraction of P105 exceeds both the humic-acid and bitumen fractions (table 4) and that the amino-acid content in all three samples is generally similar to the bitumen content.
A rather high content of an unknown amino-acidlike compound was noted in all three samples (table 5). This unknown compound, which may be an artificial substance produced during the treatment with strong acid, has a distinctive color similar to that of aspartic acid when reacted with ninhydrin and lutidine on a paper chromatogram.
In all three samples the combined content of the basic amino acids, arginine and lysine, is greater than the content of the acidic amino acids, aspartic and glutamic acid. Similar relations of basic amino acids predominating over acidic amino acids in marine sediments, particularly those sediments buried below the sediment surface to a depth of 0.5 m or more, were also indicated in the sediment studies of the Santa Barbara Basin (Degens and others, 1_961, p. 418), in the experimental Mohole off Guadalupe Island, Mexico

(Rittenberg and others, 1963, p. 162), and in the San Diego Basin (Degens and others, 1964, p. 62).
Alanine appeared to be the most abundant of the neutral amino acids. The aromatic acids, tyrosine and phenylalanine, were not detected except for a very small amount, 3 ppm, of phenylalanine in sample P126. Tryptophane may have been present but was not looked for because it would have been destroyed during acid hydrolysis.
CONCLUSIONS
Samples from cores P105 and P116 are more similar to each other in organic and mineral composition, content if microfossils, environment of deposition, and history of diagenesis than to the sample from core P126 (the Aleutian Trench sample).
Although the humic acids, bitumens, and amino acids were selected to characterize the kind of organic matter present in the core samples, the combined total of the 3 fractions constitutes less than 10 percent of the total organic matter in samples P105 and P116. In P126, however, these 3 fractions make up about 24 percent of the total organic matter, of which 20 percent is represented by the humic-acid fraction. The remainder of the organic matter in all three samples is believed to be made largely of complex organic matter that has high molecular weight, is in part polymerized, and is not extracted by organic solvents or dilute acids and bases.
The large alkaline-soluble humic fraction of sample P126 and the proximity to land indicate that much of the organic matter was probably derived from the nearby Aleutian Islands and other parts of southern Alaska. Support for this conclusion is that lignin, a constituent of woody plants, is considered by many scientists as one of the major sources of this humic fraction, and that woody plant fragments have been observed in other core samples from near the Aleutian Trench (Smith, 1963, p. C77).

HEAVY MINERALS IN STREAM SEDIMENTS OF THE CONNORS PASS QUADRANGLE, WHITE PINE COUNTY, NEVADA
By E. J. YOUNG, Denver, Colo.

Abstract.-A comparative study of the heavy minerals in the sands being transported from Paleozoic sedimentary and Tertiary volcanic source rocks in the Connors Pass quadrangle in the central part of the Schell Creek Range shows that (1) the abundance of heavy minerals varies directly as their sorting, and (2) the abundance of the opaque minerals varies directly as the median size of the heavy minerals. The first empirical result confirms the theoretical relationship described by Rubey in 1933. Zircon/sphene ratios in 230-325-mesh stream sands derived from limestone are generally 1 or less; those from clastic-rock areas are greater. Higher content of allanite and sphene is found where source rocks are volcanic; higher content of zircon, rutile, and tourmaline where they are clastic.
The purpose of this study is to relate heavy-min.eral suites in stream sediments to source areas drained by the major creeks in the Connors Pass quadrangle, Schell Creek Range, White Pine County, Nev. Drainage areas, generalized lithology, and sample sites for the seven creeks studied are shown in figure 1. Drainage areas rise to a maximum elevation of about 10,400 feet, and sample sites range in elevation from 6,200 to 7,300 feet. From north to south the four creeks that drain eastward are Cleve Creek, Bastian Creek, Cooper Creek, and an unnamed stream 1 mile south of Majors Place, which is at the junction of U.S. Highways 6, 50, and 93. The sampled streams draining westward are Taylor Creek in the south and Steptoe Creek and its tributary, Cave Creek, in the north.
Acknowledgm.ent.-Appreciation is expressed to Harald Drewes, of the U.S. Geological Survey, for lithologic information.
METHODS
At each sample site about a pound of sediment was taken from just below the surface of the streambed or adjacent bank in order to sample the youngest material unaffected by winnowing action of the wind. Car-

bonaceous matter was removed using a 10-percent solution of H 20z, and limestone fragments were dissolved with cold 1 :4 HCl. After elutriation to remove clay and the finest silt, the samples were dried and screened at 35 mesh (0.50 mm). The undersize material was separated with bromoform, weighed, and sieved for 20 minutes on a shaking machine to obtain eight size grades. Magnetite was removed from each of these with a hand magnet.
The recommendations of Rubey (1933) were followed in selecting the 2 size grades to be used for study, 230-325 mesh (0.062-0.044 mm) size grade and the size grade containing the median of the heavy minerals. These two size grades for each sample w~re run through a microsplitter and then 1nounted in Aroclor (n = 1.66) , after which at least 325 grains were counted in each mount. Size grades containing the median for each sample are:

SIZ·E DISTRIBUTION

Size distribution of all the heavy minerals is shown in the histograms of figure 1. The heavy-mineral fraction of finest grain size (sample 2, Basti3Jn Creek) contains the least amount of opaque minerals, while the coarsest fraction (sample 5, Taylor Creek) contains the greatest amount of opaque minerals. For the seven samples studied the amount of opaque minerals increases directly with the median grain size of the. heavy-mineral fraction (fig. 2). The Bastian Creek sample also is strongly (negatively) skewed towards the coarse fraction and is thus distinguished

from the Steptoe Creek sample, with zero skewness, and from the other five samples, which are positively skewed. Finally, the best sorted sands contain the greatest amount of heavy minerals (fig. 3) in accordance with Rubey's (1933) theoretical results.
MINERALOGY
The mineral content of the average of the two size grades of each sample is shown on figure 1. Thus, for example, in sample 1 the number frequency (expressed as percent) of mica in the 230-325-mesh size grade was 6.0; in the 80-120-mesh size grade, 3.3. Hence the average is 4.7, which has been plotted on the pie diagram of figure 1.
Of the opaque minerals found, the black ores are mostly hematite with minor amounts of ilmenite and unidentified minerals. The red opaque minerals are earthy hematite. X-ray powder patterns of yelloworange opaque minerals show peaks of geothite, muscovite (sericite), and rutile (leucoxene). vVhite opaque minerals were found by X-ray study to be mixtures of muscovite (sericite) and rutile (leucoxene).
Rock-forming minerals in the sand include hypersthene, monoclinic pyroxene, and several different types of amphibole. The most com1non type of amphibole is pleochroic from olive drab to green or brown and has refractive indices slightly greater than 1.66. ~1uscovite is abundant only in sample 2. Chlorite is scarce in all samples. Brown biotite is conunon. A less com1non red-brown biotite was tentatively identified as lepidomelane (iron-titanium biotite) in samples 4 and 6. This identification is based on the following optical properties noted: 2 V ~32° (-) ; strong dispersion,
T<v; ,8>1.66; and yellow-brown to red-brown pleo-
chroic colors on the basal plates. Of the nonopaque accessory minerals, zircon is nlost-
ly colorless to pale pink, but a yellow variety was found in sample 2. Sphene occurs as mostly colorless anhedral grains; infrequently the grains are pale yellow and slightly pleochroic. Six varieties of tourmaline with slight differences in color were noted. The most common variety is pleochroic from colorless to shades of brown. Allanite is present as prismatic crystals; some grains are metamict and isotropic. It is possible that undetected chevkinite is present; it is sometimes difficult to distinguish between allanite and chevkinite on the basis of optical properties alone. Garnet, epidote, and yellow to yellowbrown rutile are persistent but scarce. Apatite is found in two san1ples, and only in small amounts, but it is probable that this mineral has been removed fron1 the samples by the acid leaching. Sillimanite was found only in sample 2.

PROVENANCE
The drainage area of Cleve Creek is underlain mostly by Cambrian quartzite and by Cambrian and Ordovician limestone and shale. The heavy minerals are dominantly opaque. The zircon/sphene ratio in the 230-325- mesh material is 2.35. Subsequent ratios are also given for this size fraction.
The small drainage area of Bastian Creek is underlain almost entirely by Cambrian and Ordovician limestone and shale. As noted earlier, this is the only stream where size distributions of the heavy minerals were found to show a negative skewness. The zircon/ sphene ratio is 0.78. Sillimanite indicates metamorphism of some of the source rocks.
Cooper Creek drains Cambrian and Ordovician limestone, Mississippian shale, Pennsylvanian and Permian calcareous clastic rocks, and Tertiary latite and dacite. The rather large amount of opaque minerals in the heavy-mineral fraction probably came from the Mississippian Chainman Shale. Allanite is contributed by the Tertiary volcanic rocks, and the rather high zircon/sphene ratio of 2.67 is attributed to the clastic Permian Arcturus and Rib Hill Formations.
The drainage area of the unnamed creek south of ~1ajors Place is underlain mostly by Permian calcareous clastic rocks and by Pennsylvanian and Permian limestone. The clastic rocks are probably the source of the large amounts of zircon, tourmaline, and rutile found in the sediments of this stream and result in the high, 14.50, zircon/sphene ratio. The strongest bimodal (poorest sorting) size distribution of heavy minerals occurs here, the coarse mode stemming from the opaque minerals and the fine mode from the unusually large amount of accessory minerals.
Taylor Creek drains mostly Mississippian shale, smaller areas of Permian clastic rocks, and Mississippian, Pennsylvanian, and Permian limestone. The large amount of opaque minerals in sediments of the creek are obviously derived from the Mississippian Chainman Shale, as the source rocks are almost entirely of that formation. The high zircon/sphene ratio, 7.33, is due to the clastic rocks. Strong positive skewness results from the large amounts of opaque minerals which tend to be coarse.
Source rocks in the Cave Creek drainage area are mostly Devonian limestone and dolomite and Tertiary conglomerate and quartz latite. There are smaller areas of lower to middle Paleozoic limestone, dolomite, and shale. Sphene and allanite are derived from the volcanic rocks, and the zircon/sphene ratio of 1.00 approaches that of a pure limestone terrane, owing to the absence of sand-size clastic source material in the drainage area.

Steptoe and Cave Creeks drain mostly Cambrian and Ordovician limestone, Mississippian shale, and Pennsylvanian and Permian limestone. There are also smaller areas of lower to middle Paleozoic limestone, dolomite, and shale, and Tertiary volcanic rocks and conglomerate. Opaque minerals come from the shale, and amphibole and allanite from the volcanic rocks; the low zircon/sphene ratio, 0.50, results from the lack of sand-size clastic source material in the drainage area.

CONCLUSIONS
Large amounts of allanite and sphene, which together contribute about 50 percent of the nonopaque

accessory minerals, are characteristic of volcanic terrane in this area. In sediments of Steptoe Creek the relatively high (1 percent) garnet content, along with large amounts of allanite and sphene, suggests that . garnet, too, is derived from volcanic rocks.
Zircon/sphene ratios of 1.00 or less seem to result from limestone terranes and lack of clastic source rocks. Ratios greater than 1.00 indicate the presence of clastic source rocks. The reason for low zircon/

sphene ratios in limestone is not known. It may either result from authigenic sphene in the limestone, or it may result from an originally greater amount of sphene than zircon being deposited during formation of the limestone.

GENERAL FEATURES OF THE BOUGUER GRAVITY FIELD IN SOUTHWESTERN OREGON
By H. RICHARD BLANK, JR., Menlo Park, Calif.

A.bstract.-A contoured Bouguer anomaly map of a region 75 miles wide and 130 miles long shows an average west-toenst negative gradient that corresponds qualitatively to an inlund thickeuing of the continental crust. Gravity highs in the Const Range may reflect ultramafic bodies at depth as well as nea r-surfnce accumulations of lower Eocene basalt. Anomalous northeast trends in the Cascade Range are attributed to n. coucealed extensi01i of the Klamath Mountains upwarp. A uegative nnomnly not exceeding 10 mgals is associated with the Crater Lake caldera, and a negative anomaly of 20 to 30 mgals coincides with the northern end of the Klamath graben.
In the summers of 1962 and 1963 a reconnaissance gravity survey was n1ade of a rectangular region some 75 miles wide and 130 1niles long, or about 10,000 square miles in area, that extends across southwestern Oregon from the upper IGama:th basin to the Pacific Ocean (fig. 1). The region embraces portions of the Great Basin, Middle Cascade Mountains, IGamath Mountains, and Oregon Coast Range physiographic sections of Fenneman (1931). The gravity survey has the dual purpose of supplementing recent geologic mapping in the region and investigating major crustal elmnents in a zone transitional from a continental interior to an oceanic environment.

GRAVITY DATA

A base net was established with reference to the Eugene and Medford airport gravity stations of Woollard (1958) . A value of 980,236.5 milligals was assumed for the observed gravity at Medford, based on a closed-loop tie to U.S. Geological Survey base station "A" at Menlo Park, Calif. This value is 1.0 mgal lower than "\Voollard's most recently published value for 1\iedford (Woollard and Rose, 1963) but results in a value identical to his for the observed gravity at Eugene. The location of primary and secondary base stations and nearly all points of observation (a total of about 2,250 stations) is shown in figure 2 (see also Blank, 1965). Two gravimeters were used in the

Rock units shown on the geologic map are grouped for convenience into three main divisions, on the basis of age and physiographic location-the l{]amath Mountains and Coast Range pre-Tertiary sequence, the Coast Range sequence of Cretaceous and early Tertiary age, and the Cascades and Great Basin sequence of Tertiary and Quaternary age.
A structural synthesis for the ultramafic belts of northwestern California and southwestern Oregon, which include the IGamath Mountains region, has recently been publi.shed by Irwin (1964). Rocks involved in the Late Jurassic Nevadan orogeny in the region are distinguished from all younger rocks in Irwin's analysis by the terms "subjacent" and "superJ.acent." I n figure 3, pre-Nevadan rocks, Nevadan intrusive rocks, and some of the ultramafic bodies constitute "subjacent" terrane of Irwin. The pre-Nevadan rocks are a eugeosynclinal suite of weakly to strongly metamorphosed sedimentary and volcanic rocks that occur in the eastern part of the northern IGamath Mountains and also near the Pacific Ocean. Their age is c?iefly Triassic and Late Jurassic; locally some Paleozoic rocks may be present. The associated Nevadan plutons range from felsic to mafic.
Eugeosynclinal rocks assigned to the Dothan Formation (Diller, 1907) consist of sandstone, mudstone, shale, and conglomerate, with interbedded lava and chert (Wells and Walker, 1953). They form a broad northeast-trending belt on the northwest flank of the known pre-Nevadan portion of the Klamath Mountains. The age and stratigraphic position of the Dothan are controversial, owing both to a lack of fossils and to the steep and faulted marginal contacts.

enies. The "subjacent" pre-Nevadan rocks and Nevadan intrusives west of the Dothan belt are possibly upper plate rocks of a Late Cretaceous thrust whose root. zone lies east of the belt of Dothan. This concept is adopted in section 0-0' of figure 3 for purposes of illustration.
The area surveyed includes the southern end of the so-called Coast Range early Tertiary eugeosyncline that is inferred to have occupied a generally linear region extending from Vancouver Island, British Columbia, to the IGamath Mountains (Snavely and Wagner, 1963; 1964). Although the lateral extent of this feature is poorly known, the eastern margin probably lay within the site of the present Cascade Range, and a western margin may have existed a considerable distance west of the present Pacific coastline. To a first approximation the eugeosyncline is considered to include the terrane of the Coast Range sequence in the present report (see figs. 1 and 3).
Four rock units are distinguished in the Coast Range sequence : (1) Upper Cretaceous and lower and middle Eocene sedimentary rocks (chiefly alternating mudstone and sandstone of the Umpqua and Tyee Formations), (2) lower to middle Eocene volcanic rocks (basaltic flows and pillow lavas intercalated with sedimentary rocks of the Umpqua Formation and equivalent to the Siletz River Volcanic Series in the central part of the Oregon Coast Range), (3) upper Eocene volcanic rocks (chiefly andesitic pyroclastic rocks of the Colestin and Calapooya Formations), and (4) upper Eocene and younger sedimentary rocks (sandstone, siltstone, and shale, with subordinate coal). The upper Eocene volcanic rocks are exposed only

ward into the Great Basin and there interfinger with ·volcanic-type sedimentary rocks and pyroclastic rocks.
QUALITATIVE INTERPRETATIONS
Total gravity .relief shown by the map is about 210 mgals. There is an overall decrease in average Bougt~er valu~s from west to east of about 1 mgal per mile. Tlus corresponds qualitatively to an increase in average regional elevation progressing inland from the continental margin, which is compatible with an isostatic condition of the Airy type and an inland thickening of the continental crust. Various isostatic models for the region are currently being tested.
The highest Bouguer values, as much as +40 mgals, occur on an elongate north-trending gravity high ':hose axis passes just east of Coos Bay on the west side of the map area (fig. 3). Lower Eocene olivine basalts are exposed at several places near the crest of this anomaly where they have been tectonically elevated. The local structures are roughly en echelon and trend north-northeasterly, but the overall patte~ns. of basalt outcr~p and linear gravity feature cOinCide. Other gravity highs are associated with lower to middle Eocene basalt cropping out at, and north of, Roseburg.
It m~ght be assu~ed that these positive gravit;y anomahes are expressiOns of thick partially concealed accumulations of dense submarine lavas in accordance with interpretations of gravity su;veys of the Coast Range in northwestern Oregon (Bromery and Snavely, 1964) and western Washington (Stuart, 1961). The high near Coos Bay, however, extends southward 10-15 miles into pre-Tertiary terrane, and westward as far as the axial portion of the structural embayment at Coos Bay (shown by the pattern of upper Eocene and younger sedimentary rocks on fig. ~), where a gravity minimum might have been predicted. Moreover, inspection of the gradients suggests a depth to the surface of the anomalous mass of several .miles or more. It therefore seems unlikely that this anomaly can be attributed wholly to the basalts of the Coast Range sequence. Instead, the main s~ur?e of the anomaly may be a high-density mass within the pre-Tertiary basement, such as a gabbroic or ultramafic intrusive body. The basalts would be

extruded through a fissure system genetically related to em~lacement of the deeper anomalous mass; geographically, at least, the system could be considered a northern extension of the Powers fault zone. Alinement of Eocene submarine vents along north-trending fissures is common in the central part of the Oregon

Coast Range (Snavely and others, 1965), though the reason for this is unclear.
Similar considerations apply to interpretation of the positive anomaly at Roseburg. In this case the anomalous mass may underlie Dothan as well as younger rocks, and if so, it is difficult to equate with Eocene volcanic rocks. The presence of ultramafic rocks and serpentinites in tectonic zones associated with the basalts both here and near Coos Bay may support the hypothesis of an ultramafic body at depth.
The gravity high indicated by closure of the -10mgal contour about 40 miles southwest of Roseburg is not associated with any known occurrence of Eocene volc~nic rocks and is probably also best explained by density contrasts within the pre-Tertiary basement. An interpretation attributing the anomaly to an ultramafic mass intruded along a Late Cretaceous thrust plane is depicted in section 0-0' of figure 3.
The detailed configuration of the gravity field of the Coast Range is determined by depth of cover of the Eocene volcanic rocks and by variations in their thickness. Local gravity depressions such as those associated with upper Eocene sedimentary rocks 20 to 30 miles northwest of Roseburg may represent local . depositional basins. The linear low with an amplitude of 10 to 20 mgals located west of the Coos Bay structural embayment may reflect a local lower to middle Eocene structure concealed by younger deposits.
The Cascade Range is, in general, a region of a pronounced negative easterly gravity gradient. The gradient decreases from the Western Cascades to the High Cascades, and is weak or absent in the Great ~asin (eas~ and s.outheast of Crater Lake). A portion of this gradient is the overall west-to-east de,. qpease in gravity associated with inland thickening of ~he continental crust, but upon removal of that trend the Cascades will almost certainly have an associated negative residual anomaly. LaFehr (1965) computed the mass deficiency represented by the negative residual anomaly of the Cascade Range in northern California by the use of Gauss' theorem, and showed that the deficiency was approximately equal to the topographic mass excess of the range, thereby implying that the range is in a state of isostatic equilibrium. He further demonstrated that the negative residual anomaly could be accounted for by a near-surface prism of low-density material and that it was not necessary to invoke thickening of the crust beneath the range to achieve isostatic compensation. In the Cascades of southwestern Oregon such a negative density contrast should be readily provided by the thick sequence of pyroclastic rocks and lava flows that make up the Western Cascades and are presumed to underlie the region to the east.

The western margin of the Cascade Range, if one includes the upper Eocene volcanic formations, is remarkably linear and trends slightly west of north, nearly parallel to the trend of the Powers fault zone and its possible northern extension (fig. 3). Locally, this lineament generally coincides with a sharp gravity discontinuity, which suggests that the structural boundary of the province is a concealed fault or fault zone (profile A-A' and B-B', fig. 3). Elsewhere, particularly east of the l\]amath Mountains, the gravity gradient is more nearly continuous, and the structural transition might be interpreted as a monocline or gentle downwarp of the pre-Tertiary surface (profile 0-0').
Gravity contours in the 'Vestern Cascades 20 to 25 miles east-northeast of Roseburg swing to the northeast and diverge to form a pattern that possibly reflects the progressively n1ore deeply buried northwest mJtrg.in of the J(lamath l\1ountains pre-Tertiary prov.mce. 'Veaker northeasterly trends are present elsewhere in the Cascades and provinces to the east. Thus the gravity data appear to support the contention of Peck and others (1964) that the l{Jamath l\1ountains "upwarp" is continuous beneath the cover of Cenozoic volcanic rocks of the Cascades and central Oregon.
Low-amplitude gravity depressions are associated with Crater Lake and other areas of andesitic volcanism in the I-Iigh Cascades. The Crater Lake complex produces an anomaly of as much as about -10 mgals (closure of the -150-mgal contour) ; the anomaly appears to be centered smnewhat to the northeast of the center of the caldera, although no observations were made on the lake floor. Gravity surveys of similar calderas of the J(rakatoa type in Japan (Yokoyama, 1963) have shown negative anomalies of 10 to 46 mgals coincident with the calderas. The rather small amplitude of the anomaly in this case is probably due to a low-density contrast between fragmental rnaterial occupying the caldera and the "basement" of ancestral l\1ount Mazama, and to the small thickness of such fragmental deposits.
The n1ost conspicuous gravity feature in the eastern portion of the map area is a low of 20 to 30 mgals. This low is produced by low-density fill in the northern end of the Inamath graben to the south of Crater Lake (see section 0-0' of fig. 3). Anomalous trends east of the Cascade Range generally follow the basinrange structural grain and indicate local variations in the thickness of unconsolidated material and sedimentary or pyroclastic rocks intercalated with the lavas.

from -160 and· -170 mgal over the Wind River Range and Granite Mountains to -230 and -235 mgal in the basin. Values range from -170 to -190 mgal over the Owl Creek Mountains. From incomplete data, values as high as -180 mgal have been measured over the western edge of the Casper arch, southeast of Powder River. The lowest gravity values occur along the north and northeast sides of the basin in an elongate pattern. This generally coincides with the region containing maximum thicknesses of uppermost Cretaceous and lower Tertiary rocks. The available drill-hole data, however, suggest that the deepest part of the basin, above the top of the Precambrian crystalline basement, lies even closer to the Owl Creek Mountains and the Casper arch than does the trough of the gravity low.
The gravity map of the United States (Woollard, 1964) indicates that the regional gravity field becomes more negative westward and southward across Wyoming. This relation may be the result of increasing crustal thickness, of decreasing density of the crust and upper mantle materials, or of some combination of these two factors, westward and southward across the State. It should be pointed out that because of scarcity of data, gravity contours over the Wind River Range and part of the Wind River Basin were shown by Woollard as trending diagonally across the struc:tural grain of the region. More detailed work, however, now shows that a closed gravity high with Bouguer anomaly values as great as -160 to -170 mgal closely follows the present physiographic and structural outline of the Wind River Range.
Relations between geology and Bouguer anomalies across the Wind River Basin are shown in detail in the two profiles on figure 4. On profile A-A', variations in Bouguer anomaly values are generally consistent with the configuration of the Precambrian surface. The relatively uniform northward dip of the Precambrian surface . on the northeast flank of the Wind River Range is indicated by the uniformly smooth, northeastward-sloping gravity gradient. The small anticline that interrupts the dip slope is indicated by a small positive nose in the gravity contours. The lowest Bouguer anomaly values, reflecting thick
sections of low-density rocks of latest Cretaceous and
early Tertiary age, are located a few miles south of
the structurally deepest part of the basin, but this discrepancy may be attributed in part to the gravitational "masking" etfect of. the large mass of higher density rocks of Precambrian and Paleozoic age at the
surface in the nearby Owl Mountains. Bouguer anomaly values·· increase abruptly at the southern front of
the Owl Creek Mountains, and then flatten markedly

over the crest of the range. However, the values continue to increase northeastward toward Thermopolis even though the .surface of the Precambrian basement complex slopes downward into the Bighorn Basin. This discrepancy between the configuration of the Precambrian surface and the behavior of the gravitational field on the north flank of the Owl Creek Mountains may be caused in part by density variations within the basement complex. Precambrian rocks exposed in Wind River canyon, just south of Thermopolis, for example, include a high proportion of amphibolites and biotite gneisses which are denser than the granitic rocks found in adjacent areas of the range. Variations in crustal thickness or density may also cause the apparent discrepancy (Malahoff, 1964, fig. 8).
Along profile B-B' the Bouguer anomaly values and the configuration of the Precambrian surface correlate less closely than in profile A-A'. Here again, the axis of the gravity low in the basin is displaced south of the structurally deepest part as inferred from well data. Bouguer anomaly values are higher over the Granite Mountains than over the Owl Creek Mountains, possibly indicating that the Precambrian rocks are more dense in the Granite Mountains. South of the Granite Mountains the Bouguer anomaly values decrease to about -235 or -240 mgal in the Great Divide Basin. 'fhe steepest gravity gradient between the central part of the Granite Mountains and the Great Divide Basin is located several miles north of the southern faulted front of the Precambrian core of the mountains, indicating that the Emigrant Trail and related thrust faults clip relatively gently northward beneath the mountains.
The steepened gravity gradient along the southern margin of the Granite Mountains is continuous with the steep gradient along the southeastern end of the Wind River Range (fig. 2). Thus, gravitationally at least, the southern margins of the two uplifts appear to have the same or similar structural relations to the Great Divide Basin.
The relations between small gravity anomalies and the local near-surface structure in the vicinity of Jeffrey City have beeri discussed by D. L. Healey (in Stephens, 1964, p. F70-F78).
Although coverage is incomplete, a local gravity high is apparently present at the southeastern end of the Wind River Range, near the Atlantic City iron mining district. Precambrian rocks in the area include
serpentinite, greenstone, iron-formation, and various amphibole and mica sehists (Bayley, 1963), and these are probably more dense than the granites and granitic
gneisses found elsewhere in the Wind River Range.

J. D. Love (oral commun., 1965), during investigations of the subsurface of a large part of the northern Great Divide Basin, on the other hand, has observed no compelling evidence for a thrust fault that far south in the basin. More data are needed before the true relations can be worked out.
From analysis of the gravity data, it appears that the 1najor flanking faults along the southern margins of the Owl Creek and Granite Mountains are fundamentally different: the fault zone along the Owl Creek Mountains, locally at least, is high angle, whereas that along the Granite Mountains is low angle.

-,, HAWAIIAN SEISMIC EVENTS DURING 1964
By ROBERT Y. KOYANAGI and ARNOLD T. OKAMURA,
Hawaiian Volcano Observatory

Abst?·act.-During 1964, 30,285 earthquakes were detected by seismogrnphs in Hawaii. Of these, 481 of magnitude 2.0 to 5.5 were locnted nnd plotted along the Hawaiian Ridge. One hundred nnd seven earthquakes were reported felt by residents of Hawaii, und 3 were felt us far as Muui and Oahu islands. The Kilauea sununit region and the Kaoild fault region, on the island of Hnwnii, were the m·ens of highest earthquake coucentrution.

1964 SEISMIC CHRONOLOGY
The first and second quarters of 1964 showed a low level of seismic activity. One of the few events of interest was an earthquake of magnitude 3.7 which occurred along the southeast flank of Kilauea at 01h06m 1 on January 7. Residents in the southeastern parts of the island felt the quake strongly. About 44

This report, which summarizes and illustrates the earthquake locations compiled in 1964 in U.S. Geological Survey Hawaiian Volcano Observatory Summaries 33, 34, 35, and 36 (Koyanagi, Okamura, and Powers, 196!5; Okamura and others, 1965; Kinoshita and others, 1965; l(oyanagi and others, 1965), is the third of a series (l(oyanagi, 1964; l(oyanagi and Endo, 1.965) presenting the locations of Hawaiian earthquakes in this form.
Five volcanoes, two of which (1\::ilauea and Mauna Loa) are active, cap the island of Hawaii (fig. 1). Most of the earthquakes noted in this report occurred beneath the island, but a few were beneath other islands on the flawaiian Ridge, and many were beneath the adjacent sea floor. Determinations of earthquake location and magnitude were based on Hawaiian seismic-wave trn.veltimes and procedures compiled and applied by J. P. Eaton since 1956 at the Hawaiian Volcano Observatory. As was noted in the two earlier reports, for 1962 and 1963, earthquakes of magnitude 2.5 or grenter which occur beneath the island of flawaii are located with fair confidence within a 5kilometer sphere of error. Offshore earthquakes may be subject to errors in location of as much as 10 km.
The local enrthquakes plotted (figs. 2, 3, and 4) are those of magnitude 2.0 or greater detected on the HVO seismic net and located al01;g the Hawaiian Ridge, within the geographic coordinates lat 18° to 23° N. and long 154° to 161° W.

FIGURE 5.-Bar graph showing the geographic location and the distribution, with depth, of earthquakes of magnitude 2.0 and greater which occurred in the Hawaiian I slands during 1964.

Earthquake activity along the eastern part of Kilauea's east rift zone increased in late August and September. This area, accessible from the town of Pahoa, was occasionally monitored with a portable seismic unit. A total of 596 local quakes of magnitudes ranging from 0.5 to 3.8 were recorded at HVO's Pahoa seismograph station from August 27 to September 25. In addition, 5 local earthquakes with magnitude~ ranging from 4.4 to 4.9 were strongly felt on the island· during the third quarter. The quake of magnitude 4.9 occurred at OOh25m on September 18, under the southeast flank of Kilauea. Nearly a hundred aftershocks were recorded in the initial two days of activity.
The largest earthquake during the fourth quarter occurred at OOh07m on October 11 and had a magnitude of 5.5. It was located off the southwest shore of Hawaii and was felt on Hawaii, Maui, and Oahu islands. Also, 2 small flurries of earthquakes were noted in the Kilauea region during October and November: about 60 deep Kilauea shocks during October 28-29, and about 100 shocks from the eastern east rift zone during November 10-17. On December 2, at 22h29m, a deep Kilauea earthquake of magnitude 4.7 was felt on Hawaii, Maui, and Oahu. Several hundred deep Ki-

lauea earthquakes with magnitudes of 0.5 to 4.0 occurred in the week that followed.
STATISTICAL SUMMARY
As in earlier years, IGlauea remained the most seismic region along the Hawaiian Ridge (fig. 5). During 1964, 481 earthquakes of magnitude 2.0 or greater were recorded and located. Of this total, 227 (47 percent) were located beneath Kilauea, 128 (27 percent) were located beneath Mauna Loa, 38 (8 percent) were located beneath Mauna Kea, 8 (2 percent) were located beneath Kohala, 10 (2 percent) were located beneath Hualalai, and the remaining 70 (14 percent) were located offshore. Nearly three-fourths of the total num-
ber occurred beneath the active volcanic systems of
IGlauea and Mauna Loa. One hundred seven earthquakes were reported felt
during 1964. Generally, shocks with magnitude near 3 were felt slightly; those with magnitudes of 4 to 5 were felt throughout the island of Hawaii, and 3 of them were felt on Maui and Oahu islands as well. , Including very small seismic events, 30,285 earth<quakes were detected on the HVO seismic net. A large part of the low-intensity earthquake activity was concentrated in the Kilauea caldera region at depths ranging from near surface to about 5 km. There were commonly 50 to 100 shallow earthquakes of magnitudes 0.5 to 1.5 daily in the Kilauea caldera region.

Earthquake focal depths were relatively shallow, ranging from near surface to about 60 km. Of the 481 earthquakes located and plotted, 289 (60 percent) were less than 10 km deep, 81 (17 percent) were 10-20 km deep, and 111 (23 percent) were 20-60 km deep. Most of the deeper shocks were beneath the Kilauea summit area. The large numbers of quakes along the Kaoiki fault system and the southeast flank of Kilauea strongly augmented the count in the shallower categories.

Minute stellate twin clusters of ferroselite are perched on the sand grains and clay in interstitial openings. None of the ferroselite appears to be enclosed by clay.
SEPARATION AND I·DENTIFICATION OF FERROS·ELITE
A separate of the ferroselite for X-ray and optical studies was made by first gently disaggregating about 50 grams of the friable sandstone and screening. The
< 200-mesh fraction, which contained most of the dis-
lodged ferroselite, was centrifuged in bromoform, and the heavy fraction was washed in acetone. Most of the nonmetallic minerals were removed from the heavy fraction by a flotation process involving n-hexanol and water followed by washing in acetone. Finally, a nearly pure separate of ferroselite was collected in the residue by panning the metallic fraction in either acetone or water on a large watch glass. By this procedure the number and severity of steps were kept to a minimum, and it was possible to get a separation without destroying the delicate twin clusters.
The separate was mixed and ground with a small amount of silicon, which served as an internal X-ray standard. The mixture was mounted on a collodion membrane in an aluminum holder as described by Gude and Hathaway (1962). A chart pattern was run on an X-ray diffractometer with attached monochromatic filter to eliminate all beta radiation and extraneous radiations caused by the high iron content of the mineral. The measurements from the chart pattern were refined, and cell dimensions were calculated by computer by D. E. Appleman, of the U.S. Geological Survey. Theresults are shown in table 1. The cell dimensions are nearly identical with those published by Kullerud and Donnay (1958) for a sample of ferroselite collected by R. G. Coleman, of the U.S. Geological Survey, at Temple Mountain,·Utah.
Several handpicked sand grains with unusual concentrations of ferroselite twin clusters were mounted on gelatin-coated plates for photomicrographs of the twins in place (fig. 2).

present and interstices contain abundant clay. Most sand grains are subangular.
The petrography of the sandstone was not studied in detail. However, the sandstone is composed mostly of quartz, feldspar, and interstitial montmorillonite and has scattered greenish altered flakes of mica and less abundant rounded green grains that may be glauconite. Among the heavy minerals recognized are small amounts of pale-green epidote, red garnet, zircon, pyrite, and ilmenite. Pyrite is very sparse.

DESC:RIPTION OF FERROSELITE
Ferroselite twin clusters are perched only on those sand grains and montmorillonite which border open spaces. Many sand grains, however, are completely enclosed by the clay and other sand grains and are not associated with ferroselite. The number of ferroselite clusters perched on individual sand grains is variable but locally more than a dozen minute clusters are discretely distributed about the surface of very coarse grains.

Stellate twin clusters of ferroselite range from about 0.035 mm to 0.08 mm in diameter. Individual crystals or rays of the stellate clusters range from about 0.004 mm to 0.015 mm in width. In many clusters there seems to be a larger central crystal from which smaller crystals branch (fig. 3).
Details of the twinning scheme and crystallography could not be resolved because of the extremely small size and complexity of the twins. Many of the faces n,re rough, and under high magnification the edges and t-erminations commonly appear to be rounded as if the surfaces were corroded. Attempts were made to study the twins on a universal stage using both oblique and vert·ical illumination but were not successful.
Individual crystals in the twin clusters are orthor-

hombic and have recognizable crystal faces similar to marcasite. If they follow the same pattern as marcasite crystals, the ferroselite crystals are elongate in the direction of the a axis. In cross section most of the crystals are diamond shaped, consisting of the four (Old) prism faces (fig. 3). Some crystals appear to be terminated by a (100) face; ·most, however, are terminated by a macrodome or prism made up of (hkO) faces.
The hYinning scheme appears to be based on a penetration trilling with angles of about 60°; one member of the trilling is commonly a little larger than the others. From the plane of trilling, which may be only parf'ly developed, other crystals emerge, all originating near the center of the trilling. Although the angles

between these extra crystal rays were not accurately measured because of the small crystal size, it appears that they have no regular angular relations either one to the other or to the plane of the trilling. Minute, stubby crystals rio more than one-tenth the length of the trilling twins commonly project from the center but are overshadowed by the larger crystals. At least 10 crystals project from the centers of most twin clusters, and perhaps 20 or more crystals are present In the more completely developed stellate aggregates.
DISCUSSION

evidently destroyed by the strongly oxidizing conditions imposed during development of the hematitic ( ~) environment.
The relations at Ambrosia Lake suggest that this particular ferroselite was formed near the front of an expanding oxidation environment. Presumably, selenium held in solid solution in pyrite was made available to form a seed crystal of ferroselite early in the sequence of events as the pyrite was destroyed, but more complete oxidation destroyed the ferroselite. Consequently, the ferroselite was formed and only was stable just behind the oxidation front in goethitic sandstone.
The ferroselite in the Mrak No. 2 mine also seems to occur just behind a "front" that has encroached on the unaltered sandstone. In this case the "front" gives no obvious evidence of having been produced by an oxidizing environment because of the lack of oxidized iron minerals. In fact, samples BMK-4 and BMK-7 collecte ~ from behind this "front" (Rosholt and others, 1965, p. 204) contained considerable pyrite as well as ferroselite (A. P. Butler, oral commun., June 1965). In this contradictory situation, the pyrite may be later than the ferroselite; there is no evidence to dispute
this. In other deposits in the basin, however, the altered sandstone does contain oxidized iron minerals
presumably from original pyrite (Sharp and Gibbons,
n1964). The presence of gray, reduced( uranium ore

The sizes and shapes of ferroselite twin clusters in the Powder River basin, Wyoming, are similar to those of clusters recently found in the Shirley basin, Wyoming, and in the Ambrosia Lake district, New Mexico. Although other varieties have been reported (Granger, 1963) , descriptions of the Wyoming and New Mexico ferroselite clusters have not yet been published. A brief description of the Ambrosia Lake occurrence is given below.
Deep oxidation in the Ambrosia Lake district locally has affected the uranium deposits and host rocks to as much as several hundred feet below the present water table. In many places the interface between oxidized sandstone and unoxidized pyritic sandstone is quite sharp. The oxidized sandstone is either yellow stained and goethitic or red stained and hematic ( ~). Stellate twins of ferroselite were found in the Section 22 mine (Granger and others, 1961) in a narrow goethitic zone between unoxidized barren sandstone and red oxidized sandstone. Each twin cluster is enclosed by a goethiterich bleb or pseudomorph after pyrite. Pyrite in the unoxidized sandstone generally contains a small amount of selenium, but the red hematitic(~) sandstone has
virtually none. The ferroselite twin clusters were

(Rosholt and others, 1965, p. 201) in a roll :form in advance o:f the altered zone suggests that the altered zone may represent an environment that was oxidizing relative to uranium at the time of uranium deposition.
Experience gained at Ambrosia Lake (Granger and others, 1961; Granger, 1963) indicates that some of the selenium there was carried ahead of the oxidized zone and was precipitated as native selenium. Sharp and others (1964, p. 576 and 597) and Sharp and Gibbons .(1964, p. D41) found native selenium and selenium concentrated in unidentified form in close association with some of the uranium deposits throughout the Powder River basin. These interfaces between altered and unaltered seleniferous sandstones may, therefore, be found consistently to mark abnormal selenium concentrations dominantly in the forms of ferroselite immediately behind, and (or) native selenium immediately in front of, the interface. In the course of exploration for uranium deposits, it might be desirable to make at least qualitative analyses for selenium at any alteration interface regardless of the presence or absence of abnormal radioactivity.
It has been pointed out by D. F. Davidson and H. W. Lakin (oral commun., 1965) that the field observations and interpretations of selenium in relation to the
oxidation interface do not seem to be compatible with
the known chemical behavior of selenium. Selenides, such as ferroselite, represent a more reduced :form of selenium than does native selenium, and it would seem

more reasonable if their positions were reversed on opposite sides of the oxidation interface. This is an important point to consider in interpreting conditions under which some roll-type uranium deposits have formed, and it must be reconciled to complete the picture.

GEOLOGIC AND GEOCHEMICAL FEATURES OF THE REDSKIN GRANITE AND ASSOCIATED ROCKS, LAKE GEORGE BERYLLIUM AREA, COLORADO
By C. C. HAWLEY, CLAUDE HUFFMAN, JR., J C. HAMILTON,
and L. F. RADER, JR., Denver, Colo.

A.bstraot.-Precambrian igneous rocks northwest of Lake George, Colo., consist of (1) catazonal Boulder Creek (?) Granodiorite, (2) mesozonal Silver Plume ( ?) Granite, and (3) epizonal rocks that include gabbro and monzonite, the Pikes Peak Granite, and the Redskin Granite, which is a late intrusive of the Pikes Peak Granite magma series. The Pikes Peak Granite of the area is an alkali granite that contains more than normal amounts ofF, Sn, Li, Rb, and Be-a suite of trace elements generally found in greisen ore deposits. The somewhat younger Redskin Granite, which is herein named, has associated beryllium-bearing greisen. It is also an alkali granite that is enriched in F and contains more Sn, Li, Rb, and Be than the Pikes Peak Granite.

Catazonal intrusive rocks
The oldest rocks of undoubted igneous origin are mesocratic biotite-quartz diorite gneiss and lighter colored orthogneiss which varies from granodiorite to granite in composition. These rocks crop out in the southern part of the Lake George area, where they form concordant sheetlike and phacolithic bodies

The Lake George beryIIiurn area is on the west side of the Front Range, a few miles northwest of Lake George (fig. 1), and is mainly in eastern Park County, Colo. This is a Precambrian terrane whose matrix and oldest element is paragneiss of the Idaho Springs Formation. Younger rocks, including granitic orthogneiss, granite, and more mafic igneous rocks, occur in plutons of different ages that can be grouped into catazonal, mesozonal, and epizonal types, following the usage of Buddington (1959). Because the paragneiss of the Lake George area belongs to the almandineamphibolite facies of regional metamorphism, Buddington's correlation between the metamorphic rank of the host rocks and the zone of emplacement of plutons does not necessarily apply.

GEOLOGY OF THE INTRUSIVE ROCKS
The igneous rocks of the Lake George area are of Precambrian age and were emplaced in three main episodes, each probably of long duration. The threefold sequence probably corresponds to that of the north-central Front Range exemplified by the Boulder Creek Granodiorite, Silver Plume Granite, and Pikes Peak Granite (Tweto, 1965).

older than the Redskin. The only other occurrence of gabbro nearby is in a composite pluton in the Cripple Creek district (Graton, 1906, p. 53-65). The gabbro and associated rocks of the Cripple Creek district can be judged to be relatively young because they are not metamorphosed. They are cut by dikes of the Spring Creek Granite, which forms a local border zone of the

Pikes Peak batholith west of Cripple Creek, but were regarded by Graton as older than the Pikes Peak Granite.
Pikes Peak Granite.-The Pikes Peak Granite occurs in the north and northeast parts of the Lake George beryllium area, which lies along the western flank of the Pikes Peak batholith of the Colorado Front Range. The granite is coarse grained and subequigranular to porphyritic. At most places, it is massive to very faintly foliated, but in some porphyritic facies potassic feldspars are markedly alined in a primary foliation. Locally, the coarse-grained granite is cut by dikes or irregular masses of pegmatite, aplite-pegmatite, and fine-grained granite, and granite porphyry. The aplitepegmatite is a miarolitic rock which contains abundant nearly euhedral crystals of smoky quartz, perthitic microcline, and albite and rare crystals of topaz and fluorite-minerals characteristic of the Pikes Peak Granite.
The granite is classed as epizonal because of its clearly discordant contacts, generally massive structure, and local miarolitic nature. Neither the structural trends nor the mineralogy of the country rocks were apparently affected by the emplacement of this granite.
The age of the Pikes Peak Granite is approximately 1,000 m.y. Hutchinson (1960) reported values of 1,050 and 1,080 m.y. for the northern part of the Pikes Peak batholith, and Aldrich and others (1958) and Giffin and Kulp (1960) found a range of about 980 to 1,060 m.y. in the Pikes Peak and the nearly synchronous Windy Point and Mount Rosa Granites, in the southern part of the batholith. Hutchinson (1964) also reported an age of 995 m.y. for a porphyritic aplite facies of the granite.
Redskin Granite.-The Redskin Granite previously was termed a late facies of the Pikes Peak Granite (Hawley, 1963, 1964), and the Redskin stock was called the Tarryalllobe (Hawley, 1963). The granite is now named the Redskin Granite for Redskin Gulch, in the northern part of the Tarryall 71f2-minute quadrangle, and its type area is the area occupied by the Redskin stock. The Redskin stock of this report was called the Redskin Gulch granite stock by Hutchinson (1964).
The Redskin Granite crops out in the northern part of the Lake George area, in the Redskin stock and in the China Wall and Boomer cupolas (figs. 1 and 2). It is fine to medium grained, white to pink, and mostly a massive granite. Its aplitic and pegmatitic facies are locally miarolitic. The porphyritic facies and the finegrained aplitic granite of the stock and cupolas have
associated berylliurn-bearing greisen deposits.
The Redskin stock is concentrically zoned. The

granular granite that is named the fine-grained facies .(fig. 2) ..Surrounding the..core.is the porphyritic facies, a medium-grained seriate. porphyritic rock. The rocks of the outer zone, named the granular facies, consist of medium-grained equigranular granite. All three facies are composed of microcline that is variably perthitic, quartz, albite (An5- 10 ), and mica. The granular facies is biotitic and contains quartz, microcline perthite, and albite in the proportions 33:43:24. Both the fine-grained and porphyritic types in the stock are 2-mica granites and contain quartz, microcline, and albite in nearly equal proportions; the weighted modal average of all 3 facies in the stock also approaches this ratio (table 1). A fine-grained aplitic granite that forms the Boomer cupola (fig. 2) is a quartzose muscovitic two-alkali-feldspar granite (see table 1). Rocks of similar composition form outer parts of the China Wall cupola and local border zones of the Redskin stock (fig. 2).
Like the Pikes Peak Granite, the Redskin Granite is considered epizonal because of its occurrence in discordant plutons, its generally massive structure, and local miarolitic facies.

The age of the granite and the associated greisen of the .Redskin _stock and Boomer cupola is about 1,000 m.y. (table 2). The lead-isotope ratios have also been determined on the same sampies of microcline from the granite, and these ratios are consistent with 1,000m.y.-old lead (B. R. Doe, written commun., 1964), as is the lead-isotope composition of galena from greisen at the Boomer cupola determined by Antweiler (1965) to be about 1.42, 24.04, 22.13, and 52.41 atom percent of Pb2o4, Pb2os, Pb2o7, and Pb2os.
CHEMISTRY OF THE PIKES PEAK AND REDSKIN GRANITES
Major elements
Chemical analyses made for this study (table 3) and the analyses reported by Hutchinson (1960) show that most of the Pikes Peak Granite is peraluminous alkali granite. The composition is, however, not uniform, and variants as mafic as granodiorite have been found by Hutchinson (1960) in its northern part and by Gottharcl l(raus (written commun., 1960) in its southwestern part.
The granular facies of the Redskin Granite is very similar chemically to the nearby Pikes Peak Granite. The porphyritic and fine-grained facies of the Redskin Granite are more sodic and less potassic than the Pikes Peak Granite (table 3). Fine-grained aplitic granite in local borders to the stock, in the outer part of the China Wall cupola, and in the Boomer cupola, is much more siliceous than the bulk of Redskin Granite, as exemplified by an analysis of granite from the Boomer cupola.
Trace elements
Samples of granite from the Redskin stock, the Pikes Peak batholith, and from representative older igneous and metamorphic rocks were analyzed for Sn, Li, Rb,

and Be. The granular, porphyritic, and fine-grained facies of the Redskin Granite in the stock are each represented, respectively, by 15, 19, and 7 samples (see fig. 2)-the number of samples is approximately proportional to the areal extent of each of these rock types. Granite from the Pikes Peak batholith is represented by 7 samples, and the older igneous and metainorphic rocks by 3 sampies.
Analytical 1nethods.-Tin was determined by the method described by Huffman and Bartel (1964). Acid decomposition of the sample was followed by separation of the tin by anion-exchange resin in dilute (1.4.2J/) hydrochloric acid containing sufficient oxalic acid to make the solution 0.05.2Jf in oxalic acid. The tin w.as then concentrated into a small volume by a carbamate-chloroform extraction and measured as the flavanol complex using a fluorimeter.
Lithium and rubidium were determined on about 50 percent of the samples by a quantitative spectrographic niethod using an alkali buffer to enhance the intensity of the low-energy spectral lines (Ahrens and Taylor, 1961). Subsequently, the rest of the samples were analyzed by the quantitative spectrographic procedure of Annell (1964). In this procedure, the sample is mixed with potassium carbonate and burned in a 16-

amp d-c arc. Selective filtering at the focal plane permits measurable line intensities for the two exposure conditions required. A comparison of 3 analyses determined by using an alkali buffer with those made by the spectrographic procedure of Annell indicates that the results are in substantial agreement (table 4) .
Beryllium was determined by a semiquantitative
spectrographic method (Myers and others, 1961); the results of analyses were, however, reported in a 6-step geometric interval of each power of 10, that is as 1~ 1.5, 2, 3, 5, 7, 10. parts per million, rather than the 3-step interval shown by Myers and others (1961). The re-

suits thus obtained compare favorably with check analyses obtained on six representative samples by a morin-fluorescence method and also by a quantitative spectrographic method (Bastron and others, 1960) as shown in table 5.
Results of analyses.-Partial spectrographic or fluorimetd.c analyses of rocks from the Lake George beryllium area are given in table 6. The range in content of selected minor elements found in the Redskin Granite of the stock is from 7 to 26 ppm of Sn, 16 to 160 ppm of Li; 540 to 1,500 ppm of Rb, and 3 to 20 ppm of Be. The corresponding ranges of values in the nearby coarse-grained granite of the Pikes Peak batholith are from 7 to 13 ppm of Sn, 41 to 100 pm of Li, 400 to 860 ppm of Rb, and 3 to 7 ppm of Be.
Arithmetic and geometric means of individual analyses, according to rock type, are given in table 7. The arithmetic mean (or abundance) can be compared with similar averages generally reported in the geologic literature. The geometric mean, however, is probably a more representative measure of central tendency for a relatively small number of samples.
The Sn, Li, Rb, and Be content of the Redskin Granite is clearly greater than that of the Pikes Peak Granite of the nearby part of the Pikes Peak batholith (table 7). The Redskin Granite is richer in these elements than many other granite bodies of similar bulk composition, but it has about the same amount of these elements as some of the late granite differentiates termed the "tin-granites" by Westerveld (1936). According to Westerveld, the tin granites are similar in bulk composition to their parent rocks, but are distinguished from them by a higher content of rare elements, including Sn, Li, W, Bi, Cu, Co, and U. The name "tin granite" of course comes from the fact that many tin-granite bodies do have associated tin deposits, examples being the granite in Cornwall, Saxony, Pitkaranta, the Transvaal, and the Malayan tin belt, all

listed by Westerveld, and the Australian tin belt '(Rattigan, 1960, p. 1278-1279) , and Seward Peninsula, Alaska (Sainsbury, 1964). In this report granite bodies with abnormally high amounts of tin are described as "tin granites" although other names might be more appropriate. They are compared with other granites with lesser trace-element content which, in a relative sense, are average or barren granites (table 8) .
Onishi and Sandell (1957) proposed that average granite probably contains about 3 ppm of Sn. Further studies tend to confirm their work, thus Hamaguchi and others (1964) found 3.6 ppm of Sn in acidic rocks and Barsukov and Pavlenko (1955) found 3-5 ppm of Sn in ~~ussin,n granite that does not differ "substantially in age or composition from 'tin-bearing granites'." In contrast, the tin content of the Redskin stock (about 16 ppm) is similar to the Seward Peninsula tin granite and possibly to the Cornwall tin granite (table 8). It is slightly less than that of unaltered Rt1ssian tin granite which contains from 16 to 30 ppm of Sn (Barsukov,
1957) and Australian tin granite which averages 21
ppm of Sn (geometric mean) calculated from data of RattiA·an (1963). The tin content of the Pikes Peak

A TWO-AMPHIBOLE GLAUCOPHANE SCHIST IN THE FRANCISCAN FORMATION, CAZADERO AREA, SONOMA COUNTY, CALIFORNIA
By DONALD E. LEE, 1 ROBERT G. COLEMAN, 2 HARRY BASTRON, 2 and VERTIE C. SMITH/ 1 Denver, Colo., 2 Menlo Park, Calif.

Abstraot.-A detailed study of a large glaucophane schist tectonic block has shown that the primary assemblage actinolite-glaucophane-garnet-epidote has been partly replaced by retrograde chlorite and pumpellyite. The whole rock and each of the major mineral phases have been analyzed for major and minor elements. Results of this study are consistent with the hypothesis that the primary metamorphic assemblage represents a high-grade schist that has been dislocated from its bedrock location by upward tectonic movement. The retrograde assemblage may have formed during the period of tectonic dislocation.

Intensive petrologic study of glaucophane schists in

the Cazadero area (fig. 1) has shown that metamorphic

rocks in this area can be divided into three types: II,

III, and IV, in order of increasing metamorphic rank

(type-I rocks are unmetamorphosed) (Coleman and

Lee, 1963). This division into types was made so that

variations in mineralogy and degree of metamorphism

could be rnapped in the field.

The purpose of this paper is to present, in detail,

the mineralogy and petrology of an unusual two-am-

phibole rock belonging to the high-grade type-IV

group. This coarsely crystalline schist occurs as a

large rounded exotic block, about 600 feet in diameter,

resting on bedrock of type-III schist. It occupies the

north bank of Ward Creek in the NE1/4 sec. 17, T.

8 N., R. 11 W., Cazadero quadrangle, Sonoma County,

Calif. (see Coleman and Lee, 1963, fig. 1, or Lee and

others, 1963b, fig. 1).

.

In the Cazadero area, schists of type IV are con-

centrated in a broad layer parallel to serpentinites and

major faults. These isolated coarsely crystalline rocks

(including eclogites) have been interpreted as tectoni-

cally displaced blocks from an unexposed part of a

glaucophane schist terrane. The general problem of

these blocks, as related to the Franciscan metamor-

phism, has recently been discussed by Bailey and others (1964). The mineral assemblages and coarse-grained nature of the type-IV schists indicate that they form under higher pressure-temperature conditions than the type-III bedrock schists on which they rest. Potassium-argon age determinations on muscovite and glaucophane from the type-IV and bedrock schists (types II and II) indicate that these minerals probably formed during the same metamorphic period (Lee and others, 1963b) , about 130 to 150 million years ago.

ROCK DESCRIPTION
The material used for this investigation was collected from the center of the tectonic block. The block as a whole shows irregular compositional layering cut by veins with retrograde miner~ls, and it was not possible to obtain a sample representative of the whole mass. A nearly continuous cover. of moss and other vegetation obscures the internal structure of this block; there is, however, evidence in the hand specimen of at least two periods of deformation.
In hand specimen, the rock is greenish-blue with the platy or micaceous minerals locally concentrated into layers. Reddish garnet (up to 1.5 mm in diameter) is visible and occurs randomly, except in a few layers that are garnet rich. Shears and fractures cutting the rock are filled with pumpellyite and chlorite.

Primary metamorphic-mineral assemblages
In thin section, porphyroblastic garnet occurs in a nematoblastic groundmass of actinolite, glaucophane, and muscovite. Epidote forms irregular anhedral grains intimately associated with the other minerals. Small subhedral grains of sphene ( <0.1 mm in length) are ubiquitous. A few irregularly shaped grains of sphene, up to 1.0 mm in length, contain rutile cores. Apatite porphyroblasts up to 1.0 mm in length are scattered throughout the groundmass.
Actinolite and glaucophane.are present as distinct individual grains, but more often a single amphibole grain may consist of both actinolite and glaucophane. Such relations suggest replacement of one by the other but, as shown in the accompanying drawings, there is no clear evidence that one is earlier than the other (fig. 2). Because the rock does have strong local compositional variations, it is likely that the distribution of the two amphiboles could be controlled by local variations of bulk composition.
Modal analyses of four thin sections taken from the same rock used for chemical analysis and cut at different angles to the schistosity are listed in table 1. The following assemblages are representative of the various compositional layers from different parts of the block:
1. Garnet, muscovite, glaucophane, actinolite. 2. Actinolite, glaucophane, epidote. 3. Actinolite, glaucophane, muscovite, epidote. 4. Actinolite, glaucophane, garnet, epidote, musco-
vite.
Retrograde-mineral assemblages
The distribution of chlorite and pumpellyite is variable, and they are found concentrated within shears and fractures. Commonly these two minerals invade

beyond the vein walls and replace the wallrock minerals. Other retrograde areas, unrelated to late fractures and veins, are replaced by pumpellyite and chlorite. Garnet near the fractures is replaced by chlorite whereas, in other parts of the rock, pumpellyite and minor stilpnomelane may replace garnet. Chlorite selectively replaces actinolite, leaving the intergrown glaucophane unaltered (fig. 2). The epidote, in areas of retrograde alteration near veins, is pseudomorphosed by pumpellyite. Thus garnet, actinolite,

Significance of assemblages
Recalling the earlier mention of sphene replacing rutile, along with those replacement relations just discussed, primary metamorphic and retrograde mineral assemblages must be present and are summarized as :follows:

These observed primary metamorphic and retrograde assemblages indicate that this particular tectonic block has undergone a change :following its original metamorphism. We have earlier postulated that the typeIV rocks have been transported tectonically upward along major fault zones (Coleman and Lee, 1963) and therefore the retrogression observed in this case may relate, in part, to this period of tectonic movement.
GENERAL DISTRIBUTION OF ELEMENTS
In the discussion on systematic mineralogy to follow, calculation of ionic ratios is based on oxide weights that combine the results of chemical and spectrographic analyses. The major elements in the rock and in each of the constituent minerals are presented in table 2 and the minor elements in table 3.
Certain of the metamorphic-mineral structures may be more receptive to a given minor element than :for other minor elements of nearly equal ionic radii under the pressure-temperature conditions of original metamorphism when contrasted with conditions of retrogression. Pb+2 (ionic radius 1.20A) is concentrated in the calcium-rich minerals (ionic radius of Ca+2 is 0.99A) epidote and sphene, but was not detected in pumpellyite (retrograde), garnet, apatite, or actinolite. Also Sr+2 (ionic radius 1.12A) is present in much larger amounts in epidote and apatite than in other calcium minerals. Regarding pumpellyite, a calciumrich mineral, the comparisons drawn are qualified by

the fact that it is retrograde and :fo:nned under different pressure-temperature conditions characterizing the primary metamorphic assemblage. Zircon is not present in this rock; except for its greater concentration in rutile and sphene, zirconium is fairly evenly distributed among the various minerals.
The bulk composition of the rock is considered basaltic (Coleman and Lee, 1963, p. 288); however, the rock does have some characteristics that set it apart :from the typical basalts in the Franciscan Formation (table 2). The Na20 content (0.97 percent Na20) is considerably below the average (3.5 percent Na20) found in the Franciscan metabasalts (unpublished USGS analyses) and the alumina content (17.36 percent Al20a) is considerably above the average (14.2 percent Al20a). This, combined with a low silica content (42.16 percent Si02), gives a very peculiar norm (table 1} that shows minor quartz with abundant hypersthene and wollastonite. Such a composition suggests that some metasomatism prevailed during metamorphism, and that these :factors are largely responsible for the :formation of a two-amphibole rock.
The distribution of minor elements is probably controlled by the ionic radii of the major elements. Ga+3 (0.62A) is confined to the aluminum-rich minerals (A+3, 0.51A), Cr+3 (0.63A) follows Fe+3 (0.64A), Ba+2(1.34A) substitutes for K+1 (1.33A) in muscovite, and Cu+2(0.72A) takes the place of Mg+2(0.66A) in chlorite and Ti+3 (0.76A) in sphene and rutile.
MIN·ERALOGY
Method of ·study
A 5-kilogram sample (USGS lab. No. H-3393, field No. 50-CZ-60) was obtained from the block and approximately 2 kilograms was crushed for chemical analysis and recovery of individual minerals. The final purification of the minerals was accomplished with minus-200 mesh material, using an isodynamic separator and centrifuging in heavy liquids. Specificgravity determinations were made by measuring the liquid used for centrifuging; for the range below 3.32, specific gravity of the bromoform-methylene iodide mixtures was determined by using a specific-gravity balance. For those gravities above 3.32, clerici solution was used and specific gravities were determined by index of refraction measurements on the liquid. Optical constants were determined using sodium light and angular values measured on a 4-axis universal stage. Unit-cell determinations were made using X-ray powder spacings and the least-squares method. The chemical analyses of the rock and minerals were performed

Further work is needed before this parameter can be correlated with the grade of metamorphism.
Another feature of the phengitic micas from glaucophane schists is the strong concentration of barium. Ernst (1963b~ p. 1300, table 1) has reported 2 phengites containing 1.89 and 1.64 percent BaO similar to

Gamet.-The garnet from this rock has been described in a previously published report on garnets frmn the Cazadero area (Lee and others, 1963a). The gn,rnet has a composition (almandine 56.3, grossular 26.7, pyrope 8.3, andradite 5.0, and spessartine 3.7) that is quite similar to that of garnet in other coarse-grained type-IV rocks, including the gar~ets from the associated eclogites (Coleman and others, 1965) ~ These garnets are characterized by a fairly low pyrope content ( <15 percent) and a large amount of ugrandite moles mixed with pyralspites, a distinguishing feature of the garnets characterizing type-IV glaucophane schists.

Accessory. minerals
Enough m·aterial was concentrated during the mineral separation .to obtain chemical information on most of the accessory minerals.
Rutile.-Rutile is ubiquitous in type-IV rocks (Coleman and Lee, 1963) and in this rock 60 mg was recovered.· Spectrographic analysis (table 3) shows that the rutile contains noteworthy amounts of V, Zr, Cr, and Ba. The barium ·(0.48 percent) is puzzling as it is difficult to place a large cation such as this in the rutile structure. Barite is often present in these schists and may well have been present as a minor contaminant

even though optical examination did not reveal its presence in the concentrate.
Sphene.-Sphene is the most abundant .accessory mineral and commonly replaces the rutile. It is well known that sphene may contain appreciable amounts

of many elements besides those appearing in the idealized formula CaTiSi05 (see, for example, Deer and others, 1962, p. 70-73) and this sphene is not unusual in that respect (tables 3, 9) .
Apatite.-The apatite analysis is not complete, as determinations were not made for chlorine or water; therefore, it is difficult to state exactly the end-member components that are represented (table 10). The bulk specific gravity 3.18, and optical properties combined with the chemical analysis suggest that it its a mixture of fluorapatite and chlorapatite.
Pyrite.-A few scattered grains of very fresh-looking ·pyrite were present in the mineral separation; however, there was not enough for analytical work.
Retrograde minerals
Ohlorite.-Chlorite of the type-IV schist is similar in composition (table 11) to those reported from basic schists in the Sanbagawa metamorphic belt of central Sikoku, Japan (Banno, 1964). According to Banno, the Fe+2/Fe+2 +Mg) ratio varies from 0.29 to 0.47, and the Cazadero chlorite has a ratio of 0.47. Chlorites have not been found as a primary and (or) stable mineral in the type-IV schists; therefore, this chlorite must form under conditions distinct from those giving rise to the primary metamorphic assemblage.

The irregular distribution of chlorite and pumpellyite do not allow us to estimate the bulk composition of the retrograde assemblage so that it could realistically be compared with the primary metamorphic assemblage.
The relation between the primary metamorphic minera1s and the retrograde products is best illustrated using the Ernst (1963a, p. 20, 21) "assemblage tetrahedra." This representation allows 13 components of glaucophane schists to be considered as 4 compositional variables. Such a simplification, of course, involves a number of assumptions, some of which are admittedly tenuous but carefully qualified by Ernst. The advantage of the Ernst tetrahedron over the usual ACF diagram is that it makes possible the representation of the_ all?,ite molecule in the sodium-bearing silicates glaucophane, jadeite, and paragonite. One of the special di~advantages of this chemographic treatment results from the fact that muscovite (table 8) contains 3.69 percent MgO, but K 20 is treated as an indifferent component and this does not allow phengitic muscovite to be represented. Bearing in mind this limitation as well as those outlined by Ernst (1963a), we will consider a graphic analysis of the assemblages.

The molecular proportions for the 4 components shown on the

and the rock, and are plotted directly on the diagram.

The theoretical end members upon which Ernst bases his treatment are shown in figure 3 along with the actual compositions established for minerals in sample 50-CZ-60. Because hydrous minerals are present in both the original and retrograde assemblages, it is assumed the PH 2o was equal to or slightly less than the total pressure during the initial metamorphistn and later retrogression. The absence of carbonate minerals indicates that the chemical potential of C02 was extremely low at all times.
The compositions of the original metamorphic minerals are divergent from the theoretical end members (fig. 3). This is particularly true for garnet because of its high grossular content. As noted earlier, the coexisting amphiboles seem anomalous, but when plotted, the degree of "mixing" is seen clearly and the assemblage glaucophane-actinolite-garnet-epidote is permissible with this bulk composition.
To illustrate the relations between the retrograde and initial metamorphic assemblages, the triangular plane Ca0-R20 3-Fm0 from the tetrahedron has chlorite and pumpellyite plotted on the projection (fig. 4). The chlorite-pumpellyite tie line cuts the epidotegarnet and epidote-actinolite tie lines, illustrating that

garnet and epidote are unstable during retrogression and were rephtced by chlorite and pumpellyite. If the bulk composition remains the same during retrogression, then actinolite could remain as a stable or metastable phase. The assemblage pun1pellyte-chloriteglaucophane is typical of the lower grade type-III 1netaba:salt bedrock schists of the Cazadero area. It would appear then that the bulk composition has changed during retrogression because actinolite is being replaced hy chlorite. However, we are not able to estimate the possible bulk composition of the retrograded rock against that ·of the original because of the patchy retrogressive replacement. The possibility exists that retrogression was accompanied by metasomatism. The presence of nearly pure pumpellyite veins replacing the rock suggests that calcium was introduced. Assuming an original basaltic composition, the presence of wollastonite in the norm is further indication of possible calcium metasomatism during retrogression. The geologic position of this exotic high-grade metamorphic tectonic block resting on a lower grade metamorphic bedrock can be explained, in part, by the observed petrologic relations. The two-amphibole high-grade assemblage represents a period of recrys-

Retrogression and perhaps metasomatism developed along fractures as illustrated by the formation of chlorite and pumpellyite, both characteristic of a lower grade of metamorphism. Such retrogression and metasomatism could have transpired during upward tectonic transport.

STRONTIUM-BEARING TODOROKITE FROM SOGANLIYURUK, TURKEY Bv ARTHUR S. RADTKE and LOIS M. JONES, Menlo Park, Calif.

Abstract.-A variety of todorokite with a significant amount of strontium has been recognized in volcanic-sedimentary manganese ores from Soganliyi.iri.ik, Turkey. Optical, physical, chemical, and X-ray powder data are given. Chemical analysis shows the approximate formula of the todorokite to be

Manganese ore containing todorokite from Soganliyiiriik, Turkey (fig. 1), is found in deposits similar in geologic occurrence to the deposits of the Charco Redondo-Taratana district, Cuba. However the todorokite from the Soganliyiiriik deposits contains significant amounts of strontium and is distinct in chemical composition from that found in Cuba. This paper describes the physical, optical, chemical, and X-ray characteristics of the strontium-rich Soganliyiiriik todorokite.

These specimens were studied under the direction of D. F. Hewett, of the U.S. Geological Survey, in conjunction with a Geological Survey research project dealing with mineralogy and geochemistry of stratified manganese deposits. Thanks are due to Charles M. Taylor of Materials Analysis Co., Palo Alto, Calif., for advice and assistance in sample preparation.
OCCURRENCE AND ORIGIN
Todorokite has been identified in manganese ores from two mines, the Soganliyiiriik and Kepez Koy, located in Eregli County of northwest Turkey. Todorokite is the dominant manganese oxide mineral in these ores; pyrolusite is a very minor constituent in both deposits. Minerals associated with todorokite at Soganliyiiriik include pyrolusite, calcite, quartz, montmorillonite, and maghemite. A sample of todorokite ore from Soganliyuriik is shown in figure 2.
In contrast, samples of ore from four other manganese deposits in the same area are massive pyrolusite without associated todorokite. Nahai (1958) states that pyrolusite is the dominant ore mineral in these deposits. In addition to todorokite and pyrolusite, Helke (1955) reports psilomelane, cryptomelane, hausmannite, and manganite.
Manganese ores from deposits near the Black Sea coast of northern Turkey form persistent beds and lenses in marl, tuff, and volcanic flows and breccias. Foraminifera identified in the marls indicate that the rocks are of Late Cretaceous age. The close association of the manganese ores of northern Turkey with volcanic material indicates deposition in shallow marine basins during extensive vulcanism. The ores are classified as volcanic-sedimentary.

ganese oxides is discussed by Hewett and others (1963). The concentration range of the element, according to Hewett's data, is rather uniform in all types of deposits-hypogene veins, hot-spring aprons, and beds.

PHYSICAL PROPERTIES

Todorokite from Soganliyiiriik occurs chiefly as mas-

sive bladed or columnar aggregates and, to a lesser

extent, as irregularly shaped compact botryoidal

masses. The fine-grained todorokite is colloform

banded and porous, resembling zincian todorokite

from Philipsburg, Mont., described by Larson (1962).

The mineral is brownish black in color and streak, and _

has a submetallic luster. Both the bladed and compact todorokite feel greasy and readily smudge the fingers. The Mohs hardness of Soganliyliriik todorokite is less than 2, based on comparison with calcite in polished

OPTICAL AND X-RAY ·PROPERTIES
The optical properties of todorokite were studied in polished and thin sections. Owing to its softness and lack of cohesion, todorokite is difficult to polish satisfactorily, but by trial and error, one method was developed that gave good results. Before the sample was mounted in either cold-setting plastic or bakelite, a flat-sawed surface was impregnated with epoxy resin. The surface was then ground on 2/0 followed by 3/0 emery paper, reimpregnated with diallyl phthalate resin dissolved in acetone, and reground lightly with 3/0 and 4/0 wax-coated emery papers. The sur-

from Soganliyiiri.ik is given in table 2. A semiquantitative spectrographic analysis of the mineral is presented in table 3.
The methods used in the chemical analysis are outlined below: The todorokite was dissolved in a mixture of HF-HC1-H2S04 and evaporated to fumes of S03 ; the total manganese was then determined using sodium bismuthate. The same solution was used for the analysis of sodium by flame photometry, and total iron was determined spootrophotometrically using o-phenanthroline. The interfering manganese was removed by extraction with diethyldithiocarbamate and

of 0.3-micron Al20 3 and water-soluble oil on microcloth.
In well-polished sections under reflected light, the mineral is yellowish brown to light brown and faintly bireflectant. Todorokite is strongly anisotropic, with polarization colors of light reddish brown to midnight blue, and is opaque except in very thin fragments. Attempts to prepare sections sufficiently thin to transmit light for optical study were unsuccessful because the mineral is so poorly cohesive. The indices of refraction are greater than 2.00, and the phase difference is positive.

The alkaline earths were determined by flame photometry on a separate portion of sample, which was dissolved in HF-HC1-HC104 and evaporated to fumes of HC104• Following double precipitation with NH40H, destruction of ammonium ion with HN03, and evaporation almost to dryness, the slurry was then diluted to a suitable volume that was approximately l.OM HC104• Strontium was determined at 460.8 miL; no interference from Ca or Ba was detected in the composition range of the sample. Calcium was determined at 423.3 m,u with no interference from Sr or Ba. The most satisfactory wave length for deter-

Si02, and Fe20 3, were considered to be present in associated Inontmorillonite. Straczek and others (1960), however, thought it possible that Si02, Ab03, and Fe203 are constituents of todorokite.
The empirical formula for strontium-bearing todorokite derived from the chemical analysis is
(Ca,Sr,Mn+2,Mg,Ba,Na2)2(MnH)la02s·7H20.
Assuming 12 oxygen atoms per unit cell (excluding H 20) as reported by Ross (Straczek and others, 1960), the formula may be written as
(Ca,Sr,Mn+2,Mg,Ba,Na2) (Mn+4)6012·3H20.
The 1tfn+2 and Mg may also be included with MnH in the second group. The relatively high MnH content in Soganliytirtik todorokite may be due to a small nmount of admixed pyrolusite.

OCCURRENCE OF PYROPHYLLITE IN THE KEKIKTUK CONGLOMERATE, BROOKS RANGE, NORTHEASTERN ALASKA
By BRUCE L. REED and j. j. HEMLEY, Menlo Park, Calif.

A.bstt·aot.-Pyrophyllite occurs in the matrix of the Upper ( ?) Devonian or Mississippian Kekiktuk Conglomerate. Pyrophyllite may have formed from the alteration of kaolinite or other high-alumina clay minerals during low-grade metamorphism.
The Kekiktuk Conglomerate is a thin, locally absent Upper(?) Devonian or Mississippian conglomerate in the northeastern Brooks Range (Brosge and others, 1962). It underlies the Upper Mississippian Kayak ( ?) Shale and overlies with angular unconformity the Neruokpuk Formation of Devonian or older age. Although the pyrophyllite described here is from the vicinity of Lake Peters (fig. 1), a sample of lithologically similar Kekiktuk Conglomerate (made available by W. P. Brosge) from the Kongakut River also contains considerable pyrophyllite. This sample locality is 80 miles east of Lake Peters and indicates that the occurrence of pyrophyllite in the Kekiktuk Conglomerate is not restricted to the Lake Peters area. Other pre-J(ayak ( ?) quartzite on the south side of the eastern Brooks Range is also known to locally contain pyrophyllite (W. P. Brosge, oral communication, 1965). From the description the pyrophyllite in the Sioux Quartzite (Berg, 1938) appears to be somewhat similar to the pyrophyllite in the Kekiktuk Conglomerate. In the Yakkabag Mountains, in the Soviet Union, Shumara (1965) has described pyrophyllite related to secondary quartzites which are found among volcanogenic rocks. However, the pyrophyllitiz,ation is restricted to the volcanogenic rocks; the associated sedimentary rocks underwent silicification.
STRATIGRAPHY
Ner.uokpuk Formation
In the Lake Peters area (fig. 1) the Neruokpuk Formation consists of interbedded quartz wacke, quartz semischist and phyllite with lesser amounts of chert and conglomerate. Detrital feldspar and rock frag-

ments in the quartz semischist and quartz wacke are each less than 10 percent of the total rock. Mineral assemblages of the wackes., semischists and phyllites commonly include quartz, albite ( <Ans), muscovite, and chlorite. Chloritoid is locally present and epidote is rare. The rocks of the Neruokpuk Formation have been regionally metamorphosed to the quartz-albitemuscovite-chlorite subfacies of the greenschist facies (Turner and Verhoogen, 1960, p. 534-537). The rocks in general possess a well-developed metamorphic fabric, but no evidence of a polymetamorphic history was seen. Uplift occurred subsequent to regional metamorphism and folding, and more than 10,000 feet of Neruokpuk rocks was eroded off prior to Kekiktuk deposition. The contact, where exposed, between the Neruokpuk Formation and the Kekiktuk Conglomerate is sharply defined. Any regolith that may have developed on the erosion surface of the Neruokpuk Formation would have subsequently been removed during the depositional regime of the Kekiktuk Conglomerate.
Kekiktuk Conglomerate
The Kekiktuk Conglomerate is composed of 0 to 350 feet of resistant generally massive irregularly bedded units of quartzite and varying amounts of medium to thick, lenticular beds of pebble and cobble conglomerate. Thin lenses of siltstone are locally present. The siltstone is light to dark gray and weathers light gray and pale yellowish brown to reddish brown. The quartzite consists of medium-grained to granule size angular to subrounded strained and unstrained quartz grains with a few dark-gray chert grains in a matrix of quartz, pyrophyllite, and minor sericite (sericite as used in this paper refers to a very fine-grained 2M muscovite). Secondary quartz overgrowths are locally abundant, but welding and interpenetration of detrital quartz grains are more com-

mon. Interstitial quartz is present as microcrystalline anhedral grains and as clear secondary quartz adjacent. to welded grains. At a few places twinned detrital plagioclase grains occur in the specimens collected. Heavy minerals include tourmaline, ilmenite, magnetite, cassiterite, and rutile. Pebbles and cobbles in the conglomerate consist of quartz, metachert, and a few clasts of phyllite and quartzite. The conglomerate commonly occurs at the base of the formation, although discontinuous beds and lenses are found at higher levels. The general appearance of the formation suo-gests rapid deposition of gravel as sheets or channels, probably as an ancient fluvial deposit of a piedmont or flood-plain type.
Kayak(?) Shale and younger rocks
The Kayak ( ~) Shale consists of argillite and siltstone with limestone occurring near the top of the formation. ~Iississippian through Jurassic limestone,
nsandstone, and shale overlie the Irayak ( Shale (fig.
1); these rocks do not contain pyrophyllite. They are metamorphosed however, and slaty cleavage is locally developed. Igneous rocks are not present in the Lake Peters area.

OCCURRENCE OF PYROPHYLLITE
Pyrophyllite occurs as a matrix mineral in the quartzite and conglomerate of the l(ekiktuk Conglomerate. Of 22 samples examined (collected throughout the map area) 20 contain pyrophyllite. It also
noccurs in minor amounts in the underlying Neruokpuk
Formation and the overlying Kayak( Shale. It is restricted, however, to within a few feet of both contacts with the Kekiktuk Conglomerate. Pyrophyllite in quartzite is easily overlooked in the field. A thin yellowish-gray film of pyrophyllite fills the interstices between quartz grains, and the characteristic soapy feel of pyrophyllite is absent even in specimens containing as much as 30 percent (by weight) pyrophyllite. Because pyrophyllite is difficult to distinguish from sericite in thin section, positive identification was n1ade by X-ray diffraction.
The pyrophyllite occurs as fine compact feltlike aggregates of small clear crystals that range from 0.02 to 0.1 mm in length. It occurs in slightly broader platy crystals than does the less common sericite. The larger crystals of pyrophyllite occasionally form poorly developed radiating rosettes. Its birefringence is high, and 2V is greater than 45 °.

C164

MINEHALOGY AND PETROLOGY

Pyrophyllite fills interstices between quariz grains and replaces the original matrix, quartz overgrowths, and detrital quartz grains (fig. 2). In places pyrophyllitization is so complete that it is difficult to identify the original texture of the replaced matrix. Small irregular patches of unreplaced quartz are locally present within the pyrophyllite; in extreme cases of pyrophyllitization there is an absence of original detrital quartz outlines, and only isolated, embayed fragments of the original quartz grains remain (fig. 3). Strained quartz grains show a greater tendency for replacement than do unstrained grains. As much as 40 percent (by weight) of pyrophyllite may be present in some samples, but in general it makes up less than 20 percent of the rock. X-ray diffraction patterns show 2M muscovite as a minor constituent in 11 of the samples.

STABILITY FIELD OF PYROPHYLLITE
The upper stability limit of kaolinite and of kaolinite in equilibrium with quartz has been the subject of considerable experimental work (Roy and Osborn, 1954; Carr and Fyfe, 1960). Unfortunately the results of these studies, although sometimes quoted in literature, cannot be taken as the thermodynamic stability limit of kaolinite. They are based either upon gel crystallizations or upon short-term unreversed thermal decomposition runs. The true limit of stability is therefore lower, and perhaps considerably lower, than these findings would indicate.

In a pure water environment Remley and Jones
+(1965) observed the reaction kaolinite quartz to
pyrophyllite in the region of 380°C, 1,000 bars PH2o (partial pressure of water), in runs of moderate (several weeks) duration. The reaction is:
In earlier work (Remley, 1959), decomposition te mperatures 20° to 30°C lower than this were realized in a dilute electrolyte environment (water activity still very close to that of pure water at the given pressure and temperature). More important, however, is the result of a run of long duration (1 year) in which pyrophyllite was produced from kaolinite plus quartz (Remley, unpublished data) at 300°C and 1,000 bars PH o. A stability limit no higher than about 300°C at
2
1,000 bars is thus indicated. This observation has been further corroborllted by extensive solubility work on kaolinite and pyrophyllite by Remley in the same experimental program, the results of which are being compiled for publication. Finally, it is apparent that at lower water pressures and higher silica activities the upper stability limit of kaolinite would be further depressed. These controls have important implications to the present geological discussion.
A possible origin for the pyrophyllite that is consistent with the quartz-pyrophyllite-sericite assemblage is summarized below. Extensive weathering of the Neruokpuk Formation, and the depositional regime associated with the profound unconformity at the base

of the J(ekiktuk Conglomerate, produced a quartzite containing minor clay minerals, particularly kaolinitetype clays, but relatively free of feldspar or other mineral contaminants. During folding and low-grade metamorphism, pyrophy1lite was formed by reaction of kaolinite with associated quartz.1
Lenses of si1tstone within the quartzite, which probably had a high content of clay minerals originally, contain considerably more pyrophyllite than does the quartzite. This suggests that clay minerals were the source of the alumina required to form pyrophyllite. The temperatures and pressures at which pyrophyllite formed are uncertain. Temperatures may have been as much as 300°C, but most likely were much lower. The preserved thickness of rocks overlying the Kekiktuk Conglomerate is about 5,000 feet. However, there may have been an additional 5,000 feet or more of younger sedimentary rocks (post-Jurassic) that have been eroded off. In any event a lithostatic pressure of from 400 to 900 bars is indicated. Water pressure, on the other hand, may have been 1nuch lower than this lithostatic pressure. Also, the kaolinite to pyrophyllite transition should be favored not only by low PH2o, but also by a large differential between total pressure (including some possible tectonic overpressure) and in itself fn.vors the phase of higher density and lower the PH o, in the rock inasmuch as confining pressure

hydration and entropy (Fyfe and others, 1958). Because quartz is present as a major constituent,
aqueous silica concentration was probably at least equivalent to quartz saturation in the pore fluid phase, but supersaturation may also have developed at least locally during metamorphism. Lithostatic stress on contacts between quartz grains would increase their solubility, causing solution and redeposition of silica. This increase in aqueous silica concentration would favor the reaction between silica and clay minerals. Strained quartz grains would tend to show preferential replacement by pyrophyllite inasmuch as grains in such a state have a decreased thermodynamic stability. That
the fabric of the rock points to the operation of these
processes is evidenced by petrographic features described in a previous paragraph.
Thus, there is no apparent inconsistency between

this geologic setting. The most important requisite for pyrophyllite formation under the pressure and temperature conditions of low-grade metamorphism is a bulk composition relatively pure in alumina-silica. 'Vhere such conditions are not 1net, chlorite, muscovite, and other typical greenschist minerals are produced. For example, the overlying Kayak argillite contains predominantly 2M muscovite and chlorite. Although pyrophyllite is confined essentially to the Kekiktuk Conglomerate, it does occur in the overlying J(ayak ( ~) Shale and underlying Neruokpuk Formation. It is confined in these rocks, however, to within a few feet of the contacts. This limited distribution apparently reflects the influence of the conglomerate as the source of the silica during metamorphism, .which locally migrated into the overlying and underlying rocks and reacted with pockets of aluminous clay minerals to form pyrophyllite. Minor potassium is also present in 1\::ekiktuk quartzite, reflected by the occurrence of minor sericite.
Low-grade metamorphism (greenschist facies) can yield pyrophyllite from the appropriate bulk composition with or without the presence of water as a phase. On the basis of the similarity of pyrophyllite to sericite in thin section, the apparent scarcity of pyrophyllite in low-grade metamorphic rocks may be more apparent than real. More X-ray work in the future will resolve this question. Furthermore, sediments, soils and weathering products rich in Al and Si and low in associated cations (kaolinitic-type materials) are not rare geologically. Therefore if pyrophyllite is indeed a rare mineral in quartzose metamorphic sections, it would imply that metasomatic processes (such as K introduction to form sericite) apparently accompany low-grade metamorphic processes in most instances.

GENETIC IMPLICATIONS OF SOME ELEMENTS ASSOCIATED WITH URANIUM DEPOSITS, SHIRLEY BASIN, WYOMING
By E. N. HARSHMAN, Denver, Colo.

.t.lbstract.-A systematic distribution of uranium, selenium, . ferrous and ferric iron, carbon, beryllium, and sulfate sulfur is shown by analytical data. on samples of unaltered sandstone, ore, and nltered sandstone from a roll-type uranium deposit in the lower Eocene 'Vind River Formation of the Shirley basin. Transportation of uranium and other elements in n neutral to slightly alkaline, oxidizing solution and deposition by chunges in the Eh and pH of that solution are suggested by the geochemistry of these elements at low temperatures nnd pressures.
Field and laboratory investigations of unoxidized uranium deposits in sandstone have resulted in considerable data on the possible sources of uranium and the geochemistry of its solution, transportation, and deposition. In spite of these data, and perhaps because uranium is a widely distributed element, easily. dissolved and transported by solutions of diverse character, there is little agreement on the genesis of the deposits.
It is improbable that any one genetic concept can be applied to all uranium deposits in sandstone, for each has its own peculiarities of detail. On the other hand, most deposits have similarities that suggest that certain broad geochemical proceses may have been responsible for their origin.
C. F. Davidson (1964) suggests that "in geological
theorizing it is wise to extrapolate from the known to the unknown, from the young to the old, from the simple to the complex." The Shirley basin uranium deposits are young, simple in form, and since their formation, apparently unaffected by significant redistribution of uranium or by weathering. In this paper certain physical and chemical data, and genetic concepts interpreted from these data, are presented. Extrnpolation of the concepts to older and more complex deposits is not attempted.

GEOLOGY AND ORE DEPOSI:TS
The major uranium deposits in the Shirley basin (fig. 1) are in a well-defined belt coincident with the lowest part of a basin filled with clastic and tuffaceous rocks of fluviatile and lacustrine origin. The basin was eroded in rocks of Cretaceous and older age, and was filled with rocks ranging in age from Eocene to Miocene that aggregated at least 1,500 feet in thickness. The ore deposits are in sandy beds of the Wind River Formation of early Eocene age which rests unconformably on the Cretaceous and older rocks.
Near the deposits, the Wind River Formation ranges from 300 to 500 feet in thickness. It is composed of clayey siltstone, arkosic sandstone, and conglomerate, all interbedded and poorly cemented. The sediments for the most part were derived from granitic rocks to the west. Regional dips are about 1° northward. Plant. and vertebrate fossils indicate that the early Eocene environment was subtropical. Carbonaceous trash is abundant in the fine-grained rocks in the lower part of the basin and common in the sandstones interbedded with them.
The present ground-water table is at depths of a few feet to more than 300 feet below the ground surface. Ground water is tributary to the present surface drainage system and flows southward at gradients of 10 to 30
feet per mile. The principal anions in the ·Shirley basin ground
water are bicarbonate (210 parts per million) and sulfate (110 ppm) as shown by analyses of 25 water samples collected by the writer from the Wind River Formation. Radioelements include uranium (20 parts per billion) , radiurn (10 picocuries per liter) , and radon (as much as 200,000 pc/liter). The pH of the ground water ranges from 6.6 to 8.3; the median pH is about 7.8.

Large tongues of altered 1 sandstone, formed in the most transmissive parts of thick sandstone beds, were the ·loci for ore deposition. Two such tongues at different stratigraphic levels have been delineated by exploration and development drilling, and the upper tongue has been partly exposed by mining operations in the Petrotomics Co. open pit and in the Utah Construction and Mining Co. mine 2lj2 miles to the north. A third tongue, possibly a split from the upper tongue, may be present locally. Data on it are meager, and it is not discussed in this report. The upper tongue is 5 miles long in a northwesterly direction and has a maximum width of 3 miles. It is at depths of 100 to 450 feet below the ground surface and is as much as 200 feet above the base of the Wind River Formation. The upper tongue ranges in thickness from a few feet near its edge to about 70 feet, several thousand feet back from the edge.
The lower tongue is separated from the upper one by 50 to 70 feet of silty claystone. It has not been exposed by mining operations, but drilling data sug-

gest that it is similar to the upper tongue. In part, the two tongues are superimposed, although the upper tongue extends farther to the north and west than does the lower one.
The major ore bodies in the Shirley basin are at the margins of tongues of altered sandstone in a curved zone between altered and unaltered sandstone. An ore body in its most simple form is crescent shaped in cross section, has a sharp contact with altered sandstone on the concave side, and grades into unaltered sandstone on the convex side. Ore bodies are elongate paraJlel to the margins of the altered sandstone tongues. Ore bodies of this configuration are commonly known as rolls.
Epigenetic minerals in the ore are uraninirte, pyrite, marcasite, calcite, hematite, native(~) selenium, and an unidentified sulfate mineral; in altered sandstone they are goethite, limonite, and ferroselite.
The geology and ore deposits of the Shirley basin are discussed in more detail in papers by Harshman (1961, 1962), ~{elin (1964), and Rosholt and others (1964). Similar deposits in Russia have been described, most recently by Kashirtseva (1964).

samples in the channels were broken at each observed

mches to 10 :feet in length. Fifty-six samples were

collected, consisting, from west to east, of (1) un-

altered and unmineralized sandstone, (2) ore, and (3)

alterec~ sandstone. All samples were analyzed for U,

Figure 2B shows graphically the selenium content

selenium content of most the moderate selenium

most of the altered sandstone, 10 to 60 ppm. The

the analyses plotted on figure 2B, but not shown, be-

cans~ of sample locations, is the large amount of

Analyses of close spaced samples from ore bodies in

the Petrotomics pit and the Utah mine show that ~elenium in amounts of as much as 1,200 ppm occurs In a zone about 1 foot wide parallel to, and extending about 6 inches each way from, the contact between altered sandstone and ore.
The distribution of ferrous and ferric iron as well as the amounts of ferrous iron in pyrite are shown on figures 20 and D. Of interest are: (1) a ferrous/ ferric ratio of a.bout 2 to 1 in the samples of unaltered sandstone most distant from ore and therefore least affected by ore deposition, in contrast to a ferrous/ ferric ratio of about 1 to 1 in the samples of altered sandstone most distant from ore; (2) the nearly equal amounts of total iron in both altered and unaltered ~andstone ~a~ples distant from ore; (3) the decrease In. the. ferric _1ron content of altered sandstone samples WIth .Increa~Ing pro~imity to ore; (4) the high ferrous Iron, lngh total Iron, and low ferric iron contents of ore; and (5) the absence of pyritic ferrous iron (pyrite) in altered sandstone except for minor amounts near the contact with ore. Similar iron distributions ar.e shown by analyses of sample suites from the Utah mine.
Analyses for carbon are shown on figure 2E. They confirm observations made in the open pit that:· (1) moderate but erratic amounts of carbonized fossil plant debris are contained in ore and unaltered sandstone, (2) very minor amounts of such debris are present in the outer few feet of the altered sandstone tongues, and (3) no carbonized debris is present in the ~ltered sandstone from the interior of the tongues.
Minor amounts of beryllium are associated with uranium in the Shirley basin deposits. Of the 20 samples shown on figure 2A, ore samples 312 and 319 contain 0.00015 percent Be, all other samples contain less than 0.0001 percent, the lower limit of detectability. The following Be distribution is shown when the analyses of these 20 samples are combined with the analyses of 145 samples from the Utah mine and the Petrotomics open pit :

debris, uranium, and selenium found in altered sandstone near the contact with ore are believed to represent the leached remnants of former ore bodies. Particularly indicative of leaching are the corroded pyrite grains seen in heavy-mineral separates from altered sandstone in the Petrotomics pit, and described by ~1elin (1964) from altered sandstone in the Utah mine. These corroded grains contrast with the euhedral pyrite grains characteristic of ore and unaltered sandstone.
CONCLUSIONS
The geochemistry of certain elements associated with uranium in the Shirley basin ore deposits suggests that the ore-bearing solution was neutral to weakly alkaline and oxidizing ground water. It probably dissolved uranium and other elements from tuffaceous and arkosic sedimentary rocks that once filled the basin. The solution migrated through the porous sandy members of the Wind River Formation and moved from the flank of the basin down the hydraulic gradient toward the lower part of the basin. As the solution moved basinward its oxidation potential was lowered by reaction with the minerals in the sandstone, particularly pyrite, and by intermixing with reducing solutions buffered by H 2S of biogenic origil)-. Ore deposition is known to have occurred at depths of as much as 500 feet below the ground surface, a depth at which deposits are now found, and it may have occurred at depths of as much as 1,500 feet, the .estimated thickness of Tertiary rocks that once filled the basin. Deposits formed in a narrow zone where the oxidation potential of the solution was reduced below that required for continued transportation of uranium and the associated elements. The spent ore-bearing solution, considerably changed chemically, passed beyond the zone of the ore deposition and eventually was discharged from the basin.

Th~ zone of deposition is considered to have been a dynamic feature migrating basinward by oxidation and solution of ore on the updip side of the zone and by reduc.tion and redeposition on the downdip side. Oxidation of pyrite on the updip side probably resulted in a sharp drop in the pH of the ore-bearing solution, but as these solutions passed through and beyond the zone of deposition, normal alkalinity would be restored by reaction with arkoses in the Wind River formation. Approximations of Eh and pH values believed to have been controlling factors in the solution, transportation, and deposition of uranium and associated elements in the Shirley basin deposits are shown on figure 3.
The processes described in this report as responsible for the genesis of the Shirley basin uranium deposits are similar to genetic processes by which secondary sulfide deposits are formed. In the formation of both types of deposits there are: (1) oxidation and solution of selected elements on the updip side of a mineralized zone, (2) a rather sharp drop in the pH of the water due to oxidation of pyrite, (3) downward migration of the water and its dissolved elements, and (4) reduction and redeposition of the dissolved elements. In addition, the gossans characteristic of many secondary sulfide deposits and the altered sandstone characteristic of the Shirley basin uranium deposits are similar chemically and in their position relative to ore. The concept of deep secondary enrichment may have application, along with other ore guides, in exploration for uranium deposits.

METAL SORPTION BY NORTHWEST FLORIDA HUMATE
By VERNON E. SWANSON, IRVING C. FROST, LEWIS F. RADER, JR., and CLAUDE HUFFMAN, JR., Denver, Colo.

Abstraot.-Experiments with both natural and chemically extracted humate indicate that thi~ water-soluble organic material from Florida can sorb between 1 and 17 percent by dry weight of cobalt, copper, iron, lead, manganese, molybdenum, nickel, silver, vanadium, and zinc. The enrichment of metals in ancient carbonaceous sedimentary rocks may be due in part to humate that acted as a scavenger or sponge for metals during exposure to metal-bearing natural water before, during, or shortly after deposition. Because of its metalsorptive properties, large tonnages, and thin, easily removed overburden of loose sand, the Florida humate may find use in the chemical and fertilizer industries.
The metal content of carbonaceous rocks is commonly high, but the kinds and amounts of the metals are highly variable. Reasons for this variability are many and undoubtedly complex, and at present are very poorly understood. Krauskopf (1955, p. 456) ended his very thorough review of the geology and geochemistry of the distribution and enrichment of metals in sedimentary rocks with this succinct summary:
The principal stumbling block [in understanding the enrichment of metals in sedimentary rocks] is usually the organic matter; it has become abundantly clear that certain metals are preferentially associated with particular kinds of organic matter, and that these different kinds represent different depositional environments, yet the differences are not apparent to field observation or even to some laboratory tests. Research aimed at setting up tests for the significant varieties of organic matter . . . would help immensely not only in building up a theory of . . . metal deposition but also in the practical problem of prospecting.
Investigations are now underway to decipher the genesis and geologic role of one of these kinds of organic matter-humate, a water-soluble, coal-like material found in sediments (Swanson and Palacas, 1965, p. B2-B3). The solubility characteristics of humate, and its distinctive capacity to sorb 1 and re-

tain large amounts of many different metals, are believed to explain, at least in part, the concentration of metals in many carbonaceous rocks.
The humate discussed here is soluble organic material deposited in the past and also accumulating today in the dune and beach sands along the Gulf of Mexico in north,,est Florida (fig. 1). The distribution, chemical composition, and probable origin of this humate have been described by Swanson and Palacas (1965). The preliminary results of experiments to determine the sorption capacity of the humate for 10 metals are reported here.
SAMPLE MATERIAL
T"·o types of samples were used in the laboratory tests: (1) humate-impregnated sand, just as collected jn the field, which was used to test the sorption of six metals, and (2) humaJte extracted from the sand by

alkaline solution and which was used to test the sorption of 10 metals. This latter m·U~terial, when extracted by alkaline solution and precipitated with dilute acid, is comn1only designated as humic acids. However, when this material is precipitated as a salt of humic ·acids, whetJ1er by calcium, magnesium, or iron, as is common in nature, or when combined with metals as described here, the term humate is applicable (Horner 'and others, 1934) and is so used in this report.
The humate-impregnated sand was collected on the shore of the northwestern part of Choctawhatchee Bay, Fla. (near center sec. 4, T. 2 S., R. 23 W.). The sand, which is dark brownish black when wet and brown when dry, contained 9.0 percent humate and 5.4 percent organic carbon. The 5.4 percent carbon is equivalent to an estimated 9.2 percent total organic matter. The medium- to fine-grained sand is mainly composed of quartz grains, with less than 5 percent clay.
1Vhen dried, the humate extracted from the sand by alkaline solution is a jet-black lustrous coal-like material with a conchoidal fracture. It contains 45.0 percent organic carbon and 7.12 percent ash. Ultimate analysis of this humate was not obtained, but the carbon determination of 45.0 percent and the ultimate analyses of very similar material (Swanson and Palacas, 1965, table 2) suggest that the humate had an approximate moisture- and ash-free content of 48.5 percent carbon, 4.5 percent hydrogen, 45.5 percent oxygen, 1.0 percent nitrogen, and 0.5 percent sulfur.
PROCEDURES AND RESULTS
The 10 metals used in the sorption tests were silver, cobalt, copper, iron, manganese, molybdenum, nickel, lea.d, vanadium, and zinc. These metals were dissolved in triply distilled wn.ter in their salt form as AgN03, CoClz.6HzO, CuS04.51IzO, FeC13.6H20, MnCl2.4HzO, (NH., )GMo7024.4Hz0, NiS0 4.6H20, Pb(N03)z, Nfi.,V08, and ZnCl2, respectively. The amount of metal ions added in solution in each test was sufficient to permit the humate to sorb as much as 2'0 percent metal by dry weight.
The tests to determine the metal-sorption capacity of the humate-impregnated sand were run by simply adding the metal-containing solution to a 10-gram sample of lightly crushed sand. The samples were stirred intermittently for 24 hours, then were centrifuged, thoroughly washed twice with distilled water, dried, and ru1alyzed for metals by the spectrographic method. A control sample without any metal added was run with each set of samples. The results for the

six metals tested are shown in table 1. On the basis of these semiquantitative values and the fact that the sand contained 9 percent humate, the metal-sorption capacity of the humate is on the order of 1 to 10 percent.

The tests to determine the metal-sorption capacity of the isolated humate were run in a similar manner, except that the metal solution was added while the humate was in solution. This humate was obtained by extraction from sand with 0.1N NaOH, followed by centrifuging and filtering twice to remove clay and particulate organic material from the humate solution. Precipitation of the humate, with its sorbed metal, was accomplished either by addition of the metal solution, or by lowering the pH of the solution to about 2.5 with 6N MCl. After centrifuging and thorough washing twice, the black humate gel was dried and analyzed by methods indicated in table 2. The simplified experimental procedure that was used did not preclude the possible inclusion of a small but unknown amount of metal hydroxide that may

have been sorbed by, or coprecipitated with, the humate.
A comparison between the chemically extracted humate and natural or untreated humate shows that the two are very similar, in appearance and also chemically (table 3), particularly in carbon and sulfur content, though some of the major ions, such as calcium, magnesium, and iron, are apparently stripped from the humate during chemical extraction. The natural humate sample was taken from the cast of a Pecten-type shell in humate-cemented sand (Swanson and Palacas, 1965, p. B10, B17). The original calcareous shell had been dissolved by subsurface water and completely replaced by black humate.
The large metal-sorption capacity of the Florida humate, whether dispersed in sand or chemically extracted from the sand, is generally from 1 to 17 percent, as shown in tables 1 and 2, though the values shown should be considered as approximate because of the simplified experimental procedures used.
The results shown are comparable to the results of other workers who tested the metal-sorption capacities or metal content of different kinds of organic matter. Some of these other studies involved peat, dopplerite, lio-nite, soil humus, humic acids, and humate (Aschan,

ECONOMIC CONSIDERATIONS
The main result of this study of metal sorption by the Florida humate is that a probable geochemical process is indicated whereby metals could have been concentrated in an ancient organic-rich sandstone that was deposited in a similar coastal environment. Also, it is suggested that the metal-sorption property of the Florida humate may be of economic use. In northwest Florida, surprisingly large tonnages of humate that could be extracted simply and cheaply were discovered during this study and may potentially be suitable for nse in the chemical and fertilizer industries. Six of the metals used in this study, cobalt, copper, iron, manganese, molybdenum, and zinc, are known to be essential micronutrients for plant and animal metabolism (Mitchell, 1964, p. 320), and are widely used in fertilizer and animal-feed additives. The biochemical function or importance of the other four metals tested, silver, nickel, lead, and vanadium, is not known, though these metals are commonly concentrated in plants, in

the humus of soils, in aquatic organisms, and In organic-rich sediments.
An ever-present problem in the biologic use of micronutrient-metal additives has been to find a substance or form that permits the required kinds and amounts of metals to he easily assimilated by plants and animals. Additional requirements of the micronutrient compound are that it will be nontoxic, that it will not break down or chemically combine with other constituents to result in an "unavailable" form, that it is easy to apply, and that it is inexpensive. Synthetically prepared metal chelates ('\Vallace, 1956) have been proven to meet most of these requirements, particularly for iron, manganese, and zinc additives, though these chelates, such as EDTA (ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid), are relatively expensive. The composition, solubility, and metal-sorption properties of the Florida humate strongly suggest that it may find a use as a natural or processed chelating agent, though extensive biologic and agronomic tests will be necessary to establish its usefulness.
It seems probable that the Florida humate could be easily and cheaply mined and processed. The humaterich sand, which in itself is soft or semifriable, is concentrated at a depth of generally less than 35 feet from the surface, suggesting easy removal by shallow openpit mining methods. It is estimated that 100,000 to 1,000,000 tons of humate are present per square mile in discontinuous beds at a depth of less than 35 feet over an area of 300-500 square miles along the northern coast of the Gulf of Mexico (Swanson and Palacas, 1965, p. B11, fig. 1). Simple drying, light crushing, and sieving of the humate-rich sand produces a powder that is 60 to 75 percent humate. Another seemingly attractive aspect of the humate is its almost-

instantaneous solubility, for example, in ammonia. A1nmonia is widely applied in liquid form to soils as a nitrogen fertilizer. Humate is also soluble in a potassium phosphate (l\:3P04) solution, and might also provide the other 2 of the 3 major constituents of fertilizers-potassium and phosphorous.
Other possible, but untested, uses of the physically separated or chemically extracted humate are as a water purifying compound, as an additive in welldrilling fluids, as a wood stain or paint pigment, and as a metal seavenger in a variety of commercial processes.

NEW ISOTOPIC MEASUREMENTS OF COLORADO ORE LEADS
By M. H. DELEVAUX, A. P. PIERCE, and j. C. ANTWEILER,
Denver, Colo.

Abstract.-Seventy-six mass spectrometric analyses were made by electron bombardment of Pbl2, during which 36 runs on a lead reference sample, GS/4, showed standard deviations from the mean for isotopic ratios of 206/204, 206/207, and 206/208 of 0.21 percent, 0.09 percent, and 0.11 percent, respectively. Ten samples were mass spectrometrically analyzed by thermal emission of PbS, during which 18 runs on the same reference sample showed percent standard deviations in the three ratios of 0.12 percent, 0.06 percent, and 0.12 percent, respectively. In contrast, the range in natural variations was many times greater: from the Yule marble quarry, Gunnison County, the isotopic ratios were 206/204=--~ 24.15, 207/204=16.24, and 208/204=41.62, compared to 15.76, 15.35, and 35.42 in a sample from the High Lonesome mine in Grand County.

The present study was undertaken to extend knowl-

edge of isotopic variations in lead minerals of ore de-

posits in central Colorado. A previous study of iso-

topic compositions of galena from 12 deposits in this

region was made by Phair and Mela (1956), and iso-

topic analyses of galena from several other deposits

are listed by Bate and others (1960). Their early

objective in sampling was to ascertain the isotopic varieties and range in isotopic composition of Colorado ore lead. This objective was met by sampling (1) deposits inside and outside the Colorado mineral belt, (2) deposits of presumed Precambrian age and presumed Tertiary age, and (3) deposits in diverse-sedimentary, igneous, and metamorphic-geologic settings. Sample locations are plotted in a general way on the sample locality map (fig. 1), and are given more specifically, by longitude and latitude, in table 1.

Detailed descriptions of the samples are reserved for subsequent publications which will deal with geologic interpretations. All the samples are galena, with or without other primary sulfides, excepting samples DSw254 (anglesite) and DSw319 (trace lead concentrated by acid extraction of a tungsten ore specimen) .
PREPARATION OF SAMPLES
Galena concentrates or other lead minerals of high mineralogic purity were obtained from all samples where possible; a limited amount of material containing sparse or trace amounts of lead minerals is all

that was available for a few samples. A mineralogically pure lead mineral was obtained from some samples by handpicking, drilling, or sawing. In many of the samples, however, the galena was too fine grained for handpicking and was separated by a twostep procedure that consisted of removing light minerals by floating in bromoform, followed by heavyliquid superpanning of the heavy minerals in a closed tube. A few samples were purified by other techniques such as electromagnetic separation, or selective solution of impurities-as, for example, dissolving. away carbonate impurities with 10-percent formic acid.

DE'LEVAUX, PIE'RCE, AND ANTWEIILE'R

C181

Some galena concentrates were cleaned with 10-percent potassium hydroxide to remove cerussite or other oxidation products.
Mineralogically pure lead minerals were further purified chemically by the method described by Antweiler (1963). That method consists of dissolution of the lead mineral in hot dilute (1 :1 v/v) nitric acid followed by four precipitations of lead nitrate in very strong (sp gr i.42 or higher) nitric acid, and conversion of the purified lead nitrate to iodide or to sulfide for isotopic analysis. The lead compound analyzed was lead iodide in samples DSw205 through DSw318 and in DSw333 and DSw334 (table 1A..). Lead sulfide was analyzed in samples DSw324 through DSw330 (table 1B). Both compounds were analyzed for samples DSw319 through 323.
The effects of impurities on lead-isotope analyses are not definitely known, but were minimized in the present work by the combination of mineralogic and chemical purification techniques that resulted in ore-lead samples of exceptionally high purity. A few analyses were made on samples of somewhat lesser purity. The first four samples, DSw205 through DSw210, were prepared before the nitrate method (Antweiler, 1963) was developed. The quantity of lead available in two samples, DSw246 and DSw319, was so small that only 1 precipitation in nitric acid rather than the usual 4 was made.
MASS SPECTROMETRY
All the samples in this study were analyzed by M. H. Delevaux in the Washington laboratory of the U.S. Geological Survey. Most of the samples (table 1) were analyzed from ]\{arch 1962 to February 1963 on the mass spectrometer previously described by Delevaux (1963). This was a 12-inch radius, 60° sector Nier-type mass spectrometer using electron bombardmen,t of Pbi2• The data were taken from a strip-chart recorder, and each ratio represents the average of four measurements of the Phi+ signal. All measurements were taken using magnetic scanning and accelerating potential of 4,500 volts and at pressures below 1Q-6 mm of mercury. Ion currents, measured by a vibratingreed electrometer, were usually of the order of magnitude of 2 X 10~11 amperes. For each analysis four double scans of the Phi+ spectrum were made. Resolution in terms of the ratio of Pb207 peak to Pb208 -Pb207 valley was usually in the range of 250 to 300.
Ten samples were analyzed later (table 1B), in August and September 1963, on a mass spectrometer newly assembled for the Geological Survey in Washington by W. R. Shields of the National Bureau of . Standards. This instrument is a 12-inch radius, 68° sector, solid-source mass spectrometer which uses ther-

The data were taken from a strip-chart. recorder, and each ratio represents an average of six 1neasurements. All measurements were taken using the peak-hopping method at an accelerating potential of 10,000 volts and a pressure below 2 X 10-7 mm of mercury. Ion currents were usually of the order of magnitude of 8 X 1Q-12 amperes, as measured by a vibrating-reed electrometer. Resolution in terms of the ratio of Pb207 peak to Pb208 -Pb207 valley was greater than 5,000.
PRECISION AND PROBLEMS IN MEASUREMENT
Reproducibility of reference sample GS/4
The Geological Survey reference sample GS/4 was analyzed repeatedly during the course of the study in order to control the quality of the measurements. The reference sample was analyzed 36 times as Pbi2, from March 15, 1962 to February 27, 1963 (table 2A.), and 18 times as PbS, from August 22, 1963 to January 16, 1964 (table 2B).
The variations in the measurement of GS/4 reference sample as observed within individual runs are less than variations observed between runs. Therefore the quality of the data is best tested in terms of variations observed between runs. The mean and the standard deviations (table 3) for 36 Pbi2 measurements were 16.27+0.034, 1.0487+0.00096, and 0.4507
+0.00049 for Pb2061Pb204, Pb2061Ph207, and Pb206I
Pb208 ratios, respectively. For the 18 PbS runs the corresponding means and standard deviations were 16.21+0.019, 1.0472+0.00066, and 0.4496±0.00052, respectively. Maximum deviations observed in each of these two sets of data are about plus or minus two standard deviations. The probability that an error this large will occur between single analyses of 2 unknowns analyzed under the same conditions is less than 1 percent.
The mean values for GSI4 (table 3) by electron bombardmeiJ.t and by thermal emission on Ta filament are in reasonably good agreement. Mean values for the sulfide runs, however, are lower than the mean values for the iodide runs for these ratios by the fol-
lowing amounts : for Pb2061Pb204 by 0.056; for Pb206I
Pb207 by 0.0015; and for Pb2061208 by 0.00118. Therefore, the two sets of analytical data presumably can be made more comparable by empirically changing one or the other set of analyses ·by these amounts.
Long-term variations in the data for GSI4 by the lead iodide method show evidence of broad cyclical
changes with time, particularly in the ratio Pb206I
Pb204 (fig. 2). As a result, variations within short periods of time are less than those over the total

period of time. The total variation in Pb200/Pb204 rat.ios during the course of this study was about 0.8 percent, but within intervals of 1 month the total variations were about 0.4 percent or less.
~1easurement errors for refere.nce sample GS/4 can be examined in terms of coefficients of variation, that is, standard deviations expressed as percent of the average values of measured atom ratios or abundances. In figure 3 such coefficients of variation are plotted against mass of the ions measured by the two analytical methods. The analytical uncertainties for ratio measurements by the thermal emission method correlate with difference in mass (fig. 3A) and evidently reflect mass-dependent fractionation in the ion source. No such correlation is observed for the Pbl:! data (fig. 3A) . Analytical uncertainties for abundance measurements by the two methods (fig. 3B) are nearly comparable. Each method shows a more or less similar decrease in measurement error with increasing

ion mass. ·This decrease we attribute primarily to corresponding differences in atom abundance-there is a general tendency for the relative error to be greatest in measuring the latest; abundant isotope, Pb204, and smallest in measuring the most abundant isotope, Pb20S.
Use of replicate analyses in checking precision of measurements
Another test of the quality of data obtained in the course of this study is provided by replicate analyses of splits of a given chemical preparation of an orelead sample. All 10 ore-lead samples analyzed by thermal emission of PbS were run in duplicate on different days, starting from the prepared Pbl2; one sample was run in triplicate. Ten sets of replicate analyses of PbS samples (table 3) have standard deviations of +0.03:!, +0.0012, and +0.0007s, for the Pb200/Pb204, Pb200/Pb207, and Pb200/Pb208 ratios, re-

spectively. By the electron bombardment method, however, only four iodides were analyzed in duplicate or triplicate. Deviations for four sets of replicate analyses of Pbi2 samples are within limits equivalent to the standard deviations for GS/4.
Effects of chemical impurities and nonrepresentative sampling on measurements
In addition to the kinds of measurement errors described above, other variations may result from chemical impurities passed on from the sample or from nonrepresentative sampling of a given mineral concentrate due to unsuspected inhomogeneities. Only a few tests have been made of the possible effects of

chemical impurities. Two pairs of samples (DSw205, and .333; DSw206 and 334) represent. analyses of iodides that were of different chemical purity. They were prepared by different chemical methods from splits of one vial of galena concentrate. The variations in their isotopic analyses are equal to or less than standard deviations for GS/4. This inconclusive evidence does not imply that variations due to chemical impurities are unlikely-more experiments are necessary to reach a valid conclusion.
Two pairs of analyses (DSw215 and 224; DSw205 and 223) represent attempts to obtain representative samples by two different sampling procedures. These pairs of iodides were prepared from different galena concentrates made from a single hand specimen by handpicking and by superpanning. Differences within pairs were measured ranging from less than 1 to about 3 times the standard deviation for GS/4. The largest differences appear to be real, at the 95-percent confidence level. These observations indicate a probability that real isotopic variations existed within the hand specimen, and they point out the need for greater attention to the problems of sampling a hand specilnen, including the need for preparing multiple samples from each specimen tested.
In our investigation of Colorado ore leads we devised three experiments to test for natural variations in a single hand specimen. Small variations were found in two of these experiments, ·and larger variations were found in the third. The first experiment was made with analyses DSw264, 265 and 266 of three samples of galena taken progressively within an interval of 0 to 2 em from a pitchblende layer in an ore specimen from the Caribou mine. The observed Pb206/Pb204 ratios decrease away from the pitchblende layer, but the magnitude of this effect is less than two standard
deviations. On the other hand, variations in P Ib206
Pb207 ratios equal four standard deviations. The latter difference is an indication of real variations, at the 99-percent confidence level. In the second experiment, a similar analytical result arose from our attempt to sample a single galena crystal, 2 X 1.5 X 1 in., from Breckenridge, Colo. Four samples of this crystal, 2 from the interior (DSw275, 273) and 2 from the outermost "skin" (DSw271, 274) show no analytically significant variation in Pb206/Pb204 ratios. However, the Pb206/Pb207 ratios from the outer skin samples are lower than those of samples from the interior of the crystal. This suggests that Pb206 was less -abundant in the latest
lead to deposit on this crystal. The difference between
the 'average of the skin samples and the average of the interior samples indicates that the variations are real,

DELEVAUX, PIERCE, AND ANfl'WE:ILEIR

C185

at the 95-percent confidence level. The third experiInent showed larger variations. Analyses of a galena core (DSw253) and of anglesite (DSw254) in concentric shells replacing galena differ in ratios of Pb206/ Pb20'1 and Pb206/Pb207 by about 6 and 12 standard deviations respectively, showing tha.t the anglesite is richer in Pb206 (by about 1.0+0.2 percent).
In a previous study made on a large galena crystal from Picher, Okla., we found variations ranging up to 11 times the comparable standard deviations for GS/4 between growth zones (Cannon, Pierce, and Delevaux, 1963; Cannon, Buck, and Pierce, 1963).
The above experiments demonstrate that significant isotopic variations may exist even in hand specimens of ores. The magnitude of such variations must be assessed before variations within a mine, district, or region can be correctly interpreted. Improvement in sampling procedures is needed to profit fully from these variations, and further profit can be realized through jmprovement in analytical techniques.
RESULTS
Measurable isotopic differences were found in samples from nearly every district sampled in the present study. These range from differences in Pb206/Pb20' ratios as large as 15 percent in 13 samples in and near the Leadville district to differences less than analytical error in 7 samples from the Montezuma district. In the latter example, the 7 samples from the vicinity of the l\{ontezuma quartz monzonite stock differed in Pb206/Pb204 ratios from the average by less than the standard deviation for GS/4. Five of these samples (DSw238, 239, 240, 241, and 243, table 1) were taken at intervals through a 2-mile traverse in a water tunnel penetrating a Tertiary stock, and two samples (DSw307 and 308) are from ore deposits located in Precambrian gneiss 2,000 and 4,000 feet, respectively, a.bove the tunnel. A statistical test of tunnel samples versus mine samples indicates that the two mean compositions are the same at the 60- to SO-percent confidence level.

Analytical results obtained in the investigation (table 1) are plotted in figure 4 (p. C186), which shows the variations in ·abm1dance of Pb206, Pb207, and P:b208, relative to Pb204, owing to additions of radiogenic lead to preexisting lead in geological sources where the ore lead originated. Curves that approximate isotopic variations observed in "ordinary" ore lead (Cannon and others, 1962) are shown for comparison.
The magnitude of the isotopic variations found in the investigation is unusually large. Perhaps the most fundamental contribution that these data provide is the demonstration that ore leads within a limited portion of a single geologic province can vary this widely in isotopic composition. Such isotopic variations imply significant differences in geologic and geochemical history. These relationships will be examined in more detail and interpretations will be attempted in subsequent reports.

ANOMALOUS METAL CONCENTRATIONS IN JASPEROID FROM HYPOGENE BARITE VEINS NEAR RABIGH, KINGDOM OF SAUDI ARABIA
By DONALD A. BROBST, Denver, Colo.
Work done in cooperation with the Ministry of Petroleum and Mineral Resources, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia

A.bstmct.-An unusual dark-brown jasperoid was found in pods in the thicker parts of barite veins in fractures of the Red Sea rift system near Rnbigh, about 150 km north of Jiddah, Saudi Arabia. The suite of trace elements in the jasperoid includes Be, Pb, Y, B, Mn, and Fe in anomalous amounts. Petrographic and spectrographic data suggest that the jasperoid is of hypogene origin. It is suggested that the area of the barite deposits be checked for further indications ·of potentially valuable hydrothermal ore deposits.

GEOLOGY

About 20 kilometers N. 50° E. of Rabighon the Red Sea coast 150 km north of Jiddah, Saudi Arabia (fig. 1), barite veins from a few centimeters to 3 meters wide fill fractures in the Red Sea rift system of Tertiary age. The geology of the area is complex: country rocks consist principally of granite, granodiorite, quartz diorite, and diorite of Precambrian·(~) age cut by dikes of andesite, rhyolite, and aplite. The barite veins are well exposed, chiefly with northerly, northwesterly, and northeasterly trends. The veins dip steeply, generally 60° or more, and the dip commonly changes or is even reversed in direction along the strike. The veins ·pinch and swell along the strike and down the dip.
Mo'st of the barite veins near Rabigh are clustered in an area of severn.l square kilometers along the base of a low range of northerly trending hills. The lower flanks of the hills are much more fractured t.han the
higher core of the range. Some of' the barite veins in
the hills extend outward beneath the sand that covers
the surrounding valleys, and isolated patches of bed-

The veins chiefly are filled with white to pink crystalline masses of barite that contain scattered crystals of chalcopyrite (com·monly altered to malachite) and galena. The thicker parts of the veins also contain pods of dark-golden-brown jasperoid with black oxides of manganese.

considered area. The

j asperoid was taken from a pod about 2 feet wide and

6 feet long in the middle of an 8-foot-wide barite vein.

The jasperoid appears to have been deposited in an

opening in the earlier baritic vein material. In hand

specimen, it is dense, fine grained, and has swarms of

tiny black specks. In thin section, the quartz grains

are about 0.3 mm across, and many are interlocking.

Many specks of brown limonite and dark oxides of

iron and manganese are disseminated throu()b"h the quartz. Local segregations of tiny particles of iron

oxide ( +0.01 mm) and chalcedonic silica that prob-

ably precipitated from a colloidal gel are interstitial

to isolated grains and groups of interlocking grains of

quartz. The grains of quartz do not appear to have

been formed from a gel but rather by direct crysta1-

lization from solution. They contain disseminated in-

clusions of iron oxide, however, that seem to have been

precipitated in colloidal form. T. G. Lovering (oral

commun. Feb. 1965) regards these features as unusual

in j asperoid. He points out that normally, quartz

derived from the crystallization of a mixed colloidal

precipitate of hydrous iron oxides and silica. is

extremely fine grained and cherty in appearance

and contains the disseminated hydrous iron oxides.

Three semiquantitative spectrographic analyses of the Arabian jasperoid are shown in table 1. Accord-
ing t? chemical criteria established by Lovering and
Hamilton (1962) for the recognition of jasperoid associated with sulfide ore, the content of iron and lead in the Arabian jasperoid respectively would be regarded as "significant" and "highly significant.~~ The copper content is at the threshold of their "hi()"hly si.gni'ficant" category. The values obtained forb the beryllium, boron, and yttrium content of the Arabian jasperoid are highly anomalous compared to the median values for these elements, in jasperoid, namely, Be, 0.2 ppm; B, 5 ppm; and Y, 4 ppm (T. G. Lovering, written commun. Feb., 1965). These elements were spectrographically detected in only rubout 60 of the 210 jasperoid samples from many localities studied by T. G. Lovering. Molybdenum and mercury were detected in the Arabian jasperoid, but not in amounts that. may be regarded as anomalous.

In many miriing districts, barite deposits':· are above

or laterally outward from mineralized centers con-

taining valuable concentrations of fluorite and base

and precious metals. Hewett (1964) has synthesized

data on the relations of manganese oxides, barite, and

fluorite to occurrences of base and precious metals,

and the paragenetic and spatial relations he has found

may apply to these barite deposits in Saudi Arabia.

In the Arabian deposits, the mineralizing solutidns

followed the fracture system closely, and the wall and

country rocks were little altered by hydrothermal

solutions. Spectographic analyses of a sample of

wallrock and one of the granodioritic country rock,

near the vein from which the jasperoid sample was

collected, are shown in table 1. The wallrock sample

is not enriched in the elements abundant in the j as-

peroid and the barite, although some silver was de-

tected. The trace-element content of the granodiorite appears normal comp~red to other reported analyses of granodiorite. The trace-element analyses of table 1 support the field observations that there was little, if any, leakage of the mineralizing solutions from the fracture system in which they moved and that, at least in this area, the vein deposits are structurally controlled.
CONCLUSIONS
The occurrence of barite veins northeast of Rabigh, Saudi Arabia, that contain an.unusual jasperoid with anomalous amounts of metallic trace elements may indicate hydrothermal activity in this general area. The veins were deposited along fractures belonging to the Red Sea rift system, which is extensive and deep rooted and offers a wide target in which to search for potential ore deposits. The area of barite veins is only a·bout 20 km inland from the Red Sea across easily accessible terrain, and further exploration for

other possible local centers of mineralization seems both practical and desirable.

A GEOCHEMICAL INVESTIGATION OF THE CARAiBA COPPER DEPOSIT, BAHIA, BRAZIL
By RICHARD W. LEWIS, JR., Rio de Janeiro, Brazil
Work done in cooperation with the Departmento NacionaZ da Produoao Mineral and the University ot Bahia (Salvador, Brazil), under the auspices of the Agency tor International Development, U.S. Department of State

Abstract.-Norite and cupriferous pyroxenite intrude closely folded Precambrian biotite-quartz-plagioclase gneiss, amphibolite, and migmatite at Caraiba. Geochemical soil analyses revealed close correlation of copper, cobalt, and nickel anomalies with the mineralized area and of cobalt and nickel values with rock types. Copper in leguminous vegetation had fair coincidence with mineralization.
The Caraiba copper deposit lies in the north-central part of the State of Bahia, Brizil, about 360 kilometers northwest of the port of Salvador and 80 km south of the Sao Francisco River (fig.l)'.
Copper at Caraiba has been known for about 100 years; this deposit has been studied off and on by both government and private groups for the past 30 years. The present owners, the Grupo Industrial Pignatar1, are continuing an extensive exploration program: while awaiting essential hydroelectric energy and water from the Sao Francisco River.
GEOLOGY
The Caraiba region liesin a belt of gneiss, migmatite, and granite of early Precambrian age which forms the eastern flank of the Brazilian shield. Medium-grained biotite-quartz-plagioclase banded or streaky gneiss containing concentrations and intercalations of amphibole-rich rock (amphibole. gneiss and amphibolite) underlies much of the Caraiba area. Along major folds, the gneiss has been converted to migmatite. The ·migmatite consists of medium- to coarse-grained biotite (or hornblende) -quartz-plagioclase gneiss which shows a veined or small-fold tex-

ture. Migmatite is cut by, or mixed with fine-grained homogeneous gneiss, granite, and small pegmatitelike veins of coarse-grained quartz and microcline. The coarse-grained gneiss, which may contain almandine garnet, makes up the older part of the migmatite. It is highly contorted and shows marked separation into mafic and nonmafic bands. The granite, or younger part of the migmatite, penetrates the coarser gneiss in northward-trending dikes and elongated bodies that are generally concordant and have sharp boundaries with the enclosing gneiss. The granite is equigranular and shows only a vague foliation, which is parallel to regional foliation.
At Caraiba the gneiss and migmatite have been intruded by an ultramafic complex that is in part localized along the crests of small anticlinal folds (fig. 1). The ultramafic complex is composed of barren norite and serpentinite, together with the cupriferous pyroxenite that constitutes the ore bodies at Caraiba. These ultramafic rocks are surrounded by a series of intermediate rocks, which are progressively more feldspathic and quartzose and less mafic away from the ultramafic masses. These intermediate rocks,
in order of increasing feldspar and quartz content, are: pyroxene granulite, garnetiferous hornblende granulite, hornblende-plagioclase-biotite amphibolite, biotitehornblende-plagioclase amphibolite, and biotite-plagioclase gneiss. The distribution of these rocks suggests that they were formed by reaction of the ultramafic rocks with the gneissic country rock at the time of
intrusion.

East of Caraiba a coarse-grained syenitic augen gneiss crops out in a series of northward-trending hills (fig. 1), which are from 50 to 200 meters higher than the surrounding plain. These rocks are considered to be orthogneiss and younger than the other· metamorphic rocks.
Throughout the area, and notably south of the Caraiba mine, dikes of diabase and gabbro crop out. They trend north to northeast and are from 2 to 10 m wide. These rocks are younger than all the other rocks of the area and have no relation to the mineralization.
Rocks of the area have been affected by strong regional metamorphism. In general they belong to the almandine-amphibolite facies and were probably formed at considerable depth, comparable to the catazone of 9-rubenmann. Around the ultramafic complex, however, rocks belonging to the granulite facies have formed.
The gneissic rocks at Caraiba are folded into steeply dipping isoclinal folds which strike approximately north. These folds appear to be part of a north-trend-
aing anticlinorium that lies on the west flank of
stable area, called the Uaua dome by F. L. Humphrey and G. 0. Allard (written commun., 1962).
Original bedding in these rocks is not discernible. Foliation and banding are nearly always parallel, trending northward and dipping at high angles either east or west.
Major faults of the area fall into a northeast, north, and northwest pattern. The northeasterly faults appear to be younger, and most are filled with quartz or diabase. Surface exploratory work at Caraiba has uncovered near-surface pockets of oxide ore concentrated in north-trending shear zones that are characterized by intense hydrother:t;nal alteration (fig. 2A).
MINERALIZATION
Primary mineralization probably formed contemporaneously with the pyroxenite and consists. of dis. seminations and irregular veinlets of chalcopyrite, bornite, and pyrrhotite in the pyroxenite. Small amounts of sulfide are concentrated in knots of mafic minerals in adjacent rocks of intermediate compositio11. Minor amounts of nickel and cobalt sulfides, sphalerite, bismuthinite, and tetrahedrite were reported to be in these rocks by Schneider (1957).
Secondary copper minerals include covellite, tenorite, chalcocite, malachite, azurite, brocanthite, and chrysocolla. Secondary mineralization reaches depths of 30 m or more and is best developed in fracture zones that cut across the ore body. The best concentration-s

of secondary sulfide minerals are found above the present ground-water table, at fracture junctions at depths of 5 to 20 m below the surface. Copper sulfates and secondary sulfides rather than copper carbonates tend to appear at depth. Both silicates and carbonates are commonly precipitated in minor amounts in wallrock as much as 5 to 10 m from the protore body, and concentrations of secondary copper minerals are found in major fracture zones as far as a 100 m from the nearest pro.tore body.
The ore reserves of the Caraiba deposit were estimated by Lino de Mello, Jr., (Mello and others, 1962) of the Departamento Nacim1al da Prodw;ao Mineral to be 3,900,000 metric tons of oxidized ore. This figure was calculated for reserves to a depth of 16 m and averaging 1.2 percent copper. About 35,400,000 metric tons of measured, indicated, and inferred sulfide ore averaging 0.9 percent copper was calculated to a depth of 60 m.
CLIMATE, SOILS, AND VEGETATION
The climate of north-central Bahia is subtropical and semiarid. Rainfall ranges from 200 to 700 mill imeters per year, most of which falls between December and April. Rains are usually torrential, and runoff is as much as 80 percent. Low relief, shallow soil cover, and low permeability of underlying rocks impede the circulation of ground water, permitting a high accumulation of salts.
The soils at Caraiba are slightly alkaline and mostly residual, reflecting the underlying rock in their texture and composition. Soils developed from rocks composed mainly of quartz and feldspar (gneiss and granite) are sandy clays and sandy clay loams that are usually thin (from 30 to 40 centimeters thick). They vary from pale orange to light gray. Soils formed from rocks of intermediate composition are brown to brownish-gray clayey to sandy clay loams. Soils developed from the mafic and ultramafic rocks are desert or alk~line clays and clay loams (gumbos). These rocks are dark gray, black, or dark chestnut brown; range from 60 to 120 em in depth; are very sticky and plastic; show a prismatic structure; and characteristically develop gaping cracks upon drying. Nonresidual, alluvial soils are found only close to stream courses. They consist of silty to coarse-grained, buff to yellow-brown sands.
Seven types of soils were recognized on the basis of color and texture. They were extensively used for defining geologic contacts because of the sparsity of outcrops. The validity of this procedure is confirmed

C194

EICON10MFO GEOLOGY

by the close correlation of the cobalt, copper, and nickel content with soil type.
Low trees, spiny hushes, and cacti are the typical vegetation of the semiarid "sertao" region of northeastern Brazil. Plants are typically xerophytic and show special adaptations to the sporadic rains and prolonged dry periods. These plants have urticarial or spiny leaves as protection against foraging animals, composite leaves with reduced surface area, tubers for water storage, leaf droppage during the dry periods, and modification of stem and leaves into fleshy tissue. Low brushy or succulent plants predominate, and trees seldom grow more than 4:.m high except along stream courses, ·because of the climate and a deep and saline phreatic zone. Plants of the Cactaceae, Brumeliaceae, Euphorbiaceae, and Leguminosae families are most common. Certain plants showed a marked tendency to prefer particular soil types. Caatingueira (0aesalpina sp.) , pinhao (Jatropha curcas) , matapasto (Cassia sp.), and a small unidentified flower locally called. Saint Lucia herb (Erva de Santa Luzia) are characteristic plants of the heavy clays developed over mafic and ultramafic rocks. Calumbi (Mi·mosa aspe~0ta), cansansao (Jatropha urens), carqueja (Oalliandra sp.), coroa de frade (Melocactus bahiensis), jurema (Mimosa nigra), and xique-xique (Pilocereus gownellei) grow in sandy soils developed from siliceous rocks.
GEOCHEMICAL INVESTIGATIONS
Geochemical investigations at Caraiba were ~made of {1) soils over the ore bodies, {2) stream sediments bordering the mineralized area, (3) soils over principal rock types of the region, (4) parts of common plants of the area, and (5) caatingueira leaves in the mineralized area. The geology, including soil types, was mapped in detail, and a magnetic survey of the mineralized area was made.
Soils were sampled over the ore bodies on a rectangular grid, 2 km long from north to south and 1 km wide from east to west. East-to-west sample lines were spaced 100 m apart, and soil samples were taken at 50-m intervals along these lines. At each sample location, profile soil samples were taken at 20-cm intervals from a depth of 5 em down to altered rock or saprolitic material which was reached in most places at a depth of 80 em. The first sample interval was between 5 and 25 em, the second between ~5 and 45 em, the third between 45 and 65 em, and the fourth
between 65 and 85 em, and so on.
Stream sediments were sampled every 100 m for about 3 km along the intermittent stream that borders
the western edge of the area. Samples were taken

:from the surface to depths of 45 em in the middle of the streambed.
To obtain normal background values, soils over different regional rock types were sampled along roads for a d~stance of 20 km north and south of the deposit and 5 km to the west.
The leaves, stem wood, bark, and roots of the 12 .commonest plants of the area were sampled. Two samples of each plant part were taken, one sample in an area with less than 200 parts per million of copper and the other sample where the copper content was over 1,000 ppm.
Caatingueira leaves were sampled over the mineralized area at 100-m intervals along the grid used for soil sampling. This plant was used for systematic geobotanical sampling because of its widespread abundance, its preference for soils developed from mafic rocks, and its relatively deep root system.
To minimize contamination of samples, analytical error, and variations in the results imposed by a rustic field laboratory with no electricity or water and with constant du~t, all samples, except stream sediments, were prepared and analyzed in the geochemical laboratory of the University of Bahia in Salvador. _Rapid trace-element analytical techniques, described by Ward and others (1963), were used throughout; these visual comparison standards were employed for determination of metal content.
The range and mean average background values of six metals in soils covering the principal rock types of the Caraiba area shown in table 1 fall within the ranges expected for soils developed :from these diverse rock types (Green, 1959).
The local threshold for anomalous copper values outlining the mineralization at Caraiba was determined to be 1,000 ppm, which is 5 times the upper limit of normal regional background fluctuation and about 40 times the mean average copper value for the region. The highest copper values were in the center o{ the mineralized area over shear zones containing concentrations of secondary copper. The values range from 5,000 to 30,000 ppm (figs. 2B and 20), which are from 5 to 30 times the local threshold value and more than 200 times the regional background values. High values for cobalt range from 15 to 150 ppm (5 to 10 times regional background) and values for nickel range from 250 to 800 ppm (10 to 32 times regional background). The highest values :for nickel and cobalt were found over unmineralized ultramafic rocks in the western part of the area (figs. 2E and 2F). High values for zinc range from 20 to 50 ppm and generally correspond to areas of high copper mineralization (fig. 2G).

The dispersion pattern for copper (fig. 2B) determined from soil samples collected from 5 to 25 em below the surface shows good correlation with mineralization. Most of the known mineralized area, as deduced from copper mineralization in pits, trenches, and diamond drill holes, is enclosed by the 1,000-ppm contour line (fig. 2B). The dispersion pattern coincides with the geology only in delimiting the area of m~gmatites, which contain 'less than 100 ppm of copper, and in outlining the mineralized pyroxenites. The dispersion pattern of copper tends to shrink with depth over the mineralized areas. The isopleths for the saprolitic soil samples taken from 65 to 85 em below the surface are tight and relatively uniform around the 1,000-ppm isopleth (fig. 20). The area outlined by the 1,000-ppm isopleth does not change notably with depth and is believed to represent the actual outline of the underlying ore body.
The dispersion patterns for cobalt and nickel, determined from analytical data of soil samples collected from a depth of 5 to 25 em, show exceptionally good correlation with the geology. The patterns outline both the ultramafic complex and the halo of regional gneiss affected by the ultramafic intrusions (figs. 2E and 2F). The area with more than 50 ppm of cobalt and 100 ppm of nickel outlines the ultramafic and mafic rocks and includes the unmineralized pyroxenite and serpentinite along the west flank of the area. The dispersion pattern of cobalt tends to shrink with depth. However, the dispersion pattern for samples collected from 65 to 85 em below the surface is large and uniform, and the 30 ppm of cobalt isopleth encloses a large oval area 250 m north-south by 750 m which contains a few isolated highs of 50 ppm or more. This pattern is thought to be caused by the precipitation of cobalt on top of the less permeable
saprolitic rocks during the annual dry spells. The nickel dispersion pattern tends to spread out and be-
come erratic with depth.

The dispersion pattern for zinc is erratic and shows little relation to rock or soil types (fig. 2G). The locations of high zinc values, however, do correspond with comparable high values of copper.
The dispersion pattern for chromium follows, in general, the patterns of nickel and cobalt, but it does not have the range in values nor does it spread out at depth. The dispersion pattern for lead shows little correlation with rock type or mineralization.
The geochemical sampling of sediments in the intermittent streams on the west flank of the Caraiba deposit (fig. 2A) showed a concentration of high copper and nickel values north and downstream from the junction with the only stream that drains the mineralized area. High copper values were 50 ppm and only twice a normal background of 25 ppm of copper, and high nickel values were 40 to 80 ppm as compared with a background value of less than 5 ppm. Analyses were made of the minus 10-mesh fraction. without attempting to concentrate the heavy minerals which were scarce. This may account for the low values obtained. No significant concentration in chromium, cobalt, lead or zinc was found below the stTeam junction.
Systematic samples of caatingueira leP.ves at about 170 different sites were taken on a 100 X 100-meter grid over the Caraiba deposit. The values of copper in leaf ash ranged from 35 to 2,400 ppm. The distribution pattern for copper in the leaf ashes showed a general similarity to the pattern for copper ,in the soil (fig. 2D). Outside the mineralized area little similarity in patterns was found. Local drainage characteristics are probably the dominant factor in copper accumulation in vegetation.
Analyses of zinc and cobalt in the ashes of the caatingueira leaves showed the highest values from areas of copper mineralization. Zinc values were 300 ppm compared, to a background of 100 ppm, and co-

C196

EICON!OMrC GEOLOGY

halt showe.d high values of 40 ppm relative to a back-

ground of 10 ppm.

The pattern for lead in caatingueira leaves was

erratic and showed no correlation with the lead dis-

persion pattern in soil.

.

. Nickel was generally not present in detectable quan-

tities .in the leaf. ash.

,Preliminary results of the geobotanical sampling of

plant parts· showed that the bark of roots contains the

high~st accumulations of copper and the greatest dif-

ferences over background. The average value for

copper in ashes of root bark from the mineralized

area is 20 times the value found in unmineralized areas.

Leaves and trunk bark were found to be about equally

sensitive to an increase of copper in the soils, showing

an average increase of 10 times over background. The

woody parts of the plants were the least sensitive.

The plants that showed consistently the highest in-

creases of copper over mineralized areas were the

leguminous trees, caatingueira, calumbi, and jurema.

A preliminary geomagnetic ·Survey with a portable

magnetometer was made of the Caraiba deposit.

Measurements were made along the geochemical soil-

sampling grid. The results were not satisfactory;

magnetic highs and lows over the 'granitic and gneissic

rocks were found to be erratically distributed.

CONCLUSIONS
From the studies at Caraiba the following conclusions were reached :
(1) Geochemical copper values in soils sampled from a depth of 5 to 25 em show good correlation with subjacent geology and mineralization and obviate time-consuming deep sampling for outlining ore bodies.
(2) Cobalt and nickel values obtained from soil

samples collected from a depth of 5 to 25 em show better correlation with the known geology than they do in deep samples.
(3) High nickel and cobalt values obtained from soils that overlie the ultramafic rocks at Caraiba strongly suggest an .igneous origin for these rocks and serve to distinguish them from mafic-rich metamorphic rocks which may form similar dark gumbo soils.
(4) The very low regional background values for copper and the complete encirclement of the Caraiba deposit by a 100-ppm isopleth for copper suggest that on a regional basis, soil samples containing 100 ppm or more of copper could represent a secondary dispersion halo caused by mineralization. If so, they can be used to. outline areas of potential copper mineralization.
(5) Geochemical anomalies defined by copper values of 250 ppm or more in this region denote places definitely worthy of further investigation.
(6) Copper content of 1,000 ppm, together with nickel valu.es of 100 ppm or more, 'probably outline cupriferous pyroxenite bodies that are near the surface and indicate places that should be explored in more detail by trenching and drilling.

DISTRIBUTION OF SELECTED METALS IN THE STOCKTON DISTRICT, UTAH
By WILLIAM J. MOORE 1, G. C. CURTIN 2, R. J. ROBERTS 1, and, E. W. TOOKER 3,

Abstract.-Spectrographic analyses of bedrock and oxidized surficial materials from the Stockton district in northeastern Utah indicate a zonal distribution of metals spatially related to an intrusive center of Tertiary age. Largely coextensive areas of locally high bismuth-copper-molybdenum concentrations define a central zone; lend-zinc areas of greater lateral extent pnrtly overlnp the central zone; locally high arsenicantimony (and boron?) concentrations characterize the outer zone, with boron extending beyond the limits of significant known mineralization. Silver is erratically distributed in the areu studied. The present distribution of metals at Stockton apparently reflects hypogene environmental controls.
The Stockton district lies in the western foothills of the Oquirrh Mountains about 114 miles east of Stockton, Utah (fig. 1), and 30 miles southwest of Salt Lake City. A study of the metal distribution in surficial materials was undertaken to supplement a geologic investigation in the Bingham district, approximately 12 miles to the northeast.
.AaknowledgnMnts.-During the fieldwork at Stockton, E. H. Snyder and I. S. Droubay of the Combined Metals Reduction Co. generously made available many district maps and reports. Sahng Yup Kim of the Korean Geological Survey assisted with magnetic studies.
GENERAL GEOLOGY
The geology and ore deposits of the Stockton district have been studied by Butler and others (1920) and Gilluly {1932). The district is underlain by an interbedded ·sequence of quartzite and limestone of the Pennsylvanian and Permian Oquirrh Formation; the exposed part of tl~e Oquirrh Formation includes rocks that lie between about 4,000 and 9,000 feet above its basal contact with the Manning Canyon Shale of Mississippian and Pennsylvanian age. The limestone layers, rarely more than 50 feet thick, are medium to dark gray, arenaceous, and thin bedded. Dense, buff

to gray quartzites and cherty, calcareous sandstones separate the limestone beds. The outcrop map (fig. 1), prepared in the course of geochemical sampling, shows the distribution of the most persistent calcareous units in the area. Many of the thin limestone beds are obscured or concealed by a cover of scrub oak and quartzite slopewash.
The beds form part of the northeast limb of the northwest-plunging Ophir anticline (Gilluly, 1932, pl.I), generally strike about N. 70°-80° vV., and dip 60'0 -80° N. The beds in the northern part of the map area are: ·overturned locally and dip about 70° S. Minor drag folds are associated with some of the larger faults in the northern and central portions of the district.
Gilluly (1932, p. 88-90) recognizes several periods of faulting in the Stockton district. The earliest faults are bedding faults of minor displacement that presumably accompanied folding. These were followed by north-trending faults that dip steeply to the west and may have controlled, in part, the emplacement of quartz monzonitic intrusive rocks. Ore bodies are localized principally along the north--trending and
bedding faults. Sheared sulfides occur locally in the
underground workings, suggesting continuing postore faulting. The horizontal displacement on the faults rarely exceeds 100 feet; an exception is the Continental fault, which displa~es the beds horizontally about 1,000 feet.
Intrusive rocks ranging in composition from diorite to quartz monzonite cut the Oquirrh Formation. Most of these are dikes of quartz monzonite porphyry. The stocklike bodies shown near the southern limits of the map (fig. 1) include several small masses of quartz diorite. The igneous rocks in the vicinity of Stockton are part of an intrusive center which includes the large

stock and numerous sills exposed 2 miles to the southeast in .Soldier . Canyon.
A northwest-trending aeromagnetic anomaly, ptesumably related to intrusive rocks at depth, was found in this area (Mabey and others, 1964) (fig. 2, insert). Its presence has been confirmed by additional traverses at the surface over portions of the Stockton district, by means of a portable flux-gate magnetometer. A local magnetic high also occurs northwest of the Calumet mine over the alluviated area surrounded by stocklike intrusives (fig. 2). 'This suggests the presence of a major extension fron1 the larger, northwest-trending intrusive mass.
Limestone beds near intrusive contacts are normally bleached and recrystallized; recrystallized limestone is common within the area defined approximateiy by the 600~gamma contour line in figure 2. Small bodies of lime silicate minerals including diopside, epidote, andradite, idocrase, and wollastonite are found in this area but also occur locally in narrow zones along dikes and fissures throughout the district. The more siliceous clastic rocks in the southern portion of the district have been metamorphosed to spotted or layered hornfelses. Gilluly U932', p. 94) found that the calcareous cement in these rocks is partly repla.ced by diopside, epidote, orthoclase, and garnet.
Propylitization is the dominant type of intrusive-
';yrock alteration at Stockton (Gilluly, 1932, p. 93). eathering has obscured the effects of this process at the surface, but several dikes have a matrix composed, in part, of a soft, pale-green material, presumably chlorite. Sericitic alteration is common in gouge zones and in the plagioclase phenocrysts of the intrusive rocks.
ORE DEPOSITS
Ore deposits were first discovered in the Stockton district in 1864 and have since yielded metals valued at more than $30 million from about 1,200,000 short tons of ore (E. H. Snyder, written commun., 1965). Produc.tion values through 1927 were divided among the following metals: lead, 75 percent; silver, 16 percent; zinc, 5 percent; gold, 3 percent; and copper, 1 percent. The major properties have been owned by t.he Combined ~ietals Reduction Co. since 1924. At the present time the underground workings are inaccessible.
The major ore deposits are pipelike or blanketlike
replacement bodies that plunge steeply to the north; they are chiefly localized at the intersections of northtrending fault and breccia zones with favorable lime-
stone units. The strike length of the ore shoots seldom

exceeds 100 feet, although several have been follo\ved downplunge from the surface for more than 1,800 feet (Gilluly, 1932, p. 162). Weak mineralization was observed along some north-trending fissures cutting quartzite beds and along the brecciated margins of quartz inonzonite dikes.
Hypogene ore minerals include galena and argentite with minor amounts of sphalerite and chalcopyrite in a gangue composed of pyrite, calcite, and quartz. Oxidation of the ore bodies is practically complete to depths of 600 to 800 feet (Gilluly, 1932, p. 160). Cerussite, plumhojarosite, and anglesite are the major ore minerals in the zone of oxidation; minor amounts of cerargyrite, pyromorphite, smithsonite, hemimorphite, and malachite are also present in soine ores. Gangue minerals in the oxidized zone include quartz and hydrated iron oxides and, locally, manganese oxides, barite, and gypsum.
GEOCHEMICA'L STUDIES
About 1,000 bedrock samples were collected for semiquantitative spectrographic analysis within the areas outlined by dashed lines in figure 3A. The southern and western boundaries of the sample area approximate the outcrop limits of the Oquirrh Formation; boundaries on the north and east were selected along or near prominent drainage divides. Nearly 70 percent of the samples were taken from gossans or breccia zones that showed variable amounts of iron staining; the remainder represent "background" sample sites where no ore mineralization was visible.
The sample distribution is shown in figure 3A. No attempt was ·made to sample at regular intervals on a grid system, as the ore metals are chiefly concentrated along north-trending fissures and fractures.
All analytical work was done by G. C. Curtin, A. P. Marranzino, and Uteana Oda of the Branch of Exploration Research, U.S. Geological Survey. Each sample was analyzed for calcium, magnesium, iron, and 27 minor elements.
The distribution of locally high concentration areas for bismuth, molybdenum, copper, lead, zinc, arsenic, antimony, silver, and boron is shown in figures 3-5. Threshold concentrations were arbitrarily chosen after studying the analyses of the visibly unmineralized samples; they are greater than local background by at least a. factor of five for all elements· except bismuth and .boron. Background concentrations of bismuth and boron are less than, or similar to, the 10 parts per million lower sensitivity limit of the spectrographic method used. The directional trend of individual areas is not significant, since most areas contain

diversely oriented fissures; however, their aggregate distribution may be significant.
In the sample area north of the Calumet mine, locally high concentrations of bismuth, copper, and molybdenum are clustered in gossan samples near the Tip Top shaft (fig. 3B, 0, D); several narrow dikes have been mapped in this area (fig. 2). The first dike east of the Tip Top mine is loca1ly termed the Raddatz porphyry and, according to Gilluly (1932, p. 52), "widens considerably at depth and where cut on the 1,200-foot level of the Honorine mine is 300 feet wide."
The areas of locally high lead and zinc concentrations partly overlap the bismudf-copper-molybdenum zone and extend appreciably farther to the north and east; silver is erratically distributed in the lead-zinc zone (figs. 3-5). The highest reported arsenic and antimony concentrations occur largely in and beyond the eastern part of the lead-zinc zone. Boron concentrations equal to or greater than 50 ppm extend beyond the eastern limits of significant known mineralization but are common throughout the lead-zinc zone.
A generalized summary of the distribution of metals in the main sample area at Stockton is shown in figure 50; the overall pattern appears to reflect hypog-ene environmental controls. The areas of locally high bismuth-copper-molybdenum concentrations are inferred to have formed in relatively high temperature zones near the source of the metal-bearing solutions (Goldschmidt, 19,54, p. 483; Erickson and others, 1961, p, D317). The intermediate lead-zinc zone would indicate lower temperatures of sulfide deposition.
Arsenic and antimony are most noticeably concen-
ntrated in the eastern (lower temperature part of the
mineralized area, an occurrence consistent with the relatively high volatilities predicted for these metals in hydrothermal ore fluids (Krauskopf, 1964, p. 44). The distribution of boron may be a result of preore magmatic processes.
Each of the metals considered in the main sample area, except molybdenum, is concentrated· in the smaller area surrounding the Calumet mine (figs. 3-5).
The features of this distribution may be unrelated to
the postulated center of mineralization near the Tip
Top shaft.
The hypogene minerals which supplied certain
metals now found in the gossan samples at Stockton
are largely a matter of speculation. Galena, sphale-
rite, chalcopyrite, and argentite are likely sources for
the lead, zinc, copper, and silver; small amounts of tetrahedrite and arsenopyrite reported by Butler and
others (1920, p. 372) may account for the presence of antimony and arsenic. Hypogene tourmaline occurs

in the metamorphosed limestones of the Ophir and Mercur districts southeast of Stockton (Gilluly, 1932, p. 129), but no minerals having boron as an essential constituent were identified in the Stockton area itself. Similarly, hypogene molybdenum and bismuth minerals remain unknown; molybdenum may be present as the trace mineral molybdenite, whereas bismuth may occur as microscopic inclusions of bismuthinite or matildite in galena (Fleischer, 1955, p. 979-980).
EXPLORATION POSSIBILITIES
Geochemical studies in the areas of known mineralization at Stockton indicate a distribution of metals characterized by a central bismuth-copper-molybdenum, a medial lead-zinc, and an outer antimony-arsenic(boron?) zone. The western and southwestern portions of the district are covered by alluvium and have been only partly explored; on the basis of the zonal interpretation, further exploration is suggested in these areas. Geophysical methods and geochemical analysis may isolate target areas in the alluviumcovered limestones marginal to the intrusive center shown in .figure 2. Recent work by Erickson and Marranzino (1960, p. B98) and by Erickson and his coworkers (1964, p. 17) suggests that copper and possibly silver are concentrated in caliche coatings on clasts in alluvial sediments overlying buried ore dPposits; a reconnaissance study of caliche and soil sam·ples based on traverses extended from the bedrock control areas may be worthwhile.
Geophysical anomalies have been reported in Rush Valley, 2 miles south of Stockton (anonymous oral commun., 1965); these anomalies have been confirmed by the writers. This area lies along the projected axial zone of the Ophir anticline, the locus of ore bodies in the Ophir district·(Gilluly, 1932, pl. I), and may be a favorable area for additional geophysical and geochemical exploration.

ARIZONA-NEW MEXICO AND NEVADA-UTAH BERYLLIUM BELTS By D. R. SHAWE, Denver, Colo.

A.bstract.-Beryllium occurrences of several types in southern Arizona and New Mexico are found in a belt characterized by fluorspar deposits and beryllium- and fluorine-rich igneous rocks. The Arizona-New Mexico area is geologically similar to the Nevada-Utah belt that contains the world's largest beryllium deposits at Spor Mountain, Utah.

The purpose of this article is to compare the Arizona-New Mexico province with the Nevada-Utah belt to evaluate the likelihood that deposits of the Spor Mountain type may be found in Arizona and New Mexico.

Numerous occurrences of beryllium minerals in a.n east-northeast-trending belt in southeastern Arizona and southwestern New Mexico mark a province in which exploration may lead to the discovery of nonpegmatitic beryllium deposits of commercial value. The belt is discernible on maps published by Warner and others (1959) and Griffitts and others (1962). The belt has geologic similarities to a known beryllimn belt in east-central Nevada and west-central Utah centered at Spor Mountain, Thomas Range, Utah, which has the world's largest known beryllium deposits (Griffitts, 1964a). The Nevada-Utah belt, which also has a northeasterly trend, is discernible on the map of Griffitts and others (1962), and part of it has .been described briefly by Cohenour (1963a).
The Spor Mountain beryllium deposits are large semiconcordant tabular bodies in a thick, carbonaterich tuffaceous assemblage of sedimentary rocks, and they are closely associated with fluorspar deposits and rhyolitic rocks of unusually high fluorine and beryllium content (Staatz, 1963). Because this association seems to be genetically significant (Staatz, 1963, p. M33-35), the search for new beryllium deposits may profitably be directed to localities containing fluorspar deposits together with fluorine- and beryllium-rich rhyolitic rocks. On a larger scale, areas with beryllium deposits, fluorspar deposits, and fluorine- and beryllium-rich rhyolites may be outlined as berylliumfluorine provinces. Coats and others (1962, p. 967) suggested that areas where volcanic rocks with a high beryllium content are found in the Western United States are favorable for the occurrence of deposits of the Spor Mountain type.

DESCRIPTION OF BERYLLIUM BELTS The Arizona-New Mexico and Nevada-Utah belts and also other areas of numerous beryllium occurrences in these States are outlined in figure 1. Individual beryllium localities in east-central Nevada and west-central Utah are shown on figure 2, and those in southeastern Arizona and southwestern New Mexico are shown on figure 3; further data are in table 1. Most of these beryllium deposits are probably Tertiary in age (Cohenour, 1963a; Jahns, 1944); others are older, as at Wheeler Peak in eastern Nevada, where

their age is probably Mesozoic (Whitebread and Lee, 1961)."
Fluorite deposits shown on figures 2 and 3 tend to be larger and more numerous in the vicinity of beryllium occurrences. This same relation also is apparent in comparing figure 1 with the map showing fluorspar occurrences in the Western United States published by P ters (1958, p. 664). Probably most of these fluorite deposits are Tertiary in age, although Peters (1958, p. 667, 683-684) emphasizes recurrent mobilization of fluorine from o1der deposits in fluorine-rich regions.
Numerous silicic igneous rocks near the berylliurn belts, particularly volcanic rocks of Tertiary age, have unusually high beryllium and fluorine contents (figs. 2 and 3, and table 2). Beryllium- and fluorine-rich volcanic rocks from the Nevada-Utah and ArizonaNew Mexico belts (table 3) are similar in composition

to the average alkali rhyolite given by Nockolds (1954), but contain slightly more MgO and CaO, slightly less total Fe oxides and Na20, and appreciably less Ti02 and P205 than average alkali rhyolite. They ordinarily contain 6-20 parts per million Be and 0.12 to 0.79 percent F, yet the average rhyolitic flow rock (74-78 percent Si02) contains only 5-6 ppm Be (Shawe and Bernold, 1966, table 3) and 0.10 percent F (calculated from plate 5, B, Shawe and Bernold,
1966). The rhyolitic welded tuff in the Cenozoic Rhyolite
Canyon Formation of Enlows (1951) from Chiricahua National Monument, Ariz., is unusual in that the two samples contain 0.14 and 0.49 percent F (loc. 11, tables 2 and 3) which is much greater than the 0.05 percent F found in the average tuff with this silica content (Shawe and Bernold, 1966, pl. 5, A).

a similar contrast in the Be content, for the average tuff has 3-4 ppm Be (Shawe and Bernold, 1966, table 3), yet the one sample analyzed here has 10 ppm Be.
SUGGESTIONS FOR PROSPECTING
At Spor Mountain, Utah, the host rock of the beryllium deposits is a thick widespread unit of waterreworked rhyolitic volcanic debris, which contains numerous carbonate pebbles eroded from Paleozoic formations in the region. The unit's permeability permitted passage of a large volume of mineralizing solutions, and its chemical nature-possibly high calcium carbonate content-induced precipitation of ore minerals. Similar rocks elsewhere in the beryllium belts are worthy of exploration.
Three favorable places seem to be the Keg Mountains (east of the Thomas Range in fig. 2) in the Nevada-Utah belt, the area of the Tertiary volcanic Datil Formation of southwestern New Mexico (which is much of the northern part of the volcanics shown in New Mexico in fig. 3), and the Chiricahua area of southeastern Arizona (vicinity of rock localities 11 and 12, fig. 3). In the Keg Mountains, 5-15 miles east of the Thomas Range, tuffaceous rhyolitic sedimentary· rocks are widespread in the vicinity of fluorine- and beryllium-rich rhyolite. Volcanic sedimentary rocks are interbedded with rhyolitic rocks of the Datil Formation in southwester~ New Mexico (for example, Jahns and others, 1955, p. 94), and where they cover • ancient hills of Paleozoic carbonate rocks that provided debris to the sediments, they have much the same environment as at Spor Mountain. Sabins (1957, p. 1325, 1326) found a small quantity of tuffaceous sediments, together with fresh-water limestone and Paleozoic carbonate cobbles in andesitic conglomerate, in the Chiricahua area in the vicinity of the Rhyolite Canyon Formation of Enlows (1951), and these also may be favorable sites for mineralization.

RECENT FAULTING AT PROPOSED DAMSITES IN THE ERETAN AREA, WEST JAVA, INDONESIA By REED j. ANDERSON, La Paz, Bolivia
lVork done in cooperation with the IndQnesian Geological Survey

Abstract.-Two proposed damsites in the foothills of West Java were investigated in 1963 as part of the preliminary study f.or a large reservoir project intended to provide irrigation storage and flood control.
'l'he damsites are underlain by Miocene shale, marl, and sandstone and Pleistocene volcanic breccia and tuff. The sedimentary rocks are soft and weak and have been badly deformed by compressive tectonic forces. The volcanic rocks are relatively undisturbed, but at both damsites they are cut by faults believed to be active, and they are highly susceptible to weathering. Evidence of active faulting includes extremely young topography, little modified by erosion; earthquake activity, shown by instrumental records ·and the reports of local inhabitants ; and the chronic problem of landslides in the area. Work on the reservoir project has been suspended because of these conditions.
The northern coastal plain near the Tjimanuk River 1 in 'Vest Java is a chronic problem area because of heavy flooding during each rainy season and severe drought during each dry season. In 1962 the Irrigation Department, an agency of the Indonesian Ministry of Public Works and Power, began preliminary investigations of potential damsites on the Tjimanuk River with the hope of providing about 1 billion cubic meters of storage to irrigate 90,000 hectares (about 350 square miles) of riceland and to reduce destructive flooding in the coastal plain.
In early 1963 the Geological Survey of Indonesia (GSI) was requested to make a geologic feasibility study of damsites in the Eretan area. At that time the author was working with the GSI as an advisor in
1 ~rhe prefix "Tji" in the local language of West Java means flowl'ng water and is applied to all streams regardless of size. Translating to English is difficult and will not be attempted except for those streams that should clearly be designated as rivers. The current Indonesian practice in English-language reports, which the author follows, is to use the full name followed by the English noun ; thus, Tjimanuk River.

engineering geology, as part of the technical-assistance

program of the U.S. Agency for International Devel-

opment. The study, which was made with the assist-

ance of Ir. Rudiman of the GSI's Engineering Geol-

ogy-Hydrology Branch, resulted in detailed informa-

tion concerning foundation areas of the damsites and

a geologic map at a scale of 1 :5,000. Detailed studies

and mapping were confined to the area surrounding

the damsites ; a reconnaissance study on a regional

basis was necessary to interpret the geology, but

regional geologic mapping and the defining of strati-

graphic units were beyond· the scope of the study.

The investigation included 2 alternate potential

damsites located about 7 and 81f2 kilometers, respec-

tively, north of the town of Darmaradja, near the

village of Eretan (fig. 1). In this report they will be

referred to as damsite A, the downstream site, and

damsite B, the upstream site. Between the two sites

are a diversion dam, control structure, and tunnel that

are being used to generate electric power at Para-

kankondang. The damsite area can be reached from

'Vado or Kadipaten by a road that is sometimes acces-

sible only to 4-wheel-drive vehicles.

northeast and discharges into the Java Sea about 60 km northwest of Tjirebon. Its largest tributary, the Tjilutung River, joins it on the northern coastal plain near Torno. The river's course, which cuts across northwest-trending structures, shows little structural control except locally.
The headwater area is a high volcanic plateau 800 to 900 m above sea level which is surrounded and partly divided by volcanoes that rise prominently to heights of 2,200 to more than 2,800 m. To the north, between Baluburlimbangan and Wado, another relatively flat plateau lies at an altitude of about 550 m. It is surrounded by volcanoes that rise abruptly to altitudes of 1,000 to 1,800 m. Farther downstream the land surface drops off steeply to the broad Darmaradja topographic basin, which is surrounded by low, gently sloping hills. North of this shallow basin is a narrow belt of greater relief and steeper topography in which the damsites are located. Still farther downstream are the lowest foothills of northern Java, an area o:f low relief and gently sloping topography, and north and northeast of Torno the northern coastal plain slopes gradually to the Java Sea.

PHYSIOGRAPHY
The Tjimanuk River is one of the major rivers of West Java. It heads about 1,500 meters above sea level on the north slope of Mt. Puntjak Gede, just north of the southern mountains of West Java and about 20 km southwest of Garut. It flows generally

REGIONAL GEOLOGY
Bemmelen (1949, p. 27, 28) divides West Java into four structural and physiographic ·belts. From south to north these are (fig. 1): the southern mountains of West Java, the Bandung zone, the Bogor zone, and the coastal plain o:f Batavia (Djakarta). The southern mountains and the coastal plain are not important :for this discussion, but the structural :features o:f the Bandung and Bogor zones are important in understanding the geology of the region around Eretan. The Bandung zone, represents the top and northern flank o:f the geanticline of Java, which, according to Bemmelen (1949, p. 27, 645), has broken down along a longitudinal fault system and slid northward, compressing the Bogor zone into a complex anticlinorium of strongly folded Tertiary strata. The regional trend of roeks in this anticlinorium is difficult to determine because of the complexity o:f secondary :folding, but according to H. D. Tjia, S. Asikin, and T. L. Gan (written and oral commun., 1963) its axis passes through the mouth of the Tjinambo River just south of damsite B and strikes N. 75°-80° W (fig. 2). The secondary :folds are a distinct series o:f anticlines and synclines; anticlinal or homoclinal ridges are separated by synclinal or homoclinal valleys. Most o:f the ridges along the east side o:f the Darmaradj a basin that are underlain by sedimentary rocks are structural ridges.

Rocks of the region are cut by a series of parallel thrust and reverse faults that are probably associated with the northward sliding of the Bandung zone. Bemmelen (1949, p. 651) . describes a thrust fault that can be traced from the west foot of Tj areme volcano northwestward for a distance of about 70 km. Tjareme

and Tampomas volcanoes are most likely located on a major fault zone that passes just north of the damsites. Some geologists believe this fault zone is still active; it may be related to recent earthquake activity in the region and to the other more local faults discussed in another section of this report. Other less extensive

ANDE'R.SON

thrust or reverse faults are near the damsites and in the proposed reservoir area. Those which were found in the mapped area-near the mouth of the Tjinambo River, on the south side of Krisik Hill, and near the channel of the Tj ibodas-are shown on figure 2.
There are also two major tear faults nearby. One has offset structures south of the mapped area and seems to have offset a marl layer near damsite B. It seems to follow the Tjimanuk River channel to or beyond Eretan. The second one is outside the limits of .figure 2.
Sedimentary rocks of Miocene and Pliocene age and volcanic rocks of Pleistocene and Recent age are exposed i.n the damsite region. The most widespread types are Quaternary breccias and tuffs that have accumulated from eruptions of the volcanoes Tjareme, Tampomas, and Tjakrabuwana; these rocks overlie a thick sequence of Miocene and Pliocene shale,
marl, sandstone, and conglomerate that contains a few
limestone lenses and intercalations of tuff and breccia. The sedimentary rocks are exposed in the core and south limb of an anticlinorium, and some are repeated in the north limb. They occupy a belt extending from 'Vado to Torno (fig. 1); the outcrop pattern of each rock unit parallels the regional structural trend, which is slightly north of west. Exposed at the foot of the volcanic plateau southeast of Wado are the Tjidadap (Ludwig, 1933, p. 13-15) or Upper Halang beds 3 (Haar, 1934, p. 16-19); they are underlain to the north by the Lower Halang beds (Haar, 1934, p. 16-19) and the Pemali beds (Haar, 1934, p. 10-12). North of the damsites, thrust faulting has interrupted tl~e sequence on the north limb of the anticlinorium, and the northern facies of the Tjidadap beds and the I(aliwangu beds (Ludwig, 1933, p. 18, 19) and the Tjiherang beds (Bemmelen, 1949, p. 651-653) are exposed. The rocks u11its are tabulated in table 1. A detailed description of the geology is given in another report, in preparation by the author, on engineeringgeology investigations of the damsites.

The volcanic rocks are composed of a thick basal layer of breccia which forms the steeper part of the gorge immediately adjacent to the river, and of an overlying sequence of intercalated tuff, tuff-breccia, and breccia which forms the more gently sloping parts

of the canyon walls. The breccia is composed of an-

desite fragments, mostly in the size range of 1 to 15

centimeters, cemented together in a matrix of tuff; it

is commonly moderately well indurated. Two distinct

tuff layers are present, both of which are soft, poorly

sufficient rock :fragments to be called tuff-breccia.

These rocks are red to light yellow brown or white

and are fine to mediurn· grained ; some appear to be

quite permeable. There are also at least two separate

layers of breccia. Their difference is very noticeable

in the lower west slope of Krisik Hill, where they

have been brought together by faulting. One has a

sandy matrix and weathers gray or brown; the other

has a finer grained matrix and weathers red or light

yellow.

The Pemali beds are in the core and flank of an

anticlinorium. Their gross structure is shown in the

generalized section on figure 2; however, on a local

scale they are tightly folded and intricately faulted.

There is no apparent preferred orientation of these

local structures, although most of them seem to be

related to regional tectonic movements that formed

the Bandung and Bogor zones. In both areas where

the1Pemali beds are exposed (north and south of Krisik Hill) there are numerous tight folds; some of these

folds are overturned, and some are accompanied local-

ly by thrust faults. Most of the faults have displace-

ments of less than 1m to perhaps 3 or 4 m. The minor

folds and faults are not shown on figure 2.

In contrast to the Pemali beds, the overlying vol-

canic rocks are not :folded and are horizontal or, local-

ly, are slightly tilted as a result of faulting.

In addition to the faults mentioned previously, both

damsites are cut by :faults that are apparently not of

regional extent. A small fault follows the channel of

tli~ Tjihideung, apparently cuts the northwest side

of Banen Hill, and continues through the saddle

between Sampora Hill and Nini Hill, the location of

a proposed auxiliary dam. Overburden covers the

fault where it crosses the Tjimanuk River, but a short

distance downstream there is a localized tilting of

tuffaceous layers that indicates relative downward

movement of the northwest block. A breccia layer is

also higher in Banen Hill (alt 280m) than its pre-

sumed correlative layer in Nini Hill (217m) or in

Pakajuan Hill (less than 220m). There is also evi-

dence of :faulting in the channel of the Tjidjatigede.

This evidence is difficult to evaluate because of poor

exposures and the extreme deformation of the Pemali

beds, but it is of particular interest because local in-

habitants reported that earthquake activity in 1960

was centered in the channel. The fault follows the channel of' the Tjidjatigede, where it apparently joins the fault in the Tjibodas, and continues down the Tjimanuk River channel through damsite A.
A fault cuts through the east abutment of damsite B about 175m from· the river channel. It trends northwest and is expressed topographically by three saddles, including the one between Sampora Hill and Nini Hill. Where it crosses the river it has offset a sandstone bed on· the east bank. On the west side of the river it is expressed by a steep, narrow ravine that marks a sharp contact between red soil and graybrown soil. A branch of this :fault also offsets the sandstone bed in the river channel and extends westward to an area where landslides have been a chronic problem in the past.
EVIDENCE OF RECENT FAULTING
A :first view of the damsite area creates a strong impression that the topography is very young. Banen Hill appears to have been chopped off on two sides. It is a high, steep, pyramid-shaped knob that has been modified very little by erosion. The west wall of the Tjilombang also gives the impression of being a recent fault scarp. The slope, which is 200m high, is bare of the usual vegetation, and landslides and slumps have occurred recently.
It seems reasonable to assume that the landslides have been triggered by· earthquake activity related to faults. Landslides at the downstream end of the Parakankondang power tunnel, which involves the movement of some rock, have made it necessary to realine the tunnel, and operating personnel of the power station believe the tunnel subsequently has been affected by earth movement that has decreased the efficiency of the plant. This movement is probably also related to fault activity.
Local inhabitants of Eretan and nearby villages reported that earthquake activity has shaken the area frequently in the past few years, causing a large number of people to leave the area. Specifically, they mentioned earthquakes which resulted in the :formation of low scarps along the Tjibodas in 1956, along the
Tjihideung and the Tjisaladah on two separate o6-
casions in 1958, and along the Tjidjatigede in 1960. The information supplied by local inhabitants is
supported by earthquake data published by the Meteorological and Geophysical Institute in Djakarta. During the years 1954-59, for which complete earthquake data are available, 21 recorded earthquakes originated in the lower Tjimanuk Rivet basin very close to the damsites. During the latter half of 1955, the most active period, 13 earthquakes originated in

DETERMINATION OF MICROQUANTITIES OF MERCURY IN SULFIDE ORES BY PENFIELD TUBE-DITHIZONE AND SEMIQUANTITATIVE SPECTROGRAPHIC METHODS
By JOSEPH I. DINNIN and HELEN W. WORTHING, Washington, D.C.

A.bstraot.-Microquantities of mercury can be determined by either of two methods described. In the chemical method, mercury is volatilized in a Penfield tube, and the separated mercury dissolved and determined colorimetrically with dithizone. In the semiquantitative spectrographic method, mercury is volatilized using a deep electrode crater and a short exposure time. Both methods are applied to the analysis of mixtures of cinnabar and sphalerite.
The use of mercury-halo methods as a guide to the location of sulfide ore deposits (Saukov, 1946; Williston, 1964) has led to increased interest in the geochemistry of mercury and has fostered a need for better methods for the determination of trace amounts of mercury in sulfide minerals. Although a number of methods are available for the determination of mercury in geologic materials the methods are primarily designed for the analysis of rocks and soils and are not directly applicable to the analysis of sulfide minerals.
Sulfide minerals are likely to contain relatively high concentrations of elements such as copper and silver which interfere in the colorimetric dithizone method for the determination of mercury. Zinc and lead, although not very troublesome in moderate concentrations, require special treatment when present as major components of a mineral; trace elements such as gold, platinum, and palladium are more likely to be present in significant quantities. Although there are a number of methods available for the chemical and physical separation of mercury or for masking of interferences, the methods, albeit effective, are more involved than desirable when applied to the separation of microgram amounts of mercury from milligram or gram amounts of other compounds.
Acknowledgment. -Paul Barton, U.S. Geological Survey, furnished a large supply of mercury-free sphalerite for use in this investigation and guided and

helped in the manufacture of the solid solutions of mercury in sphalerite.
PENFIELD TUBE-DITHIZONE DETERMINATION
Chemical treatments for dissolving large samples of sulfide minerals and for the isolation of mercury or the masking of interferences require the use of relatively large amounts of reagents, each of which may be a source of mercury contamination. Elimination of the danger from reagent contamination makes attractive the various distillation procedures which take advantage of the volatility of mercury and its compounds. Although usually used for the volatilization of large amounts of mercury (Fahey, 1937), distillation procedures have also been applied to the determination of small amounts of it.
In the chemical procedure proposed here mercury is volatilized by heating the sample in a Penfield tube. A sample is heated to 800°C or higher, to assure the volatilization of any mercury compound that might be present. Mercuric sulfide . rapidly diffuses into the adjacent cooler portion of the tube and condenses on the wall. Sulfides of most other metals are relatively nonvolatile, and only insignificant quantities will accompany ·the mercury. Removal of the bulb containing the remaining sample provides a means of separating almost all the known interferences from the mer~ury in the tube. The tube then serves as a convenient container for the dissolution of the sublimed mercuric sulfide.
Although the use of a Penfield tube was arrived at independently, the technique has since been found to have been developed by Aydin'yan (1960) and used for the determination of mercury in soils (Vasilevskaya and Shcherbakov, 1963) and coal (Aydin'yan, 1961), in each instance using lead peroxide as a flux. The method is in some respects similar to the campsite

method described by Ward and Bailey (1961) in which a sample is heated with ammonium iodide in a test tube, unreacted sample spilled out, and the condensed sublimate used for the colorimetric determination of mercury.
The colorimetric 1nethod used in the present study for fhe determination of mercury is based upon the work of FriedebeFg (1955) and Yamamura (1960) ~~nd take advantage of the use of EDTA for the elimination of interferences and the presence of acetate for the stabilization of the color.
Reagents
Aqua regia: 3 parts concentrated hydrochloric acid and 1 part concentrated nitric acid (v/v).
Dilute nitric acid: 0.01N Hydroxylamine hydrochloride solution: 10 percent (w/v). Mi:x:ed reagent: Dissolve 18.6 g of disodium ethylene-diamin-
etracetnte dihydrate (EDTA) and 95 g of chloracetic acid in 600 ml of water and sufficient concentrated ammonium hydroxide to attnin a final pH of 7. Filter and dilute to 1 liter with water. Dithizone stock· solution: 0.01 percent in carbon tetrachloride (w/v). DJthizone rengent solution : 0.0005 percent in carbon tetrachloride (w/v). Prepare by dilution of the stock solution. Stock mercury solution, 1 mg per ml: Dissolve 135.4 mg mercm·ic chloride in 100 ml 1N sulfuric acid. Mercury standnrd solution, 10 p.g per ml: Dilute 2.0 ml of the mercury stock solution to 200 ml with 1N sulfuric acid.
Procedure
"\:Vith the aid of a thistle tube or long-stemmed funnel, quantitatively transfer to the bulb of a Penfield tube a weighed portion of sample estimated to contain no more tlutn 5 p.g of mercury. Cover the open end of the tube with a capillary stopper and place the tube in a jacket filled with crushed ice. I-Ieat the bulb to approximately 700°C with a gas-fired burner equipped with a heat-localizing chimney. Rotate the tube occasionally while heating for approximately 8 minutes. Remove the burner and heat the bulb to approximately 800-900°C with a gas-oxygen torch and maintain the temperature, rotating the tube continuously, for approximately 2 minutes. Seal off the bulb end of the tube and remove the bulb.
Add 1 ml of aqua regia and insert the tube, closed end down, into a bath of warm water. Gradually heat the water to near boiling and maintain at approximately 90°C for 10 minutes. In increments, add 0.01N nitric acid to the tube, mixing the solution after each addition. Place the tube in a bath of cold water until the temperature is lowered to 20-30°0. With the aid of a fine stream of water quantitatively transfer the contents of the tube to a 30-ml beaker. Add 1 ml of hydroxylamine hydrochloride solution, and stir.

After 10 minutes add 5 ml of mixed reagent and adjust the pH of the solution to 2.7-+- .1 with NH40H, using a pH meter.
Using a minimum of water, quantitatively transfer the solution to a 60-ml separatory funnel. Add 5.00 ml of the dithizone reagent solution and shake vigorously for 1 minute. After the phases have separated completely, transfer a portion of the lower layer of the solution to a clear, dry 10-mm spectrophotometer cell. Measure the absorbance of the solution at 510 millimicrons aOo 'ainst a reagent blank similarly .extracted. Compute the mercury content by comparing the absorbance of the solution with the absorbance of standard solutions of mercury similarly extracted.
Test of chemical proced1ure
Particles of cinnabar ranging in weight from 44 to 223 rnoO' were weiOo 'hed on a microbalance, transferred to respective Penfield tubes, and the mercury evolved by the technique described under "procedure." Aliquots of each diluted aqua regia solution were taken, and the mercury in each was determined by dithizone extraction and compared to the absorbance of aliquots of a standard solution of mercury. Over 95 percent of the mercury was recovered in each instance.
In the absence of samples of sphalerite or other sulfide minerals of known mercury content, mixtures of cinnabar and sphalerite were prepared to serve as standard samples. Three 50-g samples were prepared so as to contain as much as 40 parts per million of mercury. Each sample was ground in an automatic mortar and pestle for 11;2 hours, and then n1ixed on a mixing cloth. Ten-gram splits were individually ground for half an hour and recombined by mixing on a mixing cloth. Portions of each sample were, over a period of several weeks, analyzed for mercury by the described procedure. The results are given in table 1. The average coefficient of variation is approximately 3.5 percent.
Because a. m.ixture of cinnabar and sphalerite is probably not representative of the physical form of the ingredients as they exist in natural materials, an attempt was made to duplicate the natural state of the mineral assemblage. Three 10-g mixtures of sphalerite and cinnabar were prepared, containing respectively, 15.3, 35.4, and 113 ppm of mercury. The mixtures were heated in evacuated sealed quartz tubes
in a furnace at 800'0 0 for 2 weeks. Under these con-
ditions the gaseous mercuric sulfide was expected to diffuse into the lattice of the sphalerite and, upon cooling, to form a solid solution of the two. minerals. After cooling to room temperature, the melts were removed from the tubes, and portions of the .finely

Application of the chemical method
The Penfield tube-dithizone method has been applied to the determination of microquantities of mercury in sphalerite, galena, limestone, barite, and native silver. The experimental results found in the application of the method to a series of synthetic samples of sphalerite suggest that the method is reliable for the determination of mercury in sulfide minerals and may have a wider application to the determination of mercury in many geologic materials which upon ignition do not evolve large amounts of water or other volatile constituents that may physically or chemically interfere with the recovery of mercury.

ground mixtures were analyzed for mercury by the Penfield tube-dithizone technique. No significant differences were found in the mercury recovered from the samples befor~ and after heat treatment.
Use of fluxes
The use of fluxes has been found to be unnecessary for the quantitative distillation of mercury from sphalerite. Although fusion with sodium carbonate has been advocated for the quantitative removal of mercury from many materials, the technique apparently applies only to large quantities of mercury. When sphalerite containing 1 to 5 p.g of mercury is fused with sodium carbonate in a Penfield tube, only 40 to 60 percent of the mercury is recovered. Fusion with sodium peroxide yields a recovery of only 60 to 70 percent of the mercury. Lead peroxide reacts violently with sphalerite even at low temperature, and much of the reaction mixture is usually carried into the neck of the Penfield tube.
In the presence of significant amounts of pyrite it is necessary to use lead tetroxide or lead monoxide as a flux to prevent the distillation of free sulfur into the cooled portion of the tube (F. S. Grimaldi, oral commun., 1965).
Temperature and duration of heating
The temperature and duration of heating were varied over a wide range, but no significant differences were found in the amount of mercury recovered by increase in ignition temperature or longer duration of heating. Maintaining a temperature of 600-700°0 for 5 minutes is adequate for the quantitative recovery of ~ercury from 300 mg of sample. A total of 10 minutes and a higher temperature are specified in the procedure to provide a margin of safety in the distillation of mercury from large portions of sample.

SPECTROGRAPHIC DETERMINATION
The chemical method is ordinarily used for the analysis of samples previously known to contain significant concentrations of mercury. The detectable concentrations of mercury are usually found by routine spectrographic analysis of the sampies. In some instances, the spectrographic determination alone is requested on samples, and difficulty is experienced if the usual methods are used for the preparation of electrodes and exposures of the photographie plate.
The ease of volatility of mercury and its compounds presents a problem in mercury determination by spectrographic methods. In an arc, sudden excitation of a sample vaporizes mercury rapidly, and the brief duration of the volatilization results in an incomplete recording of mercury concentration due to the lag in photographic-plate response. To overcome this difficulty, a spectrographic procedure suggested by J. D. Fletcher (Fryklund and Fletcher, 1956) was tested. It was reasoned that a deeper electrode crater than previously ·used would promote a slower release of mercury into the arc stream, gradually enough to permit the emitted energy from the volatilized mercury to be recorded on the photographic plate. A short exposure time, sufficient for the vaporization of mercury, produces a spectrum almost free of continuum and free of emission from less volatile elements.
Procedure
A 21-foot Wadsworth-mount grating spectrograph, with a 5 A per millimeter dispersion in the first order, was used for the analyses. Approximately 5 ppm of mercury can be detected in sphalerite when such an instrument is used with the following conditions :

AN IMPROVED METHOD FOR RECOVERY OF BROMOFORM USED IN MINERAL SEPARATIONS
By WILLIAM M. TURNER, Beltsville, Md.

A.bstraot.-A continuous flow of fresh water circulates through a recovery bottle of simple design to separate solvent from bromoform-rich washings. Two groups of experiments show that the process may increase the recovery of bromoform, as compared with recovery by conventional methods, and that it obtains the same degree of purity. In addition, this new method eliminates the manual operations involved in the conventional methods. The method has also been found· to be suitable for the recovery of methylene iodide.
An improved method of recovering heavy liquids from wash solutions wa·s developed during studies of heavy minerals separated from a large number of sandstone samples from the Oriskany Group. Although 10 percent or less of the total heavy liquid used in any mineral separation is treated by solvent washing, loss can be great when many samples are processed. It was recognized that recovery of bromoform from bromoform-solvent washings by the conventional method-repeatedly adding water to the bromoformsolvent solution in a large bottle, shaking the bottle, and decanting water and solvent-was the least efficient step in the heavy-mineral separations. Thus a new method, which utilizes a continuous flow of water through a recovery bottle, was developed.
The conventionatmethod and variations of it (Twenhofel and Tyler, 1941, p. 81; Milner, 1940, p. 52; Krumbein and Pettijohn, 1938, p. 322) depend upon the fact that solvent and water are more soluble than solvent and bromoform. Although the principle is sound, the technique has several shortcomings. Among these are (1) the lengthy manual operations required for agitating and emptying the bottle to recover the bromoform, and (2) the loss of bromoform resulting from its incomplete separation from the solvent solution, its being carried away in the water, and its evaporation.
The new method, here termed the continuous-flow bromoform-recovery process, differs from conventional

separation methods in ~hat water is never mixed w~th or passed through the impure solvent-bromoform m~x­
ture, but instead circulates above it. The process v1r-
tually eliminates manual operations and the loss of bromoform by evaporation, and it appreciably reduces loss of bromoform left in solution in the solvent and loss by mechanical transport by the moving water.
This paper describes the continuous-flow apparatus and two groups of experiments that were made to test its efficiency.
THE CONTINUOUS-FLOW BROMOFORM-RECOVERY APPARATUS
Description
The continuous-flow bromoform-recovery apparatus consists of a wide-mouth large-volume glass bottle with a.glass stem, or drain, attached as near as possi?le .to its base and with a four-hole rubber stopper 1n 1ts mouth, through which pass a long-stemmed glass funnel and three glass tubes (fig. 1) .
Drain A is used to draw off the bromoform; the flow is controlled by a pinch clamp on a bromoformresistant rubber tube that is attached to the stem. Tube B, an air-bleeding valve, is equipped with a stopcock and terminates immediately inside the bottle. Tube 0, with attached rubber hose, is the fresh-water inlet; it, also, terminates immedi~tely inside the bottle. Funnel D, the inlet for the washings, terminates about 3 inches above the bottom of the bottle. Tube E, the water-solvent drain, terminates about 4 inches above the bottom of the bottle and has a rubber hose, about equal to the length of the funnel stem, attached to its outer end.
Operation
The empty bottle is filled with tap water through the fresh-water inlet, with the air-bleeding valve open. When the bottle has been filled as far as its neck, the

relatively low density,2 the water-solvent solution rises in the bottle while the bromoform and the remainder of the solvent, which have a higher density, settle to the bottom. With tap water being introduced at the top, the water and solvent in the bottle are displaced downward and escape through the drain tube. As the water and solvent circulate above the bromoform-rich layer in the bottom of the bottle, solvent continually leaves the bromoform and is carried away in the moving water, and purified bromoform accumulates in the bottom of the bottle.
After the addition of washings, the water flow into the bottle is reduced to a trickle and left at this rate for several hours (as, for example, overnight). Afterward the bromoform is drawn off through the bromoform drain and is ready for immediate use.

stopcock is closed so that water begins to issue from the hose attached to the water-solvent drain tube.
Bromoform-solvent washings are introduced into the water-filled bottle through the funnel. The funnel should be fitted with a piece of filter paper to insure that the washings are clear as they enter the bottle, thus eliminating later filtering. As the wash solution emerges from the base of the funnel stem, a large porJ tion of the solvent separates immediately from the bromoform and dissolves in the water.1 Because of its
1 Both acetone and methanol are soluble in all proportions in water. Bromoform is relatively insoluble, losing only about 0.319 grams in 100 em of water at 3o•c. (Handbook of Chemistry and Physics, p. 538, 586, 687.)

EFFICIENCY OF THE METHOD
The efficiency of the continuous-flow recovery method was tested by comparison with the conventional method in two sets of experiments.
Experiment 1.-In the first experiment, heavy minerals of 105 samples were separated in bromoform. The light-mineral fractions from a first group of samples were thoroughly cleansed with solvent (acetone), the washings collected, and bromoform recovered from the washings in conventional fashion. The light fractions from a second group of samples were cleansed with acetone, and the bromoform from these washings was recovered in the continuous-flow recovery bottle. A third group of bromoform separates was washed with methanol and recovered by the continuous-flow method. The results are presented in table 1.
Table 1 shows that the volume of bromoform recovered from the washings by the continuous-flow method is 20 to 35 percent greater than that recovered by conventional means. It also appears that the use of methanol instead of acetone as a solvent may increase the efficiency of the continuous-flow method by as much as 10 percent. The bromoform recovered by this process is of sufficient purity and specific gravity to be reused immediately or to be blended with the stored reserve.
Experiment ~.-To investigate further the relative efficiency of the two methods in terms of percentage of bromoform recovered from solvent-bromoform wash solutions, a second experiment consisting of a statistical comparison of these two methods was carried out by analysis-of-variance techniques (Eisenhart, 1947, p. 15;
2 Density of acetone (CH3COCH3 ) = 0.792 g per ml, at 20°C. Den-
sity of methanol (CH30H) = 0.796 g per ml, at 2o•c. Density of bromoform (CHBr8 ) = 2.84-2.98 g per ml, at 2o•c.

a Average specific gravity was controlled by immersing glass cubes of known spe-

cific gravity in a beaker filled with purified bromoform.

The experimental design is a two-way classification (methods and solvents) in which three replicate determinations of different solvent-bromoform proportions (4:1, 1:1, 1 :4) were assigned within each methodsolvent class. The order in which the replicate determinations were made was determined from randomnumber tables. Twelve observations, in terms of percentage of bromoform (2.848+ sp gr) recovered by each method, were obtained and recorded (table 2) together with the totals for methods and solvents. Table 2 shows a recovery range of 91 to 97.7 percent by conventional methods and a range of 96 to 100 percent by the continuous-flow method.
Table 3 presents the analysis of variance for bromoform-recovery methods. The variance ratio (F) for sources of variation arising from the interaction of solvents and methods (row 3, B X A) is not significant at the 10-percent level. This indicates that any sources of variation arising from solvents and methods do not arise because of their interaction. Presumably they may arise because of inherent advantages of one
solvent over the other or of one method over the other. The variance ratio arising from solvent effects is
less than 1, which in turn is very much less than the
variance ratio at the 10-percent level with (1,8) degrees of freedom. Solvent effects, therefore, are not
significant; we conclude that one solvent is as easily

separated as the other from bromoform in the recovery process, or that bromoform is separated with equal ease from either solvent.
Sources of variation arising from method effects are not significant at the 5-percent level with (1,8) degrees of freedom. From a strict statistical point of view (in which the 5-percent level is considered 3iS the maximum limit of acceptability), the methods would not be significantly. different from one another. The F ratio for sources of variation arising from method effects is, however, significant at the 10-percent level; this significance indicates that the new method is at least equal to and probably better than the old method. It is important to note that it is not significantly worse than the old method. Since the interaction term is not significant, the sums of squares of the interaction error may be combined to give a better estimate of the error variance. The new F ratios will be 0.066 and 3.24. In this case the between-methods variance is not significant at the 10-percent level.
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
Both experiments show that the continuous-flow bromoform-recovery method is at least as efficient as the conventional methods of recovering bromoform, and may be more efficient. Further, it is easier to use and requires no time-consuming manual operations. Use of the continuous-flow recovery bottle, however, does require that sufficient quantities of bromoform be kept on hand to carry out mineral-separation experiments during the period when part of the bromoform is being recovered from the solvent.

From the analysis-of-variance of methods and solvents used in the recovery of bromoform from solution in acetone and in methanol, it is evident that bromoform can be separated as easily from one solvent as from the other. This is significant because it means that the cheaper of the two solvents (methanol) can be used with no aecrease in efficiency of operation.
Although these experiments were performed using bromoform, the continuous-flow method has also been found to be suitable for the recovery of methylene iodide.

QUANTITATIVE SPECTROCHEMICAL DETERMINATION OF MINOR ELEMENTS IN APATITE
By CLAUDE L. WARING and NANCY CONKLIN,
Washington, D.C., Denver, Colo.

Abst1·act.-A quantitative spectrochemical method for deter.mination of 29 minor elements in apatite is described in which an apatite sample, with germanium dioxde added as an internal standard and as an excitation buffer, is mixed with graphite and consumed in a d-e arc. The spectrum is recorded, densitometric determinations are made, and the concentt·ations of elements are obtained from working curves. Precision is excellent for most of the elements. The data show good agreement with chemical and spectrographic determinations made in other U.S. Geological Survey laboratories.
The minor-element content of apatite is important in the study of chemical differentiation of igneous rocks and in the study of chemical precipitation in marine waters or through biological processes. It thus becomes of interest to obtain quantitative data on many of the elements which are substituents in this mineral.
To obtain this information a method was developed to determine the percentage concentration of 29 of these minor elements when they occur above the spectral sensitivity limits. A sample of apatite, with added germanium dioxide (as an internal standard), and graphite is consumed in a direct-current arc. The spectrum is recorded, densitometric determinations are made, and the concentrations of the elements are obtained from working curves.
The method differs from the one conventionally employed in the U.S. Geological Survey laboratories for the analysis of silicate rocks (Bastron and others, 1960) in that an internal standard is used (Brode, 1939, p. 80). The same amount of germanium dioxide is added to the standards and to the samples to serve both as an internal standard and as an excitation buffer. The internal-standard procedure is an aid in compensating for variations in excitation conditions.
The spectrograph used is the Wadsworth-mount grating type, covering a wavelength range from 2,250 A

to 4,750 A. on two 25.4-centimeter plates, thus having a reciprocal linear dispersion of 5 A per millimeter.
The densitometer is capable of measuring differences in transmittance with a standard deviation of not more than 0.2 percent in the 10-90-percent transmittance range.
The lower electrode is a %-inch graphite rod llf2
inches long cut to a 0.225-inch outside diameter. The wall thickness is cut to 0.015-inch, and the cup is cut to a 0.180-inch depth, including a 120° cone.
The upper electrode is a lfs-inch rod cut to a 1lj2-inch length.
STANDARDS
To carry out the work, standards were prepared for 29 elements, using pure tricalcium phosphate as a base. Spectrochemical analysis of the tricalcium phosphate showed it to be free of the elements in table 1, within
a detectability of < 1 part per million. The elements
and their ranges were suggested by semiquantitative analysis of a representative number of apatite samples from different geologic environments.

Cium fluoride to make the standards equivalent to fluorapatites.
The emulsion calibration curves are prepared by a variation of the two-line method suggested by the American Society for Testing Materials (1964). Exposure conditions are the same as those selected to analyze samples. An apatite with iron content of 0.1 percent is used, and iron lines 3037.38 A and 3047.60 A are employed. Transmissions of the two iron lines and the germanium internal standard (2829.0 A) are taken as if they are the unknown elements sought.
Their intensity ratios are calculated using the emulsion calibration curve. Experimentation shows that
any variation of the intensity ratios greater than 0.05,
that is, 3037.38 A = 1.20+0.05 and 3047.6 A = 1.45
+0.05, is sufficient emulsion change to require a new
curve to be drawn. Two arcings are made on each
plate for the purpose of checking the emulsion calibration curve.

SPECTRAL LINES
The spectral lines shown in table 2, are selected because their intensity ratios fit the desirable part of the working curves and have the possibility of determining 29 elements on one arcing of the sample.
PROCEDURE FOR SAMPLES
A 15-milligram sample of apatite is weighed and placed in a boron carbide mortar to which 5 mg of germanium dioxide and 15 mg of graphite are added. The mixture is then thoroughly ground to a fine powder and transfe~red to the electrode cup. The electrode is tamped with a special tool which leaves a center hole for gases to escape. The sample is arced to completion (130 seconds) using 15 amperes of direct current and permitting 16 percent of the light to enter the spectrograph. Standards and reference material are arced in the same manner. The spectra are recorded on Eastman III-0 emulsion, which was calibrated previously by the two-line method.
After ptocessing the plate, densitometric determinations are made, intensity ratios are obtained, and the final results are calculated from previously drawn working curves.
PRECISION AND ACCURACY
To obtain a general idea of the precision of the method, 10 arcings of the same sample of apatite were completed, and the average concentration and standard deviations were calculated for 14 elements (table 3) . The standard deviations were found to be sufficiently low.

HYDROLOGIC CHARACTERISTICS OF THE ALLUVIAL FAN NEAR SALINAS, PUERTO RICO
By N. E. McCLYMONDS and P. E. WARD, Mineola, N.Y., Morgantown, W.Va.
Work done in cooperation with the Pue1·to Rico Water Resou1·ces Authority

Abstract.-The alluvial fan of the Rio Nigua (known locally as the Rio Salinas) is an important source of groundwater supply in the vicinity of Salinas, P. R. Study of data from wells indicates that the thickness texture of the alluvial deposits, the specific capacity of wells, and the mineralization of the ground water are related to the configuration of the bedrock surface beneath the fan ; the thickest and most permeable deposits are in valleys in the bedrock surface, and the thinnest and least permeable deposits are above the intervening ridges. Recognition of this relationship affords a basis for selecting the parts of the area with the greatest potential for the development of large ground-water supplies.

Logs and other data from water wells tapping an

greatest potential for additional wells of high yield. The alluvial fan has an area of 12 square miles, and
its surface slopes gently seaward from the base of the mountains that lie to the north (fig. 2). The sediments composing the fan were derived from an area of about 50 square miles and were transported to the fan by Rio Nigua (known locally as Rio Salinas) and its tributaries. The west boundary of the fan is less than a mile from the present course of Rio Nigua, and the east boundary is at the base of the low hills as much

day (26,000 acre-feet for the year) without apparent adverse effects. About 50 wells were in use, and their yields ranged from 300 to 3,000 gallons per minute. The fan is recharged by influent seepage from Rio Nigua and its tributaries, and from water used for the irrigation of sugarcane, which is supplied via canals and by wells. Part of the canal water is from Rio Lapa and Rio Majada, but most of it is from two lakes east of Salinas outside the area of figure 2.

underlying bedrock surface, even though the contour lines may not conform to it exactly.
The principal, and perhaps the most important, buried features indicated by the contour lines in figure 3 are two major valleys separated by a low ridge. One of the valleys lies beneath the central part of the fan and the other lies beneath the eastern part. The existence of a separating ridge is established by two well logs that recorded "hard rock" at depths of less than 100 feet. Another ridge and a minor valley seem to underlie the western part of the fan, near Salinas. The buried bedrock features of the western part are not well defined because none of the logs indicate that the wells were drilled to hard rock.
The interpretation of the presence and positions of the buried ridges and valleys is of particular hydrologic interest because the relative proportions of coarse and fine materials in the alluvium, as indicated by the drillers' logs, seem to be areally related to the

of wells. Contour interval 20 feet.

The drillers' logs were used to determine the thickness, extent, and lithology of the alluvium. The thickness of the material was especially difficult to ascertain because only a few of the logs reported "hard rock" (interpreted to be bedrock). Below depths ranging from 130 feet in the northern part of the fan to 170 feet in the southern part, only clay and tosca were reported by the drillers. The term "tosca" is used commonly by drillers in Puerto Rico to denote silty clay, weathered silty limestone, or other weruthered rock. Because much of the material reported as clay or tosca in the Salinas area is believed to represent either weathered bedrock or a zone immedi.ately above the bedrock, it was assumed that little or no permeable unconsolidated material lies below the · clay or tosca. Figure 3, which shows the altitude of the base of permeable water-bearing sediments, probably reflects rather closely the configuration of the

subsurface topography. The percentage of sand and gravel in the alluvial-fan deposits commonly decreases southward, away from the source rocks in the uplands. However, it has been found, in addition to this general trend, that sand and gravel constitute a larger proportion of the sediments within the major buried valleys than in other parts of the fan, and that locally they are in extensive beds. The alluvium penetrated in wells in the northern part of the central buried valley was reported to contain as much as 70 percent sand and gravel, whereas the alluvium over the small southoostward-trending ridge west of that valley contains 30 to 40 percent sand and gravel.
The significance of this pattern of abundance of sand and gravel deposits, with respect to water supply, lies in the areal distribution of values of specific capacity (fig. 4). The specific capacity of a well, its yield in gallons per minute per foot of water-level drawdown, is related directly to the transmissibility

of the water-bearing sediments tapped by the well. Because transmissibility is a function of both the thickness and texture of the water-bearing sediments, and because these characteristics of the alluvial fan seem to be related to the configuration of the bedrock surface, the areas in which wells have higher specific capacities may be expected to overlie the principal bedrock valleys, and the areas in which wells have lower specific capacities to overlie bedrock ridges. (These conclusions are based on the assumption, believed to be reasonable, that the wells are of comparable efficiency, so that their specific capacities can be compared.) Figure 4 shows two areas in which wells have specific capacities exceeding 125 gallons per minute per foot. The eastern of these areas overlies the eastern buried valley (compare figures 3 and 4), and the western area overlies the axis and the west side of the central buried valley.
Differences in the total dissolved-solids content of the ground water, as indicated in figure 5 by lines of equal specific conductance, also seem to be related to the configurations of the bedrock surface. A plausible explanation for this relationship is that the ground water in the deeper sediments (those restricted to the buried valleys) tends to be more mineralized than the ground water in the shallower sediments (those coextensive with the fan). Thus wells tapping the full thickness of the alluvium in the bedrock-valley areas yield a blend of both the more and the less mineralized water, whereas wells tapping the alluvium overlying the bedrock ridges yield only the less mineralized water. Quite possibly the water in the deeper sediments has percolated farther and has been in storage longer than that in the shallower sediments and thus has had more opportunity to dissolve minerals from the sediments with which it has come into contact. Furthermore, the water in the shallower sediments is more subject to dilution (or freshening) by water infiltrating from the land surface. The diluting effect of seepage from Rio Nigua is particularly noticeable in that the least mineralized ground water in the fan is near the river. Seepage from precipitation and seepage from the irrigation-water distribution system also dilute the shallower ground water. The specific conductance of the water in the Rio Nigua commonly is between 400 and 500 micromhos, depending on the flow; that of the irrigation water, most of which is derived from Lago Carite and Lago Patillas (both several miles east of the fan) , generally is less than 150 micromhos. The high specific conductance of the ground water in the extreme southeastern part of the fan probably reflects the locally high alkalinity of the

Recognition of the relation of the availability and chemical quality of the ground water to configuration of the bedrock provided the basis for delineation of areas (fig. 6) in which large yields from wells can be expected and in which development of the groundwater resources currently is negligible. If future high-

yield wells are concentrated in these areas, fuller development of the water in the alluvial fan can be realized with minimum detrimental effect on existing well installations. Increased use of the ground water will result in salvage of water that otherwise would be discharged through evapotranspiration or by outflow into the sea.

RELATIONSHIPS OF FRESH AND SALTY GROUND WATER IN THE NORTHERN ATLANTIC COASTAL PLAIN OF THE UNITED STATES
By JOSEPH E. UPSON, Washington, D.C.

A. bstmct.-Mapping of the boundaries between fresh and salty wnter in selected aquifers in the northern Atlantic coastal plain of the United States reveals that the limit of salty water and the configuration of the present coastline conespond closely only in the late Pleistocene and Recent deposits. In successively older aquifers the correspondence is progressively less. Here th''e salt-water boundaries are believed to be controlled chiefly by the circulation patterns of the fresh water in the aquifers, notably the locations of dischnrge zones. Also, in Maryland and Delaware large lenses of fresh wnter that might represent Oligocene and Pliocene episodes of terrestrial conditions are lacking. Thus, hyd~·odynnmic adjustment of the boundaries has been rapid enough to lceep pace with the general relative changes of sea level since Cretaceous ·and Eocene times.

limits are determined by the flow pattern of the fresh ground water.
In this paper salty water is taken to be that having 250 parts per million or more of Cl ion. Within large areas in the older formations the salinities of the salty water are low, a few hundred to about a thousand parts per million of Cl ion, suggesting that the zones of transition between fresh water and water with salinity near that of sea water (about 18,000 parts per million of Cl ion) are very broad. Also, even though

Sea-water contamination of fresh ground water by encroachment into coastal aquifers is an ever-present fear of users and distributors of potable water in coastal areas. Along the Atlantic coastal plain, with its hundreds of square n1iles of low-lying areas underlain by unconsolidated water-bearing sediments, there are many instances of contamination or threatened contamination of a good water supply; and there are one or two instances where contamination has been expected but has not taken place. In some aquifers, salty water occurs many 1niles from the sea, and at some localities near the shore a deep well penetrates alternating bodies of fresh and salty ground water. These differences and seeming anomalies are thought to stem from differences in the circulation pattern of fresh ground water in the different aquifers, controlled at least in part by the principal intake and discharge areas for each aquifer. Proximity to the present shoreline is a controlling factor only in the shallowest aquifers.
This paper deals with the. coastal plain in Long Island, New York, New Jersey, Delaware, and Maryland (fig. 1). The purpose is to describe the occur-
rence of "salty" ground water and to show that its

the water does have more than ordinary concentrations of chloride, much of it contains predominant sodium bicarbonate and hence is not of typical sea-water composition. Nevertheless, there is no other reasonable source for chlorides, and consequently water having 250 ppm or more of Cl ion is considered to originate either from the present sea, or from the sea of an earlier geologic time.
GEO·LOGIC FORMATIONS AND AQUIFERS
The coastal-plain sediments range in age from Cretaceous to Pleistocene and, in the area considered, contain representatives of all the intervening epochs except the Oligocene and perhaps the Pliocene. The formations into which these sediments are divided contain aquifers which yield the water pumped for use. Salty water is knmvn to occur somewhere in the seaward parts of most of the aquifers, only some of which are discussed here. Those discussed are shown in table 1

together with their approximate age and a general statement of their mode of origin.
BOUNDARIES OF THE SALTY WATER
The approximate locations of the boundaries between fresh and salty ground water for certain of these coastal-plain aquifers in Long Island, N.Y., New Jersey, Delaware, and Maryland (fig. 5), their distribution pattern, and other data suggest that the saltwater boundaries are a reflection of, and are dependent upon, the circulation of the fresh water in the different aquifers. This idea is inherent in theoretical considerations of fresh-water-salt-water relationships as described recently and fully by Henry (1964), wherein the shape and position of a theoretical fresh-salt-water interface is shown to be determined primarily by what Henry ( 19~4, p. C59) calls the discharge parameter of the containing deposits. This parameter takes into consideration the permeability and thickness of the

aquifer, and its discharge, which in turn is related to the hydraulic head. This concept has not been applied to field relationships on a large scale.
That the circulation pattern of the fresh water, rather than the density of the salt water, might control the position of the fresh-water-salt-water interface first occurred to the writer several years ago while 1naking a study of the predevelopment conditions of alty ground-water occurrence on the New Jersey coast. This study showed that at a number of places there is more than one salt-water body in the vertical section.
The occurrence of salty ground water beneath the New Jersey barrier beach from Sandy Hook to Cape May is shown on figure 2. The upper of the two sections contains a plot of old wells, drilled before 1900, for which either initial hydraulic head or presence of salty water, or both, are recorded.1

The lines of heavy dots on figure 2 represent, to the south, the approximate initial head in the lower aquifer of the ICirkwood Formation (Miocene), the so-called Atlantic City 800-foot sand; and, to the north, in the Wenonah, Mount Laurel, and Englishtown Formations (Cretaceous) which comprise, or are in hydraulic continuity with, the so-called 550-foot sand at Asbury Park.
The initial head along most of the shore in the J{irkwood Formation had an altitude of about 25 feet, but to the north the head declined, suggesting a discharge zone in the vicinity of Berkeley. The initial head in the Wenonah, Mount Laurel, and Englishtown was about 50 feet above mean sea level. There was also a discharge area to the north, but these data do not show it. These features were recognized 35 years ago by David G. Thompson (1928, 1930).
The occurrence of salty water suggests the presence of two bodies of salty ground water: a shallow one in

water moves generally parallel to the , bedding, past the salt water, along the flow surface toward discharge points to the north and south. This would certainly be true where the aquifer is overlain by tight confining beds or where the head is about the same as in overlying aquifers. In shallower aquifers or in others overlain by incompletely confining beds, some water discharges by upward leakage wherever the hydraulic gradient is favorable. In that case, there is a strong cross-bed component to the flow lines. Water is still moving along the interface, but in a vertical rather than horizontal sense. This is surely the case with much of the Magothy ( ~ ) of Long Island, and probably with some of the younger aquifers farther south.
REGIONAL PATTERN'S OF TH E SALT- WATER BOUNDARIES
The approximate location of the salt-water boundaries in several formations is shown on figure 5. They are based upon quality-of-water data; upon maps of individual aquifers such as the Manokin (fig. 3); and, for the speculative offshore positions, upon the general parallelism of the boundaries and the piezometric contours.
The boundary in the Cretaceous (Magothy Formation in Maryland and Delaware, and Raritan in New Jersey) is placed about midway between the boundary

in the older Cretaceous sediments as drawn by William Back (written commun., 1961) and that in the upper Eocene (Piney Point) as drawn here. The line is controlled by only a few points, except in western Long Island, where there are many. The boundary for the lower Kirkwood aquifer is extended from Gill's (1962) mapping across the tip of Cape May County, N.J. , parallel to the initial piezometric contours as restored. There has been a huge drop in head along the whole coast from At lantic City, N.J., southward, so the boundary now may be somewhat closer to the shore. The boundary in the Englishtown Formation is drawn farther seaward than in the Kirkwood because the initial head in the aquifer was higher. In this region, too, a large cone of depression created by pumping near Asbury Park, N.J., and to the south probably has caused some landward shift of the interface from its
initial position. As shown on figure 5, the salt-water boundaries in
successively younger formations lie successively farther seaward in Maryland and Delaware and are more and more nearly coincident with the shape of the presentday Delaware-Maryland peninsula. The boundary in the Pleistocene deposits lies along the present shore in an irregular pattern. In New Jersey and on Long Island the boundaries are independent of the present

shoreline except in the Pleistocene deposits, in which the boundary roughly corresponds to the lagoons.
As thus approximated and restored, the patterns of the salt-water boundaries seem to reflect the main zones of localized discharge from the aquifers. This is shown most noticeably by the boundaries in the Choptank-IGrkwood aquifers of Delaware and southern New Jersey, and in the Englishtown-Magothy( ?) aquifers of northern New Jersey and Long Island. The Choptank Formation is roughly the equivalent of the
IGrkwood (W. C. Rasmussen, written commun., June
26, 1963). The water-bearing zone may be the equiv-
alent of either of the Kirkwood aquifers. Flanking

Del~ware Bay, the boundary in the Choptank curves inland toward the north, and that in the Kirkwood curves in from the east, the two seemingly headed for a meeting beneath the central part of the bay. The Delaware River probably had a Pleistocene channel comparable to the Pleistocene channel of the Susquehana (Hack, 1957, fig. 6). In the channel the base of a Pleistocene fill probably cuts the Choptank-Kirkwood aquifers in about mid-bay, and thus makes a good outlet for discharge there.
Similarly the outer part of New York H~rbor is
bordered by the Englishtown Formation in New J er-
sey, and its approximate equivalent, the middle part

of the Magothy ( ?) Formation. of Long Island. The salt-water boundaries in these units extend northwestward and westward, respectively, seemingly headed for a juncture beneath the outer part of New York Harbor. In, and off the mouth of, the harbor, the aquifers come in contact with overlying Pleistocene deposits. These deposits are known to be permeable in the vicinity of Jamaica Bay, N.Y., and they doubtless transmit water in the area beneath New York Harbor.
Data on the Raritan are available for only about half of the New York Harbor area. In New Jersey the salt-water boundary of the Raritan suggests discharge into New York harbor. There is probably a somewhat similar boundary off Long Island, but, for the Lloyd Sand Member of the Raritan Formation, which is the Raritan aquifer on the New York side, there are few data on either the piezometric level or the water salinity. On the other hand, figure 2 shows that the Englishtown and Raritan come close together beneath Sandy Hook, N.J. The two formations are truncated by Pleistocene or Recent deposits beneath New Yotk Harbor at nearly the same place, and the respective outlets for fresh-water discharge must be near each other.
In Maryland, the boundaries in the Piney Point Formation (upper Eocene) and in the Choptank (Miocene) parallel the general pattern of the piezometric contours. The contours suggest discharge to streams leading into Chesapeake Bay or into the marshland bordering the Bay. The extreme southwestern part of the boundary in the Choptank is not closely controlled, but is approximately as drawn. That it does not extend farther north along Chesapeake Bay to the area of outcrop of the formation along the Choptank River may be because of upward leakage of fresh water into the Choptank aquifer from the deeper lying Piney Point.
The boundary in the Piney Point lies farther seaward near Chesapeake Bay than does that in the Choptank. The rather sharp bend in the trace of the boundary at the edge of the Bay is thought to point toward a discharge zone lying somewhat farther north. Extending a little west and north from this sharp bend is a narrow area in the marshland along the east side of Chesapeake Bay where several wells have more-than-ordinary concentrations of chloride. This
area may separate two discharge zones of the Piney Point-one from the east, and one from the west.
The broad bend in the boundary of the salty water
in the Raritan and Magothy aquifers between southern New Jersey and eastern Maryland probably reflects
the discharge of fresh water in the upper part of Del-
aware Bay. In general, however, there are so few data

controlling the position of the boundary in these formations that it cannot at present be correlated with discharge zones any more closely.
The last boundary to be discussed is that in the Pleistocene deposits. The location is not very well controlled in detail, but it must be at least approximately as shown. It coincides closely with the present shore alinement, as it should, because the salt water was emplaced during the rise in sea level that accompanied the retreat and waning of the Wisconsin glacial ice. It occurs generally not far landward of the barrier beach. The details of its distribution are probably also controlled by the pattern of ground-water movement, as in the deeper aquifers, but the detailed pattern is too intricate to be delineated by the data available. This shallowest salt-water body is generally overlain by a thin surficial lens of fresh water.
Beneath the barrier beach, the presence of the saltwater body seems to depend chiefly on the absence of confining beds of Sangamon age. These are clays and silts of the Pamlico Formation in Maryland and Delaware, the Cape May Formation in New Jersey, and the Gardiners Clay on Long Island. Where these confining beds are present, the salty water mainly lies above them. Where absent, the salty water extends deep in the section-from about sea level down through the Pleistocene deposits, and at places into the Miocene formations. For example, on Long Island fresh water occurs nearly everywhere beneath the Gardiners Clay, with salty water above. In Ne~ Jersey, most of the Cape May Formation is permeable, and, at least in the southern half of the coast, salty water extends down into the Cohansey nearly everywhere. However, in a reach in southern Cape May County, N.J., certain estuarine clay beds have fresh water beneath them.
The pattern of boundaries suggests that the flow pattern in general and the location of the discharge zones in particular control the position of the saltwater boundaries. This conclusion leads to the inference that the· boundaries are in at least approximate equilibrium with the fresh water.
This inference is strengthened by the relationship of the boundaries to one another in the regions between the discharge zones irr the estuaries, such as in the Delaware-Maryland peninsula. Here, in vertical
section, the boundaries in the successively older aqui-
fers are both deeper and farther landward. In a general
way they lie along a single smooth curve, concave
landward, without marked irregularities. The geo-
logic sequence traversed by this curve contains at
least two major episodes of continental conditions
with the predominantly marine sequence, one in the
Oligocene and one in the Pliocene. Were the bound-

aries markedly out of equilibrium one might expect to find within the salty water large lenses of fresh water representing these terrestrial episodes of the geologic history:' This seems not to be the case. Whether or not the boundaries are in precise equilibrium depends on the relative head of fresh and of salty water.
HYDRAULIC-HEAD RELATIONSHIPS
Theoretically, equilibrium between fresh water and sea ·water in a coastal region requires that the hydraulic head of the fresh water be at least high enough to balance the head of salt water in the vicinity, considering the difference in density, a~d assuming that in the aquifers, at some seaward point, water of sea-water density fills the interstices from the sea floor down throughout the aquifer concerned. Let us take the density of sea water at Atlantic City, N.J., as being representative of open-coast sea water along the Atlantic coast. At Atlantic City the water has a mean specific gravity of approximately 1.023 (U.S. Coast and Geodetic Survey, 1957), corresponding to a salinity of 31,500 ppm or to a chloride concentration of about 17,400 ppm. This mea:ns that for every 100 feet of depth below sea level, the fresh water must have a head of 2.3 feet or more above sea level, or else the sea water will move landward.
At some localities the fresh-water head before being disturbed by withdrawals· was equal to, or more than enough to balance, the head of sea water at the depth at which the fresh water is observed. For example, in the Kirkwoo.d~·.··aquifer at Atlantic City (fig. 2) the initial hea~ .~of fresh water at depths around 800 feet was about' 25 feet above sea level; using the figures in the previoi1s paragraph, 18.4 feet would be about enough theoretically to balance the head of sea water. Similarly;' ~or the Englishtown Formation at Asbury Park, N.•J. {fig. 2), the initial head of the fresh water was nearly· 50 feet at depths of 700-800 feet, whereas at that depth, about 17 feet of head would have been enough.,_.· The present head at these localities, after several decades of withdrawals, is of course much lo\Yer than was the initial head.
Along the south shore of Long Island, N.Y., the fresh-water head is now, and perhaps was initially, too low to maintain equilibrium with the head of sea water. Two deep wells at Jones Beach on Long Island (Perlmutter, and others 1959, p. 430) are exampies. In these wells the head has fluctuated around 8 feet above sea level since 1929 and 1933, respectively. The wells are 1,000 feet deep; and to be in approximate equilibrium the head should be at least 23 feet above sea level. There is no record of what the head at this place was before any pumping in the vicinity, but it

has remained at about its present level for a considerable time.
At some other places data are inconclusive. For example, figure 3 shows the head in the Manokin aquifer along the Atlantic shore in Maryland to be 5 feet, or less, above sea level. The top of the aquifer here is around 300 feet below sea level; hence the freshwater head should be around 7 feet above sea level. The piezometric contours are based on observations made mostly in the early 1940's or before, but no really early observations (near the beginning of withdrawals) are known. The initial head might have been somewhat higher. Similar data for the Choptank aquifer in eastern Maryland suggest that the head is a foot or so higher than necessary to balance salt water at the depth of the aquifer. Thus, although not precise, the data suggest that, except for the Long Island locality, the fresh-water bodies are nearly or quite in equilibrium with the nearby sea.
CONCLUSIONS
The analysis presented in this paper indicates that the circulation pattern of the fresh ground water in general and the location of the discharge zones in particular control the locations of salt-water boundaries in coastal regions. In the parts of the aquifers that are overlain by confining beds, as between the major drowned river valleys or estuaries of the northern Atlantic coastal plain, the salty water is deeper or farther seaward in the aquifers that have a higher head. In such areas the fresh-water movement is extremely slow; it may be largely an imperceptible upward leakage, perhaps in part a slow drift laterally toward the main discharge points. In these regions, then, the salt-water boundaries are probably practically horizontal, and ·because the movement of the fresh water is extremely slow, it has been possible for the zones of transition to become thick vertically, and hence apparently broad horizontally. The means for developing the thick transition zones is in part the .dispersion mechanism, mainly resulting from tidal fluctuations, identified and described by Cooper (1959), and in part the larger-scale movements accompanying the changes in sea level over geologic time.
Along the margins of th~ drowned river valleys, however, where post-Pleistocene fill in erosional channels lies against the edges of the aquifers, fresh ground water can escape much more readily, and the salt-water boundaries are near these escape zones. The movement of fresh water is more rapid and the transition zones correspondingly narrower. Here, also, differences in the head of fresh water in the different aquifers can cause local areas of overlap on the map.

The general patterns of the boundaries also suggest

that hydrodynamic adjustment of the positions of the

salt-water boundaries has been rapid enough to keep

pace, at least approximately, with the relative changes

of sea level that have taken place since the Late Cre-

taceous. Crude measurements. of fresh-water head

related to the depth of the aquifers at most places,

show either a substantially greater head than needed

to balance sea water or a head "deficient" by only a

few feet below the head required to maintain theoreti-

cal equilibrium.

·

The boundary in the Pleistocene formations is

doubtless in equilibrium, unless locally influenced by

withdrawals, because, owing to the relatively high per-

meability of the deposits, there was little resistance to

the advancement of the sea-water wedge through the

deposits as the edge of the sea moved landward in

post-vVisconsin time. Fresh water already in the un-

confined aquifers would simply be lifted up and floated

off to sea until lost by mixing.

An additional conclusion of a more practical nature

is that along the barrier beach of the northern Atlantic

coastal plain, except very near the land surface, salty

water probably occurs downward into the uppermost

confining bed. Below that, at many places, fresh water

may occur in one or more zones. Still deeper, mod-

erately saline water may be found, especially in preCohansey formation~ remote from discharge areas.

This water of moderate salinity may underlie broad

areas, and if penetrated by a well, should not neces-

sarily be taken to indicate that the aquifer is being contaminated by direct movement from the p~esent sea.

CHEMICAL EFFECTS OF IRRIGATION-RETURN WATER, NORTH PLATTE RIVER, WESTERN NEBRASKA
By G. V. GORDON, Lincoln, Nebr.

A.bstract.-'l'he return of irrigation water to the North Platte River by ground-water discharge was the main cause of a 27-percent increase in the dissolved-solids content of the river water during 1964, in a period of low fiow in the 60-mile reach between the Wyoming-Nebraska boundary and Bridgeport, Nebr. 'l'he effects of irrigation return were most pronounced in the reach of the stream in which the fiow was least. The irrigation-return water from south of the river generally was of poorer quality than that from north of the river; this difference may be due to differences in the quality of the applied irrigation water and in the nature of the soils in these two parts of the unsin.
Deterioration of the chemical quality of water in the 60-mile reach of the North Platte River between the Wyoming-Nebraska boundary and Bridgeport, Nebr., has for some years concerned local water users and State officials. Because the North Platte River provides water for the irrigation of many thousands of acres of land in western and south-central Nebraska, a continued deterioration of its water quality could eventually have an adverse effect on the economy of the area. Possible causes of the deterioration are (1) inflow of municipal-waste effiuent, (2) return flow of irrigation water to the stream by ground-water discharge, and (3) the inflow of wastes from the processing of sugar beets. The purpose of the investigation described in this paper was to determine the effects of irrigation return.
METHODS OF STUDY
Fieldwork for the investigation was done during the period August 17-20, 1964. This was considered to be a good time for the investigation because the flow of the river was being maintained almost wholly by return flow from irrigation, and because the quality of the river "rater was not being affected by the processing of sugar beets, which occurs later in the season (October-December).

Water samples for this investigation were obtained at 4 sites along the North Platte River, at 6 sites on major canals, and at 25 sites on natural or artificial drains whose flow was maintained wholly or in part by irrigation return (fig. 1). Streamflow-gaging stations were in operation, at the 4 river sites and at 16 of the sites on drains, and water discharges for times of sampling were computed from the gaging records. '\Vhere no gaging stations were in operation, discharge measurements were made at the time of sampling. '\Vater samples from many of the smaller drains were collected by D. J. Neely, hydrographer for the Nebraska Department of Water Resources.
SOURCE AND VOLUME O·F FLOW OF THE NORTH PLATTE RIVER
The North Platte River has its source in the high mountains in north-central Colorado. As it flows northward and then southeastward through Wyoming; its flow is augmented by that of the Medicine Bow, Sweetwater, and Laramie Rivers and a number of smaller streams. During this course, its flow is also regulated by a series of storage reservoirs, Seminoe Dam and Guernsey Dam being the upstream and downstream facilities, respectively. In Wyoming, the North Platte River provides water for municipal, industrial, and irrigation use and, in turn, receives wastes resulting from those uses. Ordinarily, by the time the water in this river reaches Nebraska, it already has been used extensively.
Within the reach of the river studied, no rain fell just prior to or during the period of fieldwork; moreover, precipitation had been below average earlier in the summer. It was therefore assumed that no overland runoff was entering the river during the period of investigation. All the inflow to the river was either (1) municipal-waste effluent or (2) ground water; both occurred as discharge directly into the river or

into streams and manmade drains that empty into the river.
If we assume that the average daily volume of municipal-waste effluent is 50 gallons per person, the effluent from all the municipalities in this reach (combined population in 1960, 24,315) totals only 1.9 cubic feet per second, or less than 1 percent of the total flow of 287 cfs at Bridgeport (169 cfs in the main channel and 118 cfs in the Browns Creek channel) at the time of sampling for this investigation. Furthermore, because effluent from the municipalities in this reach generally contains less than 1,000 parts per million of dissolved inorganic solids (which is only about 500 ppm more than the content in the river water at the upstream end of the reach), the effects of municipal effluent on the chemical quality of the river water must be very small indeed. Therefore, any significant change in the chemical quality of streamflow within the reach at the time of study can be attributed to the chemical quality of the ground-water inflow.
All or nearly all the ground-water inflow to the North Platte River is discharge from the zone of satu-

ration in the unconsolidated sediments that underlie the irrigated terrace lands on both sides of the river (~ enzel and others, 1946, p. 120). Although precipitation is the source of some water in the zone of saturation, seepage from irrigation constitutes a much larger part; in fact, were it not for the recharge from irrigation seepage, ground-water inflow to the river would be small, and it ordinarily would be negligible at the time of year that this study was made. F or this reason, ground-water inflow to the river in this reach may be regarded as consisting almost wholly of irrigation return, and the effect of ground-water inflow on the chemical quality of the streamflow may be attributed principally to the chemical quality of the irrigation return.
At the time of this study, the flow of the North Platte River at the State boundary was 1,160 cfs, and within the reach between the boundary and the town of Mitchell the measured inflow totaled 77 cfs. Because most of the streamflow in that reach was diverted for irrigation, the flow at Mitchell was only 156 cfs. Between Mitchell and Minatare, measured inflow to

C246

QUALITY OF WATER

the river was 126 cfs. However, diversions for irrigation in this reach were nearly as great as inflow, so that the total flow near l\1inatare was only 164 cfs (49 cfs in the main channel and 115 cfs in Ninemile channel). Measured inflow to the river between Minatare and Bridgeport totaled 310 cfs, but diversions for irrigation in this segment of the valley decreased streamflow to 287 cfs at the downstream end of the study reach. From these figures it is apparent that the flow of the North Platte River at successive downstream sites consisted of irrigation return in progressively greater proportions.

QUALITY OF IRRIGATION AND RETURN WATERS

Data in table 1 represent the chemical quality of

canal water that is used for irrigation in the area, and

data in table 2 represent the quality of water in the

North Platte River and in irrigation drains that are

tributary to the river. Each sampling site was

assigned ·a reference letter or number that serves to

identify the site in figure 1.

Three of the canals listed in table 1 divert water

directly from the North Platte River: the Interstate

Canal and the Fort Laramie Canal about 35 miles up-

stream from the Wyoming-Nebraska boundary, in

Wyoming, and the Mitchell-Gering Canal at the

boundary. The wa,ter conveyed by Horse Creek Later-

al is diverted from Horse Creek-a natural tributary

of the North Platte River draining a long narrow seg-

.ment of upland that lies east of the Laramie Range in

Wyoming. Any flow in Horse Creek below the point

of diversion, which is about 5 miles southwest of

Lyman, Nebr., is a result of irrigation return. Water

in the Interstate High Line Canal and the Govern-

ment Low Line Canal is derived from Lake Alice and

Lake Minatare, respectively. These two lakes are

supplementary storage reservoirs for water diverted

from the North Platte River into the Interstate Canal.

The water in all the canals except the Horse Creek

Lateral was of the calcium sodium sulfate type and

contained from 462 to 522 · ppm of dissolved solids.

The water in the Horse Creek Lateral was of the

sodium calcium sulfate type and contained 541 ppm

of dissolved solids. Sodium, sulfate, phosphate. and

boron concentrations in the water from the Horse

Creek Lateral were somewhat greater than those in

the water from other canals. The canal water was

very similar in chemical quality to water in the North

Platte River at the Wyoming-Nebraska boundary;

some was of slightly better quality, and some was of

slightly poorer quality.

'

Irrigation return in the area (table 2) was definitely

more mineralized and of more variable chemical char-

acter than the canal water used for irrigation (table 1). On the north side of the river the return water was generally of a calcium bicarbonate or calcium sodium bicarbonate type, and its dissolved solids ranged from 539 to 720 ppm and averaged 616 ppm. On the south side of the river the return water was generally of a sodium bicarbonate type, and its dissolved solids ranged from 597 to 867 ppm and averaged 766 ppm.
The weighted-average composition of the water from tributary drains is shown in table 3. The drainage from the south side, besides being more mineralized, contained almost twice as much boron as the drainage from the north side. In contrast, the drainage from the south contained appreciably less silica than the drainage from the north. Although concentrations of the major anions (bicarbonate, sulfate, and chloride) were greater in drainage from south of the river, their relative proportions were almost the same as those in drainage from north of the river. Both the concentrations arid the relative proportions of the major cations (calcium, magnesium, and sodium), however, were considerably different in drainage from opposite sides of the river.
One explanation for the difference in chemical quality of irrigation return from opposite sides of the river is the small, but nevertheless apparent, difference in the quality of the applied water. Chemical analyses of applied water (table 1) indicate that sodium comprised a greater part of the cationic composition of water on the south side of the river than it did on the north side. Consequently, one would expect sodium to comprise a correspondingly greater part of the cationic composition of irrigation return from the south side (table 3).
The difference in sodium percentage (percentage reacting value) in drainage from opposite sides of the river is greater than one might expect, however. If allowance were made for the irrigation water to undergo some base exchange (wherein calcium and magnesium ions originally present in the water would be exchanged for sodium ions released from the soil), thereby increasing its sodiurn concentration, the sodiurn percentage in drainage from the north side would seem to be low. Apparently, irrigation water on that side does not undergo base exchange to the extent that it does on the south side. A possible explanation may
lie in a difference in the soils on each side of the river. Soil surveys made jointly by the U.S. Department of
Agriculture and the University of Nebraska indicate
a more widespread occurrence of calcareous soils
north of the river (Hayes and others, 1920, soil map). These calcareous materials may inhibit base exchange

and thereby contribute substantially to the calcium bicarbonate character of the drainage from north of
the river. Irrigation-return water that was discharged into the
North Platte River between the State boundary and Bridgeport was of poorer quality than the river water at the boundary. The dissolved-solids content of irrigation-return water was as much as 70 percent greater, and the concentrations of bicarbonate; nitrate, phosphate, and boron were all higher than in river water at the State boundary.
The greatest change in the quality of river water occurred in the reach between the State boundary and Mitchell. The river water increased in the concentration of every constituent except iron and magnesium. Increases were substantial in the concentrations of sodium, bicarbonate, nitrate, and boron; the increase in total dissolved solids was 160 ppm. In this reach, large amounts of water were diverted into the Mitchell-Gering, Tri-State, and Enterprise Canals, and a large proportion of the inflow to the river (I:Iorse Creek and Lane drain) was significantly poorer in quality than the river water at the State boundary.
The least change in the quality of river water occurred in the reach between Mitchell and Minatare. The dissolved-solids content of river water at the sampling site near :Minatare was the same as that at Mitchell. Although most ions showed small increases in their concentrations, bicarbonate remained unchanged and sodium and sulfate decreased. The most conspicuous change was in phosphate, which increased

from 0.11 ppm at l\iitchell to 0.21 ppm near Minatare. Very probably the increase in phosphate concentration reflects the high phosphate content of the fertilizers that are used in this area.
l\1ost of the irrigation return in the reach between l\1inatare and Bridgeport was of better quality than the river water near Minatare. River water at Bridgeport showed a decrease in the concentration of dissolved solids because of decreases in the. concentrations of sodium, bicarbonate, chloride, nitrate, and boron. Calcium, potassium, and sulfate concentrations increased slightly. It seems likely that the quality of irrigation return in this reach of the river is better because a much smaller volume of water is diverted from the river for irrigation here than in the reach from the State boundary to Mitchell.
Over the entire reach of the North Platte River between the State boundary and Bridgeport, total dissolved solids increased 27 percent, sodium increased 32 percent, and bicarbonate 45 percent. Sulfate increased only 3 percent. The concentrations of phosphate and boron more than doubled, and the concentrations of silica and nitrate more than tripled. The only constituents to show consistent increases in concentration downstream were silica, calcium, and potassium. The consistent increase in calcium is reflected in the increase in hardness ; magnesirun remained nearly unchanged throughout the reach.
Increases in the concentrations of the major ions and in the concentration of boron reflect the leaching effect of irrigation water on the more soluble salts in the

soils. Increases in the concentrations of potassium, nitrate, and phosphate reflect in part the presence of these constituents in fertilizers. The effect of fertilizers on drainage water from cultivated fields is illustrated in table 4, the data for which were obtained by A. Voelcker (Robinson, 1949, p. 36) from the Broadbalk wheatfield at Rothamsted, England. The wheat~ field had been under continuous cultivation for 80 years, and after fertilizers were applieq the concentrations of silica, potassium, sulfate, nitrate, and phosphate in the drainage water increased 100 percent or more. With the exception of sulfate, these same constituents increased nearly 100 percent or more in the water of the North Platte River between the Wyoming-Nebraska State boundary and Bridgeport. The increase in the concentration of sulfate is very small (3 percent) , probably because sulfate fertilizers (chiefly ammonium sulfate) comprise only a small percentage of the total quantity of fertilizers used in this part of the North Platte Valley (Nebraska Dept. Agriculture and Econ. Devel., 1964, p. 19).

SUMMARY
The data obtained during the period August 17-20, 1964, indicate an increase of 27 percent in dissolved solids and a change in water type from calcium sodium sulfate to calcium sodium bicarbonate in the North Platte River between the Wyoming-Nebraska bounda:r;y and Bridgeport during a period of low flow. The available evidence indicates that the increase and the change were due mostly to irrigation return. During periods of medium and high flows, the percentage increase is undoubtedly much less.

WATER-QUALITY VARIATIONS IN THE CUYAHOGA RIVER AT CLEVELAND, OHIO By M. E. SCHROEDER and C. R. COLLIER, Columbus, Ohio
Work done in cooperation with 'the Ohio Department of Health

Abstraot.-The quality of water in the navigable portion of the Cuyahoga River at Cleveland, Ohio, varies with the length, depth, and width of this 5-mile reach of the stream. Near the river mouth the water is stratified during periods of low flow, when the water, which contains large volumes of industrial and municipal wastes, overlies the cooler and less mineralized water from Lake Erie. Water-quality conditions are further complicated by the irregular and unpredictable changes in water levels in the river due to seiche and wind action on Lake Erie.
Understanding of the variability of water-quality conditions throughout the length and depth of .the channel is required in order to interpret data from '\vater-quality monitoring and sampling in the navigable portion of the Cuyahoga River at Cleveland, Ohio. The navigation channel of the Cuyahoga River at Cleveland extends 5.1 miles upstream from the mouth of the river (station 500, fig. 1). The channel averages about 150 feet in width and is maintained at a minimum depth of 23 feet. Heavy indiustrial complexes line both sides of the channel, and industrial and municipal outfalls are scattered along its length. The water quality in the channel is a result of the intrusion and incomplete mixing of lake water with the river and outfall water.
Measurements of specific conductance, water temperature, and dissolved oxygen were made at various depths in the navigable channel in 2 traverses along the centerline, and in 3 cross sections, on October 2021, 1964, to determine the water quality during a period of low streamflow. To provide information on the changes in the quality of the river water during the time of the traverse, recording conductivity meters were installed at the Republic Steel Corp. water intake, 1.2 miles upstream from the head of navigation,

and at the E. I. DuPont de Nemours and Co. intake (station 722) at the turning basin, 4.2 miles upstream from the mouth. A water-quality monitor recorded conductivity, temperature, pH, and dissolved oxygen of the water at the Center Street bridge.
STREAMFLOW AND W-ATER-LEVEL FLUCTUATIONS
The average discharge of the Cuyahoga River as it entered the navigation channel was 189 cubic feet per second on October 20, 1964, and 162 cfs on October 21. Over a long period these discharges are exceeded between 80 and 90 percent of the time.· The only significant additional inflow is that contributed by the Cleveland Southerly sewage-treatment plant. Along the navigation channel, large volumes of water are withdrawn by industry, primarily for cooling, and returned to the channel. Passage of the· river water through the navigation channel is slow because the cross section of the channel is large and because seiching which occurs frequently in Lake Erie tends to obstruct the flow near the mouth of the river.
The water level of Lake Erie fluctuated continuously during the study. Lake levels shown on figure 2 were taken from the hydrograph of the lake gage (upper center, fig. 1) !n the east basin at the foot of East 9th Street, Cleveland, operated by the U.S. Army Engineer District, Lake Survey, Corps of Engineers. The hydrograph for October 20 is irregular and fluctuates over a 0.57-foot range in lake level. Part of the fluctuation is believed to have been caused by a north wind; seiching apparently caused part of the variation, although no pattern is evident. On October 21 the range in lake level was 1.50 feet, and the hydrograph is even more irregular than that for the previous day.
The fluctuation in the level of Lake Erie also affects

the water level in the navigation channel of the Cuyahoga River. At Center Street bridge (station 545), 0.86 mile upstream from the mouth, water levels below an arbitrary reference point were measured by tape during the traverses. Comparison of these measurements with the hydrograph of the lake level (fig. 2) shows that the water-level fluctuation at Center Street bridge closely resembles that of the lake. (This figure illustrates only the similarity of the fluctuations in water level at the two sites, because an arbitrary datum was used for the reference point at Center Street bridge.)
VARIATIONS IN WATER QUALITY IN THE CHANNEL
The continuous records of specific conductance at the Republic Steel intake (fig. 1), upstream from the head

of navigation, and at the DuPont intake at station 722, farther upstream, indicated no significant change in the water quality in those reaches of channel during the· traverses. The range in specific conductance at the Republic Steel Corp. intake was from 1,200 to 1,230 micromhos during the October 20 traverse and from 1,200 to 1,220 micromhos during the October 21 traverse. At the DuPont intake the conductance ranged from 1,280 to 1,300 micromhos during the October 20 traverse; on October 21 the conductance at this site was constant at 1,480 inicromhos.
At Center Street bridge, the water quality, as indicated by specific conductance at a depth of 5 feet, c_hanged continuously and erratically. During the October 20 traverse it ranged from 1,050 to 1,240

traverses were made from a boat at about midchannel,

starting at the mouth (station 500) and extending to

the head of navigation (station 770). Measurements

were made at 1,000-foot intervals along the channel,

and at each 5-foot increment of depth. At the Center

Street bridge (statjon 545), at station 717 (just down-

stream from the turning basin), and at station 722 (at

the turning basin), measurements were also taken half-

way between the center and ~ach side of the channel, to

deter1nine the cross-sectional variation in water quality.

The traverses show that the water in the upper

reaches of the channel is well mixed and of uniform

quality, whereas in the lower 2-mile reach the water

quality changes both with depth and with distance

from the mouth. The specific-conductance data for

October 21, 1965, are shown on figure 3. For clarity,

only the data for the 5-, 15-, and 25-foot depths are

shown. Upstream from the vicinity of station 640,

differences in specific conductance of the water at

various depths are small, indicating nearly complete

mixing of the river water with the industrial and

municipal wastes contributed along this reach.

Downstream from station 640, and progressively to-

ward Lake Erie, there was a continuous improvement

in the quality of the river water. The improvement

was due to the dilution and mixing of the river water_

with lake water. However, mixing was not complete,

and the quality of water in the navigable channel de-

pended significantly on depth. The general reduction

in the specific conductance of the water with depth is shown in figure 3. The colder and less mineralized lake water had intruded upriver under the warmer and more mineralized river water.
The improvement in water quality from station 640 to Lake Erie is also indicated by the temperature profiles in figure -4. Upstream from station 640 the temperature was nearly uniform, both longitudinally and at the various depths. From station 640 to the · mouth of the Cuyahoga River there was a general

reduction in temperature, with cooler water near the lake and at depths.
The higher water temperatures in the navigation channel are the result of the heat load in the water contributed by industrial and municipal waste outfalls in the Cleveland area. Thus at Independence, upstream from the reach affected by heavy waste disposal, the thermograph record showed a range in water temperatures from 55°F to 57°F, as compared with a range from 78°F to 86°F measured in the upper navigation channel.
Because of their difference in temperature the water in the navigation channel and that in Lake Erie are of different density. When the lake water moves upstream, due to seiche or to wind, it tends to move under the warmer and less dense river waters. This upstream movement of Lake Erie water in the Cuyahoga River is similar to the upstream movement of sea water into a tidal estuary. In tidal estuaries, the sea water is more mineralized and therefore denser that the fresh water, and stratification occurs as the river water passes over the sea water. The Cuyahoga River is more mineralized than Lake Erie, but because of its higher temperature the river water is less dense and tends to flow over the lake water.
The stratification of the water which was observed during this study in the downstream reach of the navigation channel of the Cuyahoga River probably persists throughout the summer months, when the temperature difference between lake water and river water is significant. During periods of high water discharge, or when the temperature differential of the lake and river is small, the stratification is probably altered or destroyed. During high-flow periods there would be little or no movement of lake water upstream into the channel, and water-quality differences throughout the channel should be small. Moreover, when the temperature differential is small, the density difference and resulting stratification should be reduced. During periods when the temperatures are similar, the river water-because it is more mineralized than hike water -may even be denser, and may pass under the lake water.
Lateral variations in water quality were also observed in the downstream reach of the Jlavigable channel. Six series of conductivity measurements at 5-foot increments of depth were obtained at the onequarter points across the channel at Cent~r Street 'bridge (station 545) . In each series of measurements, differences were noted in the specific conductance at a given depth, with the lower conductance occurring

generally at midchannel. These measurements also indicated the incomplete mixing of the river water (containing waste water from municipal and. industrial outfalls) with lake water. The discharges from the outfalls evidently tend to follow along the sides of the channel.
The passage of ships and tugs provides some mixing of the water, but does not completely destroy the vertical stratification or lateral differences in the water quality. This mixing was observed at Center Street bridge, where a cross-sectional measurement made immediately after passage of a loaded ore freighter moving upstream indicated that water in the left (west) one-third of the channel was temporarily well mixed below a depth of 10 feet. Also, the common appearance of black sludge and bottom sediments at the water surface after passage of freighters shows that the bottom water is overturned.
Cross-sectional measurements taken at station 717 and in the turning basin at station 722, where there is no vertical stratification of the water (see figs. 3 and 4), showed no lateral. variation. The conductivity measurements indicated a uniform water quality both laterally and vertically.
The dissolved-oxygen content of the water was deficient throughout the navigation channel during the study. However, a measurement above the navigation channel, at Independence, showed a dissolved-oxygen concentration of 6.4 parts per million, or 57 percent saturation. This satisfactory dissolved-oxygen concentration is due, at least in part, to aeration of the water as it passes over several riflles upstream from Independence. The oxygen was soon depleted, however, when the river received the municipal- and industrial-waste load in the Cleveland area. Measurements of dissolved oxygen there showed that all sections of the navigation channel more than about 1 mile upstream from the mouth had 0.0 ppm of dissolved oxygen. The anaerobic conditions in the chan-
nel were also shown by gas .bubbles, which were seen to rise and break at the surface in some reaches. Within about 1 mile of the mouth, the intruded lake water provided some dissolved oxygen. At Center Street bridge, the dissolved-oxygen concentration at the 5-foot depth ranged from 0.0 to 1.9 ppm on October 20, and from 0.1 to 1.2 ppm on October 21. At station !500, at the river mouth, lake water contributed considerable dissolved oxygen. The concentrations at the 5-foot depth were 2.8 ppm (30-percent saturation) on the morning of October 20, and 5.0 ppm (50-percent saturation) on the morning of October 21.

CONCLUS·IONS
The study indicated that water from Lake Erie intrudes the navigation channel of the Cuyahoga River, and that stratification of the lake and river water occurs. Seiches, wind, and probably fluctuations in streamflow and lake levels affect both the extent of the intrusion and the degree of stratification of the water. In the upstream reaches of the channel the water is

apparently well mixed, and samples representative of the cross section at a given site may be obtained at verticals near midstream, or possibly from largevolume water intakes. In the downstream reaches, where stratification occurs, sampling at several verticals in the cross section and at several depths is necessary to define water-quality conditions in a given cross section.

A HYDRAULIC SQUEEZER FOR OBTAINING INTERSTITIAL WATER FROM CONSOL.IDATED AND UNCONSOLIDATED SEDIMENTS 1
By FRANK T. MANHEIM, Woods Hole, Mass.

.Abstract.-A squeezer based on designs developed by P. A. Kriukov has been constructed, using fabricated and commercially available parts, and used with a ~tandard laboratory press to recoYer interstitial water from sediments. Analyzable amounts of water were extracted from as little as 2 g of relatively compact sediment at pressures of 3,000 to 9,000 psi (approximately 200 to 600 kg/em 2 ). Extraction of water from most samples of core materials from Recent to Paleocene sediments was completed in 3 minutes. The residue after squeezing is in the form of a compact pellet which may be further dried to determine total water content of the original sample. The present work confirms Soviet experience, with similar squeezers, that pressure does not appreciably affect the composition of extracted waters when proper precautions are observed.
With the recent rise of interest in the composition of interstitial waters of sediments, a number of methods have been employed by Western workers for extracting pore fluids for geologic study. These methods include leaching (Emery and Rittenberg, 1952; Kullenberg, 1952; Swarzenski, 1959), centrifugation (Powers, 1957; Rittenberg and others, 1963), immiscible-liquid displacement (Scholl, 1963), gas displacement (Lusczynski, 1961), low-pressure mechanical squeezing (Shepard and Moore, 1955; Siever, 1962), and low-pressure gas-mechanical squeezing (Hartmann, 1965; Raymond Siever, oral commun., 1965). Except for leaching, these methods are best suited for use with Recent sediments or other relatively unconsolidated sediments. In the Soviet Union, on the other hand, hydraulic squeezers of the Kriukov type (Kriukov, 1947; Kriukov and Komarova, 1954) have been used extensively for both unconsolidated and consolidated sediments. For example, interstitial water has been squeezed from Jurassic claystones containing 9 percent water by wet weight (Buneev and others, 1947).
Centrifugation, low-pressure squeezing, and other methods prov~d inadequate to deal with the small,

partially compacted core sections from holes drilled in the Atlantic Ocean bottom off Florida (JOIDES, 1965). A small squeezer of the Kriukov type, constructed with minor modifications, proved effective in extracting water from several hundred core samples weighing from 2 to 15 grams. To my knowledge, this type of squeezer has not been used before in the United States, and its simplicity of operation and its capability for handling even small samples of relatively compact sediments recommend it for wider usage. To this end, details of construction and operation are reported in this paper; no originality in basic design is claimed.

CONSTRUCTION
The squeezer utilizes a commercially available cylinder and ram (made by the Carver Co., Summit, N.J.) to which a machined base with a filtering element and fluid outlet is fitted. Construction details are shown in figure 1. The filter unit consists of a stainless steel screen and a perforated steel plate contained in a circular recess in the steel filter holder. Alternatively, a porous (sintered) metal plate may be used to replace both screen and perforated plate. The top surface of the filter should be flush with the outer rim of the holder so that it may support one or more paper filter disks. Fine-grained, hardened laboratory

The present design permits insertion of a disposable syringe (preferably plasLc) directly into the base of the squeezer to receive fluid. The narrow effluent hole is reamed out to permit fitting of the standard "Luer" taper of the syringe nose.

A larger squeezer has also been constructed using a 2~-inch Carver cyIinder and piston. The design is similar to that shown in figure 1, except that the filter plate is increased in thickness to give greater strength. The effluent line remains small. Because the crosssectional area of the cyIinder bore of the small squeezer is about 0.88 inch, a 10-ton laboratory press exerting its maximum load of 20,000 pounds will apply a pressure of about 22,000 pounds per square inch to the sediment. However, a 20,000-lb load will apply only about 5,000 psi in the large unit. The large ~queezer should therefore be used with a higher capactty press when more compact sediments are to be squeezed.

OPERATION

filters give a visually clear effluent, but membrane or micro filters may be used to assure maximum freedom from suspended matter. The lower part of the filtering assembly, fitted with a rubber washer, protrudes into a recess in the steel base; when pressure is applied the gasket is squeezed against the cyIinder and prevents leakage of water around the filter unit. The space in .the recess and the diameter of the outflow boring are kept small so that little fluid can collect in the squeezer itself. AU metal parts in the filter base are made of Iron and Steel Institute No. 303 stainless steel. The Carver cylind.er and ram are chrome-plated steel. If maximum corrosion resistance must be maintained, the cyIinder and ram should also be machined of a good grade of stainless steel, because the chromium will abrade in time, exposing corrodible steel. Rubber and Teflon disks just below the piston prevent loss of fluid upward when pressure is applied. The rubber, Teflon,

Figure 2 illustrates the manner in which the squeezer is operated. In sequence the steps in squeezing a sample are as follows: The filter holder with its gasket is placed in the recess of the filter base. The screen, perforated plate (or porous disk), and 2 or 3 filter-paper disks are positioned. The cylinder is seated over the filter unit so that it rests firmly on the base. Sediment is then quickly transferred into the cylinder through the top, followed by the Teflon and rubber disks. The Teflon and rubber disks can be placed above the sample in either order to obtain a leak-free pressure transfer, but placing the Teflon disk below the rubber disk gives a cleaner seal than the reverse order shown in figure 1. The piston is depressed as far as it will go into t.he cylinder, and the whole unit put in the press for squeezing. Pressure is applied gradually at first, and when the first drop of interstitial fluid is seen the syringe is seated in its hole in the base (effluent passage in figure 1) . The squeezed-out liquid moves the plunger of the syringe back as the liquid is expelled, and there is minimum opportunity for evaporation. When the desired amount of liquid has been obtained the syringe is removed and capped.
.Measurement of the amount of extracted interstitial water may be made (1) by weighing, or (2) volumetrically, with an accurately calibrated syringe. The preferred method in the present work has been to weigh the syringe on a single-pan semimicro balance having a precision of 0.1 milligram. After the syringe is emptied of the liquid the syringe is capped and

accuracy is sufficient, conversion of weights to in vacuo units need not be carried out.
After extraction of the liquid the parts of the apparatus are rinsed with distilled water and (except for rubber parts) with acetone. The acetone helps dry the unit quickly in preparation for the next sample. The squeezing and washing operations together can be completed in 5 to 10 minutes.

weighed again to determine the amount of liquid. For 1 milliliter of sample the weighing precision is approximately +0.01 percent (relative), whereas for 0.1 ml the precision is +0.1 percent. Weighing has the following advantages: (1) temperature corrections for volumetric apparatus are eliminated, (2) the measuring precision for small amounts
of fluid is better than can be achieved by volumetric
methods, and (3) the proper units for weight-weight

determinations are obtained without specific gravity
measurements. Experience has shown that evaporation
losses, probably the largest potential cause of error in
this procedure, can be held to 0.1 percent, which is con-
sistent with routine rapid operation. If this level of

DISCUSSION
Sampling
Samples which were taken immediately after the recovery of the core or sediments and were placed in airtigh~ containers may be stored for some time if proper precautions are observed. Good results have been obtained when moistened lruboratory tissue was wrapped in polyvinyl chloride film (kitchen-type plastic wrap) and placed above the sediment in glass sample vials with tightly fitting plastic closures. The film helps take up condensation space in the vials, and the moist tissue hinders evaporation from the sediment. When kept chilled (not frozen) such samples can be kept several months without appreciable evaporation. Sampling technique must, of course, be based on the individual problem and on the elements for which analysis is desired. Experience has shown that even relatively permeable cores can yield uncontaminated fluid if the outer parts of the cores are discarded in sampling. Lusczynski (1961) used fluorescein dye in drilling fluid so that contamination of cores could be mere readily detected.
Determination of total water content
Frequently it is desirable to determine the total water content of samples from which interstitial water is extracted. After squeezing by the present procedure practically all of the sediment remains as a firm to hard, flattened disk ; loss of sediment by smearing on cylinder walls and other surfaces is usually low (less than 1 percent). The original water content may be determined by finding the difference between the weight of the sediment before squeezing and the weight of the compressed disk, plus any scrapings, after <?ven drying at 110°-120°C. To minimize exposure of the sediment to evaporation, the first weighing should be done with the sample container closed, and the container and cover should be reweighed after removal of the sediment to be squeezed. The squeezed and dried pellet is available for further studies.
Influence of srqueezing pressure
Soil scientists have long appreciated that squeezing pressure may influence the composition of pore solu-

tions extracted from sediment. Northrup (1918) pointed out that pressure may affect liquid-solid equilibria within the sediment in a variety of ways, and that it may cause solution or precipitation effects. Recent studies have suggested that, above a few thousand pounds per square inch, molecular (salt) filtration may take place when liquids are squeezed through clay membranes (for example, see Von Engelhardt and Gaida, 1963) .
Detailed studies by Kriukov and his coworkers (Kriukov and l{omarova, 19~6; Tsyba and Kriukov, 1959; and l{riukov, 1964) have shown, however, that in normal practice the composition of water extracted by the present type of apparatus is not appreciably influenced by squeezing pressure until adsorbed or selni~. liquid layers poor in electrolytes begin to be squeezed· from the sediments at high pressures. An ex"ample' of
athe variation in composition of extracts froin. sodium
bentonite clay subjected to successively higher squeezing pressures is given in figure 3. The pressure at which the drop in chloride occurred in extracts from the sample (at about 50 to 60 percent of water removed, fig. 3) is given by l{riukov and l{omarova (1956) as about 600 kilograms per square centimeter ·or about 8,500 psi. The corresponding thresholq for chloride in 0.86N NaCl was about 1,400 kg/cm2 or 20,000 psi (also in sodium bentonite), whereas for fresher waters the influence of pressure on composition was noted at lower pressures. Sodium bentonite is especially sensitive to pressure effects, in part because of its large capacity for adsorbing water. Studies cited in Kriu-
kov and Zhuchkova (1963) indicate that the pressure
threshold for influence on the composition of intersti-
tial water is shifted to higher pressures for ordinary
sediments. The results of the above work may be

applied to the present squeezer, because it differs from Kriukov's apparatus only in details of construction and in the technique for withdrawal of eftluent, but not in operating principle.
In the interests of accuracy and speed, pressure should be applied gradually at first, and the pellet thickness should be kept small with respect to the diameter. Samples of 2 to 15 grams having from 20 to 60 percent bulk water were squeezed in approximately 3 minutes each. When samples of sediment of such size that the thickness of the compacted pellet is greater
than % to Ys of the diameter are squeezed rapidly,
dense sediment layers may be formed next to the filter paper while t~e opposite end of the sample remains moist. Such behavior slows recovery and may, under some conditions, give rise to irregular compositional effects on the extracted fluid.
In any event, it is desirable to sque:::!.ze sediments, representing the range of materials to be studied, at different pressures, and to analyze the extracts. The chloride concentrations of successive extracts from two widely different sediment types are shown in table 1. Sample 1, from the F1or1da-hatteras slope (U.S. Atlantic coast) , contained a large proportion of finely divided carbonate. Sample 2, from the Gulf of Maine, contained more than 50 percent clay minerals, chiefly illite and mixed-layer montmorillonitic clays. The slightly lower chlorinity of the initial aliquot from sample 1 may be due to condensation, in the exit tube, of moist air initially pressed out of the sample chamber. This would result in slight dilution of the initial water fractions. Sample 2 is an average of replicate squeezings from two clayey mud samples which had
been homogenized by kneading in a bag of kitchen-
type plastic wrap. No further water could be obtained

even on raising squeezing pressure to 21,000 psi. The last samples squeezed have a slightly higher chloride content than earlier ones. However, membrane-salinometer (Sanders and others, in press) determinations on the residual cake suggest that the remaining water has a lower chlorinity than the analyzed aliquots. This would be in accordance with Kriukov's finding of electrolyte-poor, "adsorbed" water in the last waters squeezed out of sediments. Replicate determinations of Cl on homogenized muds do not usually differ by
more than 0.04 %0 , part of which may be. due to in-
homogeneity in the mud and part to analytical error.
Limita·tions and applications
The present method is not applicable to crystalline rocks, nor to sediments too dense to be formed into a flat cylinder under available pressure. In order to avoid squeezing out electrolyte-poor adsorbed water .from sediments, "safe" squeezing pressure limits should be 'determined experimentally for sediments typical of the range of materials to .be studied. This is particularly applicable to sediments having very dilute pore waters. Coarse, permeable sands or calcarenites are poorly compressible and are likely to have been contaminated in drilling or coring. However, should one wish to obtain the interstitial water of a poorly compressible but permeable material, this can be done with a modified technique suggested by Scholl (1963; and oral commun., 1965). The sediment is placed in the cylinder and tamped down with the piston (no rubber and Teflon disk, but a filter paper aids in avoiding sticking). Then a fluid such as the epoxy plasticizer recommended by Scholl (1963) is poured in. The rubber and Teflon disks and the piston are introduced, and the pore water is squeezed out in the normal manner, squeezing being stopped when or before the immiscible liquid begins to appear in the effiuent.
In addition to being used in study of pore fluids in marine sedimentary strata, squeezers of the type described here may potentially be useful in groundwater investigations. Lusczynski and Swarzenski (1962) pointed out the usfulness of studies of interstitial water for such work, particularly in areas of saline-water infiltration. The present squeezer offers the possibility of making water extraction more convenient, and of extending the technique to relatively compact materials and very small samples such as may be obtained in sidewall cores. Improved extraction techniques may facilitate the analysis of interstitial water as a technique complementary to electrical-log evaluation and to flow and pumping tests. Whereas the most permeable parts of aquifers may not always be

amenable to interstitial-water analysis, some of these zones grade transitionally into less permeable strata that are suitable for analysis and may carry water of the same quality. By studying the water in transitional beds, fresh-water aquifers have been detected (work still in progress) in marine strata under the Atlantic Ocean many miles east of the Florida coast.

AUTOMATIC BATTERY CHARGER FOR FIELD USE
By THO~'AAS 0. DANDO, Washington, D.C.

Abstract.-A new, automatic batter:y charger, designed and develop~d by the USGS Topograp}lic Division, reiieves field engineers of the attendant care required to properly recharge batteries used with electronic equipment. The unit can re. charge, simultaneously, as many as three 12-volt batteries to their full capacity in an overnight period.
Field engineers of the Topographic Division of the U.S. Geological Survey engaged in control surveys rely on rechargeable storage batteries as a source of power for their equipment. For recharging the batteries, the engineers have begun using a new automatic charger, developed by the Geological Survey.
The unit (fig. 1), equipped with solid-state components, is physically small (8 X 10 X 8 inches) , which makes it convenient for field use. It is capable of withstanding extremes of temperature, shock, and vibration commonly met in field environments. It has the capacity to charge three 12-volt batteries simultaneously and to recharge them fully in an overnight period. Moreover, it adapts to either lead-acid or nickel-cadmium batteries.. The most important advantage of the new charger is that it provides a controlledrate charge which will cut off automatically when the batteries reach rated voltage.
DEVELOPMENT
The need for the charger became apparent in 1963 after a study of the causes of numerous reported bat.tery failures. Analysis of the problem i~dicated that proper charging would provide much longer battery life and more dependable service. Contrary to popular conception, Division engineers found that recharging a battery properly is not a simple procedure. Regardless of the type, a battery must usually be recharged every day after normal work hours. Connecting a battery to a conventional charger and leaving it for any arbitrary length of time almost assuredly results in either undercharging it, with loss in dependability,

or overcharging it, with damage to the cells. The lead-acid battery is relatively inexpensive and
able to withstand charging abuse, but because of its weight, it is seriously limited in many field situations. The nickel-cadmium battery, on the other hand, is compact, lightweight, and therefore extensively used in the field. With proper treatment it has almost indefinite life. However, it is very expensive and easily damaged by improper charging. Consequently, the ability of the charger to save money, by assuring reliable service and long life for nickel-cadmium batteries, has already been demonstrated in field use.
In a review of the commercial battery chargers on
the market, design engineers found that, for field use, none had all the features desired-compactness, rugged construction, automatic operation, and the capability of handling, simultaneously, both lead-acid and nickelcadmium batteries. These considerations led to the fabrication, in February 1965, of the first production model of the new charger.
GENERAL CONSTRUCTION AND OPERATION
The circuitry is housed in a metal case, whose front face provides a mount for the control switches, indicator lamps, fuses, and output jacks (fig. 1). Inside the case, room is provided for storage of a power cable, battery leads, and spare parts. The storage space is accessible by means of a hinged back cover. On the inside face of the cover are printed a circuit diagram and a set of operating instructions.
The unit has three charging channels. One channel is designed for nickel-cadmium, 12-v batteries only, but each of the other two channels is adaptable, by a· switch, to either nickel-cadmium or lead-acid 12-v batteries. The channels can function separately or simultaneously. A battery to be charged is connected to the charger on the proper channel, and the charger is turned on. A red indicator lamp shows that the battery is accepting current. As the battery voltage rises,

control circuits cause the charging current to diminish. This prevents overcharging which would result in gassing of the battery cells. When the battery reaches rated voltage, the charging stops and a green "charged" lamp lights. If the battery, because of a bad cell, will not accept a charge, the two indicator lamps pulsate rapidly on and off.
If the charged battery is left on the charger, a low external circuit drain and internal battery leakage cause it to slowly discharge a small fraction of its total capacity. When this drain lowers the charge to a preset point, the sensors again switch the system to "charge." This cycle continues as long as the battery is connected to the charger.
ELECTRICAL CIRCUITS
The circuit layout in schematic form is shown in figure 2. Channel 3 is not included because it is identical with channel 2. A detailed explanation of channel
1 follows: With the line switch 8 1 closed, the step-
down transformer T 1 reduces the 110-v a-c supply to 12 v a-c. Silicon rectifiers CR1 and CR2 convert this to full-wave pulsating d-e voltage with an effective

value of about 15 v; actual pulse amplitude varies from 0 to about 18 v.
With a discharged battery attached to output ter-
minals J 1 and J 2 and channel switch 82 closed, a volt-
age develops across the voltage divider network R3 and R5• This makes the gate of silicon-controlled rectifier SCR1 more pos:tive than its cathode. With this condition, SCR1 conducts, thus admitting a charge to the battery. By its nature, a silicon-controlled rectifier will conduct, once fired by a gate pulse, as long as the anode is positive with respect to the cathode. Although the cathode of SCR1 is tied to the positive battery terminal, with a pulse-type input the gate and anode are more positive than the cathode for part of each cycle. Thus SCR1 conducts intermittently. As the battery voltage increases, conduction time decreases. Hence, the rate of charging is inversely proportional to the battery voltage. This automatic
charge-rate taper prevents overcharging. No current-
limiting resistors are needed in series with the battery
because the transformer output is filtered by capacitors
c1 and c2 to avoid high peak voltages.
While charging progresses, a positive potential on

the gate makes SORa conduct, lighting the "charging" indicator lamp La. Resistor R4 limits the gate current and prevents it from being overdriven. Zener diode CR5 is a reference diode; the breakover voltage at which it conducts is established in its construction. Thus CR5 sets the voltage level at .which SORa fires. R6 is a voltage-dropping resistor that limits the voltage across lamp La. Although the lamp's ·Operating voltage is 24 v, the series resistor Rs reduces the lamp voltage appreciably below this amount and increases the life of the lamp. This design is an important feature of all the lamp circuits.
When the battery reaches full voltage, a sensing circuit acts to stop the charging current flow. (A fully charged, nominal-12-v lead-acid battery has a terminal voltage of about 13.8 v, and a nickel-cadmium battery has a terminal voltage of 14.5 v.) The battery potential develops across R2 and R1 in parallel with the battery. Being a high resistance net, this path consumes little power. Capacitors C1 and C2 across . the resistances act as filters for the load (the battery) and zener-diode sensor CRa. In this case (for a nominal-12-v nickel-cadmium battery) a 9-v zener diode was selected, and the potentiometer was set for a potential of slightly above 9 v when the battery is at full potential. When the battery reaches full charge, the 9-v potential between th_e sliding contact of R 7 and a ground point causes zener diode ORa to conduct.
This triggers SOR2 into conduction, which in turn lights the "charged" indicator lamp L 2. Even more

important, conduction in this path redistributes the voltage drop across the divider network Ra and R5. The voltage at the junction of Ra ·and R5, and consequently at the gate of SOR1, is now below the cathode potential of SOR1 and therefore stops conduction to the battery. The voltage across zener diode OR5 falls below its breakover voltage, thus removing the gate signal from SORa. Under this condition, when the pulse input to SORa falls to zero, SORa stops conduct-
ising and the "charging" indicator lamp L 3 turned off.
The lamp remains off until conduction through L2 ceases. Resistor R9 in parallel with L 2 serves to keep the channel operating even if L 2 burns out.
If the battery remains connected to the charger, the battery voltage drops a small amount because of internal leakage and a small flow through R 2 and R 7• This drain, though small, eventually lowers the battery voltage enough to block ORa a~d stop conduction through SOR2. This restarts a charging cycle to maintain the battery at full potential.
The sensing networks for channels 2 and 3 differ only slightly from that of channel 1. Switch Saa adapts channel2 to either type of battery. Potentiometer Rs is provided to change the cutoff voltage to match the slightly lower voltage of the lead-acid battery. Otherwise, the circuits are the same.
The new charger has proved to be a dependable, money-saving piece of equipment, capable of properly charging the light but expensive nickel-cadmium batteries and assuring their long life.
