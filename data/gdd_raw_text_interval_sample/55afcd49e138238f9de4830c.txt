Introduction
The Hualapai Indian Reservation study is an integrated investigation combining geophysical and geological studies by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS). Funding for the study vas provided by the USGS under an agreement with the U.S. Bureau of Indian Affairs to compile and summarize geophysical and geological Information to assess potential mineral resources in the area. This report presents and evaluates the results of these geophysical studies made on the Reservation*
The Hualapal Indian Reservation is located in northwest Arizona along the south rim of the Grand Canyon of the Colorado River, about 40 Biles east of Kingaan, Arizona, and 75 miles vest of Flagstaff, Arizona (fig. 1). It is bounded on the north by Grand Canyon National Park and Lake Mead recreation area. Road access into the reservation is by U.S. Highway 66. The survey areas are reached by several paved and unimproved roads within the reservation.
Geologically, the area of study is located at the southern extent of the Colorado Plateau with the stratigraphic section ranging from the Mlssissippian Redwall Limestone to the Triassic Chinle Formation. Breccia pipes that occur within the area are the result of a solution collapse within the Redwall Liasstone and stoplng of the overlying strata, and are not associated with volcanic rocks (Wenrieh, USGS, mineralisation of breccia pipes in northern Arizona, unpub. report). Karst development in the Redwall Limestone began in 5he Misslssipplan and either continued to the Triassic or was reactivated during that time. Mineralization apparently occurred shortly thereafter, sometime during the Mesozoie. This mineralisation commonly occurred within modules and concretions associated with pyrite and goethite, within a sandstone matrix, or along features. This report presents and evaluates the ?s«5«lts of the geophysical studies without extensive interpretation.
Geophysical Methods
Tills study uses a multi-method geophysical approach to determine the geophysical characteristics of breccia pipes that are aost diagnostic as exploration tools, particularly on th 1. Coconlno Plateau where tree cover limits helicopter reconnaissance napping. Variations of aagnetite content and rock density were determined by aagnetic and gravity field measurements. Sevaral electromagnetic (EH) methods were used to measure the electrical characteristics of the breccia pipes and surrounding host rocks. Among the frequency-domain electromagnetic methods (FDEM) used were VLF (very low frequency), loop-loop (slingram) measurements, AMI (audio-magnetotellurics) soundings, and telluric electric field profiles. In addition to the FDEM methods, aost exploration sites include a time-domain electromagnetic (IDEM) profile. A complete description of the VLF electromagnetic methods is found in Telford et al., 1976. The VLF method measures Magnetic and electrical responses of a vertically polarized radio-wave transmitted at frequencies up to 24*0 KHz from one of a number of powerful radio communications stations located around the world. Conductivity of the earth at the measuring site, is one of several other factors affecting the propagation of the radio wave as it oves across the earth. Exploration depth of the VLF method ranges froa a few aeters to several tens of meters, depending on the local resistivity of the *arth and the frequency of the transmitted radio-wave.

The theory of loop-loop electromagnetic methods (slingram) Is described In detail by Keller and Frischknecht (1966) mud Frischknecht (1967). EM fields are transmitted into the ground through a coil and components of the EM field are measured at several descrete frequencies at a fixed distance from the transmitter coil. In the present survey measurements were made at frequencies of 111, 220, 440, 888 and 1777 Bz; the separation between transmitter and receiver was 200 meters. Lateral changes of conductivity within 100 meters of the surface were mapped effectively by the method.
The theory of the Time Domain Electromagnetics (IDEM) method is described in Kuo and Cho, 1980. The IDEM system measures the fields of secondary induced current transients created in the ground by a transmitter loop. These eddy currents set up a secondary magnetic field which can be detected by a receiver loop. Since the eddy currents do not cease flowing instantly when the transmitted current is switched off but decay gradually, their presence is showa by the decaying or transient voltages that they Induce in the receiver loop. The longer these transient voltages persist, the better the conductor. The TDEM system is sensitive to small conductivity contrasts and because of the relatively long time-periods involved the method allows a greater depth of exploration than VLF or slingram methods. Exploration depth is generally considered to be two or three times the loop diameter.
Discussion of Results
Seven sites were selected for this geophysical study. Two sites (494 and 387) are thought to be classic examples of mineralized breccia pipes. Site 534 with its 700 to 800 meter depression was chosen for comparison because of s lack of surface mineral traces.
Sites 220, 221, 222 and 472 are generally thought to show stratabound copper mineralization. Circular drainage around these sites suggests that they may be collapse breccia pipes. Geophysical measurements were made along surveyed lines shown in figure 2.
Magnetic profiles were made at all sites. A magnetic survey at site 220 -j&Q recorded on a grid at 50-meter intervals along traverses oriented normal to the northeast baseline and 50 meters apart (fig. 3). The magnetic data were grldded and contoured (fig. 4) by use of a program by Webrlng, 1981, and Godson and Vebring, 1982. The most significant feature of this magnetic contour map is a subcircular ring of magnetic highs and lows of about 20 gammas amplitude.
A gravity profile was run along the NE baseline of site 220 (fig. 5), and the profile shows a high of about 0.2 mgal located over the surface expression of the pipe but offset slightly northeast. Beneath the same area of alteration (between stations 400 and 600), the out-of-phase slingram profile data (fig. 6) show a conductive response at 1777 Bz, suggesting that a relatively shallow conductor is present. A VLF profile made along the NE baseline (fig. 7), although noisy, suggests a small (50 to 200 ohm-meter) low la apparent resistivity. The low is sharpest near station 600 on the SW-NE profile. Near-surface lateral variations of resistivity are a probable cause of scattered VLF apparent resistivity values along this profile; however, apparent-resistivity low at station 600 does correlate with the slingram data

and the gravity high. Abrupt changes in TDEM voltage readings from soundings taken along the NE baseline (fig. 8) also correlate with the magnetic and §1 ingrain data and the gravity high. An interpreted electric section based on TDEM data shows'* distinct change in resistivity at a depth of about 290 meters (fig. 9). An apparent resistivity pseudosection based on TDEM data shows low near-surface resistivity between stations 400 and 600 (fig. 10).
Site 287 is located about eight miles northeast of the paved road from U.S. Highway 66 to the Hilltop parking lot (fig. 1). A more detailed location map is seen in figure 11. Previous exploration at site 287 included diamond core drilling. Casing left in some of the holes no doubt Interfered with the results of the magnetic survey. The magnetic survey (fig. 12) was restricted to the immediate vicinity of the breccia pipe; thus, the regional magnetic contrast of mineral! ted to unmineralized rocks, if any, was not seen.
Site 472 is located near Lagoon Lake about three miles east of site 220 (fig. 13). Near-surface mineralization of copper is present in shallow pits and trenches in the area.
Site 494 is located at the edge of Mohawk Canyon, a major tributary to the Grand Canyon of the Colorado River (fig. 14). Topography due to the proximity of the Canyon causes severe problems in interpreting the electrical data. Magnetic and VLF profiles were made along the traverses shown in figure 15, s*ith the magnetic profile (fig* 17) showing a low from two- to- four gansaas between stations 0 to 100 ©n the SW-NE traverse. This magnetic low decreases slightly (about two gammas) along the. traverse between stations 250 and 350. The VLF profile (fig. 16) shows consistency between the apparent ?esistivity values received from the two transmitting stations (NAA « Jim Creek W« t KUt * Cutler, Me) with changes in apparent resistivity of 200 ©hamsters present between stations 200 and 250 on the SW-NE traverse. A Mag*i5£ic profile made aloixg the SW-NE traverse (fig. 17) probably reflects the topographic effect of the nearby Mohawk Canyon. The TDEM profile (fig. 18) snows a drop in voltage at 300 aeters along the NS traverse. An apparent resistivity pseudosection (fig. 19) based on TDEM data shows fairly
lithology at the shallower depths
Site 534 is located near the northeastern boundary of the Hualapal Reservation (fig* 20). Geophysical measurements were made along the profile shown in figure 21. Little surface mineralization Is evident. Slingram data (fig* 22) suggest a shallow conductive zone that exists at the north and south sdgss of the topographic lows leading into a depression. A VLF profile shows increasing apparent resistivity at about 700 meters (fig. 23). A TDEM profile (fig. 24) shows decreasing voltage with depth at station 250 and 750 suggesting correlation with the shallow conductive zones interpreted from the sllngram data. An Interpreted electric section (fig. 25) shows a decrease in resistivities at depths of approximately 250 meters that could indicate the presence of a more conductive area at or below 250 meters.

Summary Of the seven sites studied on the Bualapai Indian Reservation, three of them (287, 472, «nd 494) present topographic and cultural interference that render the geophysical data of limited use. At site 534, although the Magnetic profile did not indicate sufficient changes in magnetic character for interpretation, the TDEM profile suggests a conductive tone at and below a depth of about 250 meters (fig. 25). Along the same profile, a lack of response to VLF measurements indicates an-absence of near-surface conductive features (fig. 23). The most extensive and Illuminating geophysical work vas done In the area comprising sites 220, 221, and 222. This area Included fairly gentle terrain vlth homogeneous geologic features and no cultural Interference; hence, the geophysical techniques used accurately measure changes In density, magnetic character, and conductivity which could differentiate between possible breccia pipes and surrounding rock. The small magnetic anomalies at site 220 that surround the excavated area at the intersection of the baselines suggest magnetic sources that should be further Investigated by drilling exploration. Shallow conductive zones are seen along the profile line between 400 and 600 meters In the Slingram profile (fig. 6) and along the apparent resistivity pseudosectlon derived from TDEM data. The Slingram profile, using 200-meter coll separation, suggests conductive rocks from the surface to a maximum of 100 meters depth, correlating with the high conductivity shown at shallow depths by the TDEM in figure 10. The extensive geophysical picture at sites 220 and 221 suggest that geologic drilling would be most favorable at that area. Previous drilling has been done by Western Nuclear Corp., and assessing that data would help better define the present geophysical data.
