In Brief
Smith et al. show that the body plan of an animal phylum, Tardigrada, originated by loss of a large part of the body. This part corresponds to the entire thorax and nearly the entire abdomen of insects. The results show that the body architecture of a phylum can evolve by a more dramatic loss of body parts than had been anticipated.

SUMMARY
The superphylum Panarthropoda (Arthropoda, Onychophora, and Tardigrada) exhibits a remarkable diversity of segment morphologies, enabling these animals to occupy diverse ecological niches. The molecular identities of these segments are speciﬁed by Hox genes and other axis patterning genes during development [1, 2]. Comparisons of molecular segment identities between arthropod and onychophoran species have yielded important insights into the origins and diversiﬁcation of their body plans [3–9]. However, the relationship of the segments of tardigrades to those of arthropods and onychophorans has remained enigmatic [10, 11], limiting our understanding of early panarthropod body plan diversiﬁcation. Here, we reveal molecular identities for all of the segments of a tardigrade. Based on our analysis, we conclude that tardigrades have lost a large intermediate region of the body axis—a region corresponding to the entire thorax and most of the abdomen of insects—and that they have lost the Hox genes that originally speciﬁed this region. Our data suggest that nearly the entire tardigrade body axis is homologous to just the head region of arthropods. Based on our results, we reconstruct a last common ancestor of Panarthropoda that had a relatively elongate body plan like most arthropods and onychophorans, rather than a compact, tardigrade-like body plan. These results demonstrate that the body plan of an animal phylum can originate by the loss of a large part of the body.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Understanding the origin of animal body plans has been a longstanding issue in evolutionary biology, ever since Darwin struggled to reconcile his theory with the early fossil record of animals [12]. The body plans of the panarthropod phyla are based on a conserved segmental architecture. Within this conserved architecture exists an incredible degree of morphological diversiﬁcation, to an extent that recognizing homologous segmented regions among distantly related panarthropods has historically

been difﬁcult. Recently, this difﬁculty has been circumvented in onychophoran and arthropod studies by identifying homologous segmented regions based on their molecular identities [3–8]. The body plan of tardigrades is relatively compact and invariant, consisting of just a head and four leg-bearing segments (Figure 1). Understanding panarthropod body plan diversiﬁcation requires insight into the relationships of tardigrade segments to those of arthropods and onychophorans; indeed, this is important for deciphering the ancestral condition from which all panarthropods diversiﬁed. However, nothing is known about molecular identities of tardigrade segments, impeding our understanding of body plan diversiﬁcation within Panarthropoda.
Hox genes provide molecular identities to regions of the anteroposterior body axis across Bilateria [1]. To illuminate the molecular identities of tardigrade segments, we initially focused our investigation on the Hox genes of the tardigrade Hypsibius dujardini. We identiﬁed the same set of candidate Hox genes in our H. dujardini genome [13] and in mixed-stage transcriptome assemblies. Based on a phylogenetic analysis (Figure S1A) and the presence of diagnostic protein residues (Figure S1C), we identiﬁed orthologs of ﬁve Hox genes (Figure 2 and Table S1): labial (Hd-lab), Hox3 (Hd-Hox3), Deformed (Hd-Dfd), fushi tarazu (Hd-ftz), and three Abdominal-B paralogs (Hd-Abd-B1–Hd-AbdB3). The Hox genes proboscipedia (pb), Sex combs reduced (Scr), Antennapedia (Antp), and at least one representative of Ultrabithorax (Ubx) and abdominal-A (abd-A) are reconstructed as ancestral for Panarthropoda [14] but are absent in our H. dujardini genome and transcriptome assemblies. To verify that the H. dujardini complement of Hox genes is representative of tardigrades, we looked for Hox genes in the transcriptomes of two distantly related tardigrade species, Paramacrobiotus richtersi and Milnesium tardigradum [16], which, with H. dujardini, span the class Eutardigrada [17]. We identiﬁed the same set of Hox orthologs in these species as we did in H. dujardini (Figures 2, S1B, and S1C and Table S1) but with only single copies of Abd-B in P. richtersi and M. tardigradum.
Our analyses suggest three interesting features concerning the evolution of the tardigrade Hox gene complex. First, an analysis of nucleotide sequences suggests that ancestral tardigrades had a single copy of Abd-B, which gave rise to Hd-Abd-B1–Hd-Abd-B3 through duplication events in the H. dujardini lineage (Figure S1B0). Supporting this conclusion, the predicted Abd-B protein sequences of H. dujardini share unique residues at two positions within the homeodomain where the other tardigrades of this study exhibit residues characteristic of other panarthropods (Figure S1C). In terms of protein

sequence similarity, compared to Hd-Abd-B2 (Figure S1A), or in terms of the length of the predicted protein sequence, compared to Hd-Abd-B3 (Figure S2B), the predicted protein sequence of Hd-Abd-B1 most closely resembles Abd-B sequences from other panarthropods, so we narrowed our focus to this paralog. Second, our analyses suggest that pb, Scr, Antp, and Ubx/abd-A orthologs were lost in the tardigrade lineage (Figure 2), an unprecedented degree of loss in Panarthropoda. Third, unlike in many animal genomes [14, 15], in the H. dujardini genome, several predicted protein-coding genes are dispersed among Hox genes (Figures 2 and S3). This result is consistent with the loss of some Hox genes and disorganization of the Hox cluster seen together in certain other animal genomes [18]. Tardigrade segments develop simultaneously [19, 20]; disorganization of the Hox cluster has been suggested to be a prerequisite for the evolution of this developmental mode [21].
Next, we developed in situ hybridization methods for tardigrades, and we used these methods to determine the embryonic expression domains of H. dujardini Hox genes. We found an anterior-to-posterior order of expression domains that is similar to the order seen in other animals. At 35 hr post egg laying (hpl), Hd-lab exhibited the strongest expression in the ﬁrst leg-bearing segment; by 55 hpl, strong expression of this gene was conﬁned to the pharyngeal bulb (Figures 3B, 3I, and S4A). We detected strongest expression of Hd-Hox3 in the second and third legbearing segments, which resolved into expression in the ganglion of the second leg-bearing segment and the legs of the sec-

ond and third leg-bearing segments by 55 hpl (Figures 3C, 3I, and S4B). Throughout development, Hd-Dfd exhibited localized expression near the developing ganglion of the third leg-bearing segment (Figures 3D, 3I, and S4C). Hd-ftz signal developed in an anterior region of the fourth leg-bearing segment, with strong expression near the ganglion of this segment at 55 hpl (Figures 3E, 3I, and S4D). Finally, Hd-Abd-B1 expression was strongest in a posterior region of the fourth leg-bearing segment, which included the base of the legs (Figures 3F, 3I, and S4E).
Previously, researchers have compared anterior expression boundaries of Hox genes to identify homologous segments across the Onychophora and Arthropoda [3–6]. The anterior expression domains of Hd-Hox3, Hd-Dfd, and Hd-ftz match the expression domains of their homologs in arthropods and onychophorans if tardigrade segments are aligned one to one with onychophoran and arthropod segments in anteroposterior order (Figure 4A). This alignment suggests that the tardigrade body axis is primarily homologous to just the head region of arthropods and directly supports the hypothesis that the diversity of head appendages of arthropods and onychophorans evolved from legs [6, 24, 25]. This result also addresses a current debate about whether the tardigrade head is homologous to several anterior segments of arthropods [26, 27], or whether it is composed of a single segment [28]. Our alignment of segments based on Hox gene expression supports the latter hypothesis (Figure 4A). To further test the composition of the tardigrade head, we investigated embryonic expression of the head gap gene orthodenticle (otd), which is restricted to the ﬁrst segment in most arthropods and onychophorans during early stages of segmentation [4, 22, 23]. Hd-otd exhibited strong expression broadly across the head of H. dujardini during early stages of segmentation (Figure 3G), buttressing our conclusion that the head of tardigrades is homologous to the ﬁrst segment of other panarthropods. While we generally found conservation of gene expression patterns, Hd-lab was expressed at relatively high levels in the second segment (Figures 3B and 3I), unlike in other panarthropods [3–9]. Under our model of segment homologies (Figure 4A), this implies that there has been an anterior expansion of lab expression in the tardigrade lineage or a posterior retraction of lab expression in other panarthropods. We cannot conﬁdently discriminate between these possibilities.
Our model of segment homologies suggests that the tardigrade body axis is reduced, relative to other panarthropods, comprising mostly anterior identity, in line with an earlier hypothesis based on nervous system anatomy [29]. How did this evolve? The expression pattern of the posterior marker Hd-Abd-B1 suggests that posterior identity is retained in the posterior of the tardigrade body axis, which indicates that simple truncation is not the answer. Expression of the posterior marker caudal (cad) [30, 31] in a posterior region of the fourth leg-bearing segment (Figures 3H and 3I) conﬁrms the retention of posterior identity. In other panarthropods [8] and distantly related annelid worms [14], an extensive intermediate trunk region is deﬁned by expression of orthologs of Antp, Ubx, and abd-A, genes that have been lost in the tardigrade lineage (Figure 4B). In H. dujardini, the anterior borders of ftz and Abd-B expression lie in the same segment, precluding the existence of segments with intermediate Hox identities between these markers in this species. Therefore, we propose that the reduced body axis of

tardigrades evolved through the loss of an intermediate trunk region in this lineage, a region corresponding to the entire thorax and most of the abdomen in insects. Based on our evidence supporting a reduction of the body axis in the tardigrade lineage, we conclude that a compact body plan is a tardigrade novelty, while the panarthropod ancestor possessed a more elongate body plan (Figure 4C). This conclusion is insensitive to the interrelationships of the panarthropod lineages; whether Tardigrada is the sister group of Arthropoda [32] or the earliest diverging panarthropod phylum [33, 34] is currently under debate.
The loss of Hox genes is unlikely to be the cause of segment loss because Hox genes typically specify segment identities rather than regulate segment production [35]. Supporting this idea, the loss of pb and Scr in the tardigrade lineage does not appear to correspond to the loss of any particular segment.

However, Hox genes might become dispensable when the segments they once speciﬁed are lost, leading to loss of such Hox genes through neutral processes [35]. We suggest that the loss of Antp and Ubx/abd-A in the genomes of tardigrades followed the loss of the intermediate segments they originally speciﬁed. Unlike in tardigrades [19, 20], in many panarthropods and other animals a large fraction of the body axis develops by terminal addition through posterior growth; terminal addition may be ancestral for Bilateria [36] and has been suggested to be a trait of a stem group tardigrade lineage [37]. We speculate that reduction, and ultimately loss, of terminal addition accounts for the loss of intermediate segments in the tardigrade lineage. In this view, most of the tardigrade body axis represents the short germband of other panarthropods, i.e., the few anterior segments that appear simultaneously during development

before terminal segment addition commences. This model would require that the posterior region of the short germband be respeciﬁed as the posterior of the body axis, since segments with posterior-most identity are normally the last segments to emerge through terminal addition, and posterior identity is retained in tardigrades. Diversity in segment number in other panarthropods emerges in the body region that is produced through terminal addition. We speculate that the loss of terminal addition in the tardigrade lineage explains the invariant segment number of this phylum.
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
Assembly and Annotation Transcriptome assemblies were derived from 100 bp paired-end Illumina reads or from reads downloaded from NCBI’s SRA database (accessions SRX426237–SRX426240) and assembled using Trinity [38] (T.C.B., unpublished data). Our genome assembly was derived from short insert mate pair

and Moleculo long read libraries generated from DNA extracted from H. dujardini [13]. Assembly was performed with the Celera assembler version 8.1 [39]. Annotations for the H. dujardini genome assembly were generated using the automated genome annotation pipeline MAKER2 [40]. Our H. dujardini genome sequencing resulted in an assembly of 212.3 Mb with an average estimated coverage of 126X. Our assembly contains 95.16% of core eukaryotic genes (CEGMA).
Gene Identiﬁcation We identiﬁed candidate genes in our genome and transcriptome databases by reciprocal BLAST searches using arthropod and onychophoran sequences as queries. For phylogenetic analyses, we used alignments of homeodomain protein sequences or homeobox nucleotide sequences. Our amino acid matrix was based on the matrix used to identify Hox orthologs in an onychophoran [8]. We implemented the LG model [41] (for amino acid alignments) or the HKY85 model [42] (for nucleotide alignments) with an estimated gamma shape parameter with four substitution rate categories. Maximum likelihood analyses were performed with PhyML [43] with 500 bootstrap replicates. Bayesian analyses were performed in MrBayes [44]. Amino acid analyses ran for 1,200,000

generations. The nucleotide analysis ran for 600,000 generations. Posterior tree distributions were sampled every 100 generations. Burn-in = 7,500 for amino acid analyses; burn-in = 1,500 for nucleotide analysis.
Cloning We ampliﬁed genes from embryonic H. dujardini cDNA by PCR and cloned PCR products into the pCR4-TOPO vector (Invitrogen). Primers used in this study were as follows: Hd-lab, 50-CAGGATGCTCGCTATGCTAATTCCA-30, 50-AGTCTCATTGAGGGAGAGCTGGTT-30; Hd-Hox3, 50-GGAGCAGCAGA CCTTTTCTCCTAC-30, 50-CGCAATCACTTTTAGGGATGGACCT-30; Hd-Dfd, 50-CATTTGGCTCCATGCCTTATCAGTC-30, 50-TGGTGTTGGGCAATTTATGG TCCT-30; Hd-ftz, 50-GTACCACTACTGCACGTCCTTACAG-30, 50-TCTCCAG CTTCTTCTCCTTCTTGTAC-30; Hd-Abd-B1, 50-ATCGACAACTTCCCGTCC TATCAC-30, 50-GTTGGTGGAACTTTTGTGGTTGGA-30; Hd-otd, 50-GTTCCC GCACCGAGGAAACAG-30, 50-CTCTCACGTCCTCCACGCTGA-30; Hd-cad, 50-ATCATCCGGCGTACAATATGAACA-30, 50-AAATGGGCGACTCTCATAAA CAGC-30 .
In Situ Hybridization Digoxigenin-labeled probes were produced using T3 or T7 RNA polymerase (Promega). Sense strand probes were used as negative controls. Embryos were removed from parental exuviae with a 25G needle and then permeabilized in a 5 U/ml chitinase (Sigma), 10 mg/ml chymotrypsin (Sigma) solution in 50 mM potassium phosphate buffer (pH 6.0) for 1 hr. Embryos were rinsed three times for 5 min in 0.5X PBtween (0.5X PBS; 0.1% Tween20; in DEPC water) and ﬁxed in a 4% paraformaldehyde, 33% heptane solution in 0.5X PBtween for 30 min while shaking vigorously. This was followed by ﬁve washes for 5 min each in 0.5X PBtween. Embryos were then rinsed in 25%, 50%, 70%, and 90% methanol in 0.5X PBtween for 5 min each, followed by three washes in 100% methanol, and stored at À20C. Before hybridization, embryos were taken through a reverse graded series of methanol washes, followed by three washes in 0.5X PBtween. Embryos were removed from their eggshells with a 25G needle. The acetylation and hybridization steps followed existing procedures designed to minimize loss of small embryos [45], with 0.5X PBtween substituted for 1X PBtween, and 20X SSC at pH 6.0 substituted for 20X SSC at pH 4.5. We added 1 ml of boiled and sheared salmon sperm (40 mg/ml) to probe solution (ﬁnal concentration $0.5 mg/ml DIG-labeled riboprobe in Hybe buffer [50% formamide; 25% 20X SSC, pH 6.0; 0.1% Tween20; in DEPC water]) after the probe was heated rather than adding salmon sperm directly to the Hybe buffer. We hybridized probes for 16 hr at 60C. Post-hybridization washes were performed at 60C with all buffers heated to this temperature. Embryos were washed ﬁve times quickly, followed by ﬁve 20-min washes in plain Hybe buffer. Next we washed embryos ﬁve times quickly and for 30 min with 2X SSC, 0.1% CHAPS. This was followed by two 30-min washes with 1X SSC, 0.1% CHAPS and two 30-min washes with 0.2X SSC, 0.1% CHAPS. We then washed embryos twice with 0.5X PBtween at room temperature. Embryos were incubated in blocking solution (2% BSA; 50% blocking reagent solution [BRS]; in 0.5X PBtween) for 2 hr at room temperature. BRS consists of 10% blocking reagent (Roche) in maleic acid buffer (pH 7.5). Embryos were incubated overnight at 4C in 1:1,500 anti-DIG-AP (Roche) in blocking solution. Next, embryos were washed ﬁve times quickly and ﬁve times for 10 min in maleic acid buffer (pH 7.5). We then washed embryos three times quickly in alkaline phosphatase developing solution (100 mM NaCl; 50 mM MgCL; 100 mM Tris, pH 9.5; 0.1% Tween20). We developed in situ signal in BM Purple (Roche). To stop development of the in situ reaction, we washed embryos in 0.5X PBtween. Embryos were then post-ﬁxed in 100% ethanol for 3 min, followed by a 0.5X PBtween wash.
Imaging and Quantiﬁcation Embryos were mounted in DAPI Fluoromount-G (SouthernBiotech). To collect ﬂuorescent in situ data, we took advantage of the ﬂuorescent properties of the chromogenic precipitate [46]. z stacks were captured on a Zeiss 710 LSM using an EC Plan-Neoﬂuor 1003/1.30 oil objective, 633 nm excitation wavelength, with data collected for emission wavelengths between 685 and 759 nm. Maximum projections were produced in ImageJ. Maximum projections are from slices of a z stack of the medial region of embryos in all cases except Figure 3G, which shows the lateral region of the embryo. In ImageJ, a ten-pixel-wide line scan of the ventral embryonic region of maximum projec-

tions was used to measure ﬂuorescent intensity. The ﬂuorescence intensities we report are from raw data. We adjusted the brightness and contrast of images for ﬁgures in ImageJ. Methods used for phalloidin staining and anti b-tubulin staining were previously published [10].
