WATER-RESOURCES INVESTIGATIONS IN PUERTO RICO AND THE U.S. VIRGIN ISLANDS
by Thalia D. Veve and Joseph W. Troester, editors

ABSTRACT
This report reviews the activities of the Caribbean District ofthe U.S. Geological Survey, Water Resources Division, from 1986 to 1988. Each project in the District conducted during this period is described and the publications released in each project are listed. The report includes also a complete list of publications released during this period, and tables and maps showing all the surface-water, ground-water, and waterquality stations in the data-collection program in the District.
INTRODUCTION
The Caribbean District was established in 1958 to carry out the mission of the Water Resources Division of the U.S. Geological Survey in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands (fig. 1). District activities include research and the dissemination of information in the field of hydrology. Ninety-five scientists, technicians, and support staff are employed at the Caribbean District Office in the San Juan metropolitan area and the U.S. Virgin Islands Field Headquarters on St. Croix.
Hydrologic stations are maintained at selected locations throughout Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands to obtain records on stream flow and stage,

reservoir and lake elevations and storage, groundwater levels, spring discharge, sediment loads, and quality of surface and ground water. From 1986 to 1988, the Survey, in cooperation with government agencies in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands, increased its network to 52 continuous surface-water sites, 5 continuous reservoir sites, 65 ground-water observation wells, and 71 water-quality sites. Waterresources data are stored in the Survey's National Water Data Storage and Retrieval System. These data are integrated with other hydrogeologic observations and water-resources investigations and used by water planners and others involved in making decisions that affect water resources in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands.
About 125 hydrologic investigations have been conducted in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands since the Caribbean District office opened. These investigations have resulted in the publication of more than 250 abstracts, articles, books, and maps. During fiscal years 1986 to 1988, the Survey entered into agreement with 17 Federal and local agencies involving 29 hydrologic investigations in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. These investigations will provide information needed to answer hydrologic questions that are specific to the water-resource issues in the region. Additionally, some of the investigations will provide information on nationwide hydrologic

HYDROLOGIC RECORDS SECTION

The Hydrologic Records Section of the U.S. Geological Survey, Caribbean District, operates several networks of data collection stations. The information gathered at these stations is used extensively by those responsible for the management and planning of the water resources of Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. The availability of these data is also important for the support of ongoing and future projects within the Survey.
The data collected at stations in these networks by the Hydrologic Records Section include stream stage and discharge, suspended sediment, ground-water levels, and water quality. As of September 1988, the data included (1) stage and discharge records for 52 continuous streamflow gaging stations (48 in Puerto Rico and 4 in the U.S. Virgin Islands); (2) continuous stage records for 5 lakes; (3) water-quality records for 16 streamflow-gaging stations, 45 ungaged streamsites, 11 lake sites, 1 lagoon, and 1 bay; and (4) water-level records for 65 observation wells. The Hydrologic Records Section also collects data at

many sitps not in specific networks in support of ongoing prjojects. Most of the data are published in the annual report series entitled "Water Resources Data for Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands." Prior to publication the data are available in a provisional form from a computerized data storage and retrieval system which can be accessed by the Survey and several cooperating agencies.
The Hydrologic Records Section began compiling and publishing data in the report entitled "Water Resourcfcs Data for Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands," in 1970. The data report for Water Year 1988 wa£ the latest release in this series. The data report f0r Water Year 1989 is in preparation.
Since 1958, many agencies of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico and the territorial government of the U.S. Virgin Islands have cooperated with the Survey in the data collection. Data collection activities of the Hydrologic Records Section are carried out by a staff of 30 employees under the supervision of Russell Curtis.

The Caribbean District operates a network of streamflow stations throughout Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands (fig. 2). In Puerto Rico the network is operated under the general waterresources investigations programs coordinated by the Environmental Quality Board in cooperation with many commonwealth and federal agencies. During Water Year 1987, the network was composed of

41 stations. This number increased to 52 in 1988. Four additional stations are financed by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) as part of the federally-funded National Stream Quality Accounting Network (NASQAN). In the U.S. Virgin Islands the network consists of four recording streamflow stations.

SUSPENDED-SEDIMENT DATA COLLECTION
1964 Pedro Diaz USCOE, PREQB, and PRASA

Suspended-sediment data collection activities continued during water years 1986-1988. In 1986-87, suspended-sediment samples were collected daily at Rio Fajardo near Fajardo, Rio Tanam£ near Utuado and Rio Rosario near Hormigueros (fig. 4). The Rio Fajardo and Rio Rosario stations were operated in cooperation with the USCOE while the Rio Tanama station was operated in cooperation with the PREQB. Automatic sediment samplers were used at Rio Fajardo and Rio Rosario.

Significant changes occurred in the data collection network during Water Year 1988. The sediment station at Rio Fajardo was discontinued. However, three automatic sediment samplers were installed and operate4 in the Rio Grande de Loiza basin in an effort to! determine the sedimentation rate at Lago Carraizd. These stations are operated in cooperation with PRASA.

Date Project Began: Principal Investigator:

1983 Luis Santiago-Rivera

A knowledge of the frequency and magnitude of low flows is needed by managers of waste-allocation programs for the design of water-supply facilities and for water resource assessments. In 1983, the Caribbean District initiated, as part of the data collection program, a project to define the magnitude and frequency of low flows in Puerto Rico. A network of approximately 100 streamflow sites was selected on the eastern part of the island (fig. 3). Discharge measurements during drought and low flow conditions at these sites were made in 1983,1984 and 1985. In 1986, 1987, and 1988, attempts to make low-flow measurements were unsuccessful because of heavy rains during the measurement periods. The project

will continue over the next few years and will extend to other areas in Puerto Rico.

The determination of long-term changes in ground-water levels is an important aspect of the ground-water data-collection program in the District. Ground-water levels provide insight into the withdrawal and recharge rates of aquifers and are essential to the design, construction, and updating of ground-water flow models.
The ground-water levels network in Puerto Rico increased from 7 to 31 recorder-equipped wells during Water Year 1986. The twenty-four additional wells were installed as part of the North Coast Limestone Regional Aquifer System project discussed later in this report. During Water Year 1987, four additional wells equipped with recorders were added to the network in the south coast alluvial

aquiferk and two wells were discontinued, leaving a balance of 38 wells by the end of the year.
In the U.S. Virgin Islands, the ground-water levels network consisted of 7 wells equipped with recorders and 211 wells in which water levels were measured periodically during water years 1985-87. During Water Year 1988, the number of wells measured periodically was reduced to 18 but the number of recorder-equipped wells remained unchanged.
As of September 1988, the ground-water levels networ : in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands consisted of a total of 45 wells equipped with recorders and 18 wells measured periodically. Locations of these wells are shown in figure 5.

SURFACE-WATER QUALITY NETWORK
1968 Pedro Diaz PREQB, USCOE, and PRDOA

The District operated a network of 71 long-term water-quality stations in Puerto Rico in Water Year 1988 (fig. 6). Samples were collected bi-monthly from 56 streamflow stations and lagoons, and quarterly from six of the principal lakes in Puerto Rico. The surface-water quality network also included four stations supported by the Geological Survey as part of the National Stream Quality Accounting Network (NASQAN). Samples were collected bi-monthly at

two of those stations and quarterly at the other two stations.
Samples collected as part of the surface-water quality network are analyzed for a variety of constituents, including copper, manganese, cyanide, sulfide, phenols, iron and methyl blue active substance (MBAS). Analytical field and laboratory results indicate that some streams commonly have high concentrations of fecal coliform, fecal streptococcus bacteria, and suspended sediment.

GROUND-WATER QUALITY MONITORING
October 1982 Senen Guzman-Rios
PRASA

The ground-water quality monitoring program is a continuing program. In 1982, ground-water samples were collected from various wells around the island. From this preliminary reconnaissance it was determined that the water quality at some sites warranted frequent monitoring. In 1983, a water sampling program was established in Vega Alta (fig. 7) where some wells had been abandoned because of the presence of organic chemicals. Samples have been collected monthly from five wells and from three sites in the water distribution system at this site since 1983. Ad-

ditional sites were added to the sampling program in 1984. Since that time, water samples have been collected q uarterly from 5 wells in Ponce, and one each in Santa Isabel, Guayama and Arecibo. The samples from all five sites have been analyzed for volatile synthetic organic chemicals (VOCs).
Recent laboratory results showed concentrations of trichloroethylene (TCE) in some ground-water samples as high as 40 micrograms per liter (ttg/L). The mzcjcimum allowable level established by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency is

io

The Data Collection Platform (DCP) program began in Puerto Rico as a method to obtain real-time data of various types from stations throughout the island. The DCP is part of a satellite telemetry system which allows the Survey to monitor the behavior of selected streams with data updates every five minutes.
The system transmits the information from a field station to a geostationary satellite, and then from the satellite to the computer system. The first station equipped with a DCP in Puerto Rico is located at the Rio Grande de Loiza at Caguas. Data transmitted from this site was used as part of a demonstration at the 1984 World's Fair in New Orleans. By the end of Water Year 1986, the District had installed 12 DCPs throughout the island.
The DCP program increased during Water Year 1987 with the establishment of a flood alert-system

operated in cooperation with the PRDNR. This system consists of a network of rainfall and river-stage sensors that provide real-time data during heavy rains (fig. 8). This information is used by Commonwealth agencies responsible for issuing flood alerts. By the end of Water Year 1987, 18 DCP stations had been installed.
During 1988, the DCP program was expanded with the installation of three stations at reservoirs operated by PREPA (Garzas, Matrullas, and Guineo) and two stations at reservoirs operated by PRASA (Carraizo and Cidra) to provide real-time elevation and rainfall data. In addition, six new river-stage/rainfall stations were installed and equipped with DCPs in support of the flood-alert system operated in cooperation with commonwealth and federal agencies.

Considerable flooding along the north coast of Puerto Rico occurred during May 17-18, 1985. Particularly affected were the lower reaches of the Rio Grande de Manati and the Rio Grande de Arecibo. Significant flooding also occurred at Utuado and Jayuya. The floods of October 6-7, 1985 affected mostly rural areas in southern Puerto Rico. The most severe flooding was between Ponce and Santa Isabel. Flooding was also severe in Barceloneta on the north coast. Reports doumenting the extent and severity of these floods in some areas have been published. Flood maps describing the inundated areas in the lower Rio Grande de Manati valley and in the south coast are in preparation.

The U.S. Forest Service requested the assistance of the U.S. Geological Survey to determine the stagedischarge relation in three creeks crossed by the Bisley Road in the El Yunque rain forest. The stage-discharge relation was determined using the indirect method of discharge measurement at culverts. This method uses measured stage upstream and

downstrleam of the culvert and the culvert geometry to compute discharge based on hydraulic formulae.
The stage-discharge relations developed during this study were completed in 1988 and provided to the U.S. Forest Service. The project is completed.

HYDROLOGIC INVESTICATIONS SECTION

The Hydrologic Investigations Section of the Caribbean District is composed of a staff of 21 employees under the supervision of Arturo Torres, Assistant District Chief. The Section worked on a total of 27 water-resources investigations during 1986-88. The subjects of these investigations ranged

from the general hydrology of Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands to more site-specific waterresources problems. Of these investigations, 5 percent dealt with surface water, 85 percent with ground water, and 10 percent with water quality.

SUSPENDED-SEDIMENT TRANSPORT IN THE UPPER RIO GRANDE DE LOIZA BASIN, PUERTO RICO

PRDNR, USCOE, and USSCS

The Rio Grande de Loiza basin is the largest drainage basin in Puerto Rico. The river was dammed in 1953 to build a water-supply reservoir. Lago Loiza (also known locally as Lago Carrafzo) supplies about 50 percent of the water for the San Juan metropolitan area (about 110 million gallons per day (Mgal/d)).
Fluvial sediment carried into reservoirs by tributary streams is reducing the efficiency and useful life of almost all reservoirs in Puerto Rico. Lago Loiza had an original capacity of 21,763 acre-feet in 1953, but in July 1985 a bathymetric survey conducted at Lago Loiza indicated that the capacity of the reservoir had been reduced to 10,100 acre-feet. At that time the storage capacity of the reservoir was being reduced at a rate of 1.8 percent per year. At this rate, the useful life of Lago Loiza is estimated at 23 more years. Other bathymetric surveys were conducted in 1963,1971, and 1979.
Plans are being developed for three additional dams in the basin: Rio Grande de Loiza at Quebrada Arenas, Rio Cayaguas at Cerro Gordo, and Rio Valenciano near Juncos. The useful life of Lago Loiza and the design and construction of the new reservoirs will be greatly influenced by the amount of sediment transported along the system.

The purpose of this investigation is to collect and analyze sediment data in conjunction with land-use data. Results of the investigation may be used by Commonwealth agencies to design and implement soil-conservation practices in the basin and other measures to reduce erosion and sedimentation rates.
The first phase of an investigation on the subject was completed in 1988. Information was obtained on fluvial sediment transported from ten small- to medium-size drainage areas within the east-central part of Puerto Rico, ranging from less than 1 to about 90 -m" in size. The study covered an area of 208 m" from the headwaters of Rio Grande de Loiza to the Lago Loiza. It included the main stream and selected tributaries.
The first phase of the investigation included three years of data collection from a network of two dailyrecord stations and eight partial-record stations. Data collected during this phase indicates that most of the sediment transported by the streams is in suspension. Concentrations of suspended sediment exceeded 56,000 milligrams per liter in some samples. Suspended sediment in the streams is composed mostly of silt and clay. Sand content during high flows ranged from 6 to 80 percent.

CEER-UPR

In 1985 the District initiated a comprehensive study of the hydrology of Laguna Joyuda, a State Natural Reserve in western Puerto Rico. This shallow water lagoon is the habitat of many plants and animal species protected by local and federal agencies. The lagoon is relatively undisturbed by urban and industrial development that affects most coastal ecosystems. Human activities in the drainage basin include a few family dwellings on the southern and western edges of the lagoon and some cattle production. About 50 percent of the basin is used for pasture.
During the first two years of the study the emphasis

was on the collection of surface water, ground water, precipitation, and tidal-flow data necessary to determine the overall hydrologic budget for the lagoon. Surface >^ater inflow, ground water levels, precipitation and tidal-flow in the lagoon were measured. The one-dimensional Branch-Network flow model is being used to estimate tidal-flow through the lagoon's discharge channel. Much of 1988 was spent analyzing the data collected and calibrating the tidalflow model. The results will assist CEER and other agencies to better understand the hydrology of tropical coastal ecosystems so these areas can be protected from degradation.

LAGUNA SAN JOSE BATHYMETRIC AND WATER QUALITY SURVEY

Date Project Began: Principal Investigator: Cooperating Agency:

July 1986 Carlos Conde-Costas
PRHA

A bathymetric and water quality survey of Laguna San Jose, located between the municipios of San Juan and Carolina, was conducted in cooperation with the P.R. Highway Authority (PRHA). This agency is planning to relocate Highway PR-26. One segment of the proposed relocation of the highway would run along the northern shore of the lagoon. The elimination of some mangroves will be necessary to construct this segment of the highway. The PRHA has been requested to develop a series of islets where new mangroves could be grown.
The objective of the study was to assist PRHA in defining the best areas in the lagoon from which materials could be dredged and where the islets could be located. The investigation included a bathymetric survey of the entire lagoon, a more detailed survey in

selected areas, and a sampling program to determine selected chemical and physical characteristics of the water arid bottom sediments. The variation in velocity with depth was also studied at several stations.
Results of the study indicate that concentrations of selected water quality constituents vary only slightly throughout the lagoon. Organic pesticide concentrations in bottom sediments were relatively low throughout the lagoon but were somewhat higher at the northeastern section of the lagoon than in other areas. The organic chemicals detected most frequently were PCB, DDT, and Lindane. This study was completed and results were given to PRHA in 1986.

The Rio Puerto Nuevo basin is a small, highly developed urban basin in the metropolitan San Juan area, located in north-central Puerto Rico. The river runs from south to north through the town of Guaynabo, draining into San Juan Bay.
The objectives of this 2-year project are to determine the amount and particle size distribution of suspended-sediment moving past sediment stations along the Rio Puerto Nuevo and entering San Juan Bay. In addition, the particle size distribution of the bed material in the river is under study.

During 1988, four surface water and suspendedsediment stations were installed and operated. Each sediment station has a depth-integrated sampler as well as an automatic sampler. Collection of surfacewater data, suspended-sediment samples, and bed material also began in 1988. Laboratory analyses were performed on both suspended-sediment and bed material samples.
The data obtained in this study will be used by the USCOE in the design of a debris basin. The purpose of the debris basin is to trap sediment before it can accumulate in the concrete channel that is part of the Rio Puerto Nuevo Flood Control project.

The feasibility of injecting, storing, and recovering excess streamflow in an aquifer by artificial recharge through an injection well was investigated for a well site in the lower Rio Grande de Arecibo Valley, in Arecibo, Puerto Rico. Results of these tests indicated that although a reasonable percent of the injected freshwater can be recovered, further studies are necessary to test the effect of large-scale freshwater injection. Prevention of the inland migration of saline water may be an additional benefit of injection wells. This study was completed in 1988. Two additional reports have been approved for publication.

=^cT3*

The objective of the water-resources investigation of the Humacao-Naguabo area was to define the occurrence, availability, and quality of surface and ground water in the Humacao-Naguabo area. Surface water is the principal water-supply source in the study area. Rio Humacao and Rio Blanco are the major drainage networks and have the potential of supplying 13.7 Mgal/d. The quality of the surface water, however, is generally poor. Bacteria counts as high as 10,300,000 colonies per 100 milliliters for coliform and 1,900,000 colonies per 100 milliliters for streptococci have been observed in samples from Rio Humacao.
Ground-water use in the Humacao-Naguabo area in 1984 was 0.93 Mgal/d. The principal aquifer in the study area occurs within alluvial sediments, under

water-table conditions. Values of aquifer transmissivity r^nge from 600 to 2,000 square feet per day (ft/d);'storage coefficient of the aquifer is approxim&tely 0.02. Water-quality analyses of the ground water revealed that at several sites the USEPA Drinking Water Standards for iron, manganese, land total dissolved solids were exceeded.
A tWo-dimensional, mathematical ground water flow model of the Rio Humacao basin was developed to simulate the ground-water flow system and to determine the effects of additional ground-water withdrawals on the aquifer. Model results indicate that in the lower Rio Humacao basin if current ground^water use is increased by more than 0.72 Mgjal/d, saltwater intrusion into the aquifer could occur.

An inventory of ground-water wells in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands was conducted from October 1983 to September 1986. Information was gathered on approximately 4,215 ground-water wells. Although this number may include some abandoned or destroyed wells, the inventory indicated that the

number of wells in Puerto Rico had almost doubled since 1964. The number of wells increased from 2,282 in 1964 to 4,215 in 1986. In the north-coast province aquifers the number of wells increased from 761 in 1964 to 1,556 in 1986 and in the south-coast alluvial aquifers from 1,277 to 2,156 during this period.

The objectives of the study were to define the occurrence, availability, and quality of ground-water in the Lajas Valley. Field work for the water-resources investigation of the Lajas Valley was completed in September 1987.
The principal aquifer in the Lajas Valley is a nonhomogeneous, anisotropic confined aquifer consisting of alluvial deposits of Quaternary age. The potentiometric head in monitor wells can range from more than 3 feet (ft) above land surface to 30 ft below land surface. Values of aquifer transmissivity range from 700 to 8,000 ft2/d; the storage coefficient of the aquifer is approximately 9.3 x 10 .

Ground-water use in the Lajas Valley for 1986 was estimated to be 2.95 Mgal/d. Depending on the location of a well in the valley, pumpage rates can range from 5 to 300 gallons per minute (gal/min).
Ground-water quality varies greatly in the Lajas valley. Ground water in several wells exceeded the Environmental Protection Agency's limit for iron, manganese, and total dissolved solids. Chloride concentrations in excess of 5,000 milligrams per liter were measured in water samples from several wells. In general, high quality, ground-water supplies are limited in the Lajas Valley.

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has the responsibility for overseeing the implementation of the Underground Injection Control Program in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. To implement this program, a knowledge of the hydrogeologic characteristics of the aquifers is needed to prevent contamination of water supplies. The objectives of this project are:
1. to describe the hydrogeologic framework, areal extent, and regional flow system of selected aquifers that are major sources of drinking water supplies;
2. to quantify ground-water use and describe land use and population distribution; and

3. to assess the effects of present and potential problems of ground-water contamination from underground wastes.
These objectives will be accomplished by preparing hydrogeologic and geographic maps describing the aquifers and identifying potential problem areas. The atlas which is in preparation covers Puerto Rico and its offshore islands of Vieques, Culebra, and Mona; and the U.S. Virgin Islands of St. Croix, St. Thomas, and St. John.
The information in the atlas is organized by ground-water provinces: North-Coast Province, South-Coast Province, West-Coast Province, EastCoast Province, Puerto Rico Offshore Islands, and U.S. Virgin Islands. Some of these are divided into smaller areas that are described separately.

Date Project Began:

October 1984

Principal Investigator: Fernando Gomez-Gomez

The Regional Aquifer System Analysis (RASA) program represents a systematic effort by the Survey to study the Nation's major aquifer systems. The Caribbean Islands RASA project includes an area of more than 3,600 m2 within Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. The principal aquifers are the carbonate rocks of northern Puerto Rico, the carbonate rocks of central St. Croix, (Kingshill aquifer) and the alluvial deposits of the southern coastal plain in Puerto Rico.
In October 1984, the Survey began this 5-year study to: 1) describe the hydrogeology of the principal aquifers, (2) define the hydraulics of the principal ground-water flow systems, (3) define the geochemistry of each principal aquifer system and its relation to the mineral components within the geologic framework, (4) describe the original aquifer systems as they existed prior to development and analyze the changes which have led to their present conditions, (5) combine, in a regional analysis, the results of this and previous studies, and (6) provide the capabilities through which the effects of future changes on the ground-water-flow systems can be estimated.
Six reports have been released and several others have been approved for publication or are in preparation.

In 1988, efforts were directed toward locating the saline-freshwater mixing zone and in determining the interaction between streams and the aquifer in the study area. Preparation of the report summarizing the results of this study is underway.

An investigation of the present hydrologic conditions in the Santa Isabel-Juana Diaz area was conducted from 1984 to 1988. The study area extends from Rio Jueyes to Rio Jacaguas covering about 50 m . The PRDOA was concerned that inadequate management of the water resources in this area could diminish the ground-water supplies, cause subsequent shortages during droughts, and induce seawater-intrusion problems.

The North Coast Limestone Regional Aquifer System is the most important ground-water reservoir in Puerto Rico. It is composed of hydrogeologic units of Middle Tertiary age, and extends from Aguadilla in western Puerto Rico to Loiza in the east. A welldeveloped karst topography characterizes the outcrop areas of this predominantly carbonate aquifer system.
A study of the hydrogeology of the North Coast Limestone Regional Aquifer System was initiated in 1985. It was divided into two phases: (1) an exploratory drilling phase, which has been completed, and (2) the development of a series of digital groundwater flow models, currently in progress. Fifteen deep test holes that penetrated both the water table and deep artesian aquifers were drilled using a dual tube drilling method that allowed retrieval of continuous lithologic cores, measurement of head and hydraulic properties, collection of water samples, and collection of borehole geophysical logs. Studies of the age and environments of deposition of the rocks are being conducted by the Department of Geology at

the University of New Orleans using the lithologic cores obtained while drilling the deep test holes.
A preliminary hydrogeologic framework of this regional aquifer system has been outlined. The system is composed of three hydrogeologic units of regional extent: an uppermost water-table aquifer, a middle confining unit, and a deep artesian aquifer. These Units were delineated based on their confining and water yielding properties, as well as their considerable lateral continuity.
Important tasks that remain, besides the groundwater flow modeling effort, are the mineralogical analysis and estimates of the amount and distribution of porosity and permeability in the different hydrogeologic units, the characterization of the different lithologic units using geophysical data, and the demonstration of time equivalency between outcrop and downdip fades described from the test holes cores. This work is being conducted in a cooperative effort by the Survey and the University of New Orleans.

A two-dimensional ground-water flow model for the alluvial aquifer between Rio Seco and Rio Guamani, along the south coast of Puerto Rico, was calibrated using predevelopment (approximately 1910) water levels. The model was then used to simulate flow in the aquifer in 1986 and to assess the

effects of increased ground-water withdrawals of 3.6 ft3/s (2.2 Mgal/d). The model was also used to estimate the effects of dredging of the former Laguna Las Mareas during 1970. The investigation was completed in February 1987.

October 1985 Juan C. Puig PRASA and PRDNR

The objective of this three-year study was to define the occurrence, availability, and quality of ground water resources of the Caguas-Juncos alluvial valley. Field activities for the study, including the acquisition of basic hydrogeologic data, have been completed. A comprehensive well and water-use inventory in the area was conducted and ground-water levels are being monitored at four continuous recording stations and by monthly measurements at selected wells.
The Caguas-Juncos alluvial aquifer is an unconfined system with a strong stream-aquifer hydraulic connection. The transmissivity of the aquifer is relatively low, with estimate values ranging between 50 and 3,000 ft /d. Higher transmissivity values occur along river channels. The aquifer's physical dimensions were estimated from well logs and geophysical

surveys. Transmissivity was estimated from specific capacity data and slug tests. Seepage studies, in conjunction with saturation runs and ground-water level measurements, were helpful in defining the streamaquifer hydraulic connection. Finally, a network of surface and ground-water sites were monitored for physical, chemical, and biological water-quality characteristics.
A ground-water flow model of the western part of the alluvial aquifer system was developed and calibrated. Preliminary results of the ground-water flow model indicate that the amount of ground-water available from this alluvial aquifer may be substantially greater than the 3 Mgal/d withdrawn for public supply. A report documenting the results of this investigation is in preparation.

GROUND WATER SITE INVENTORY
April 1986 Philip Gonzalez
EQB

Hydrologic data collected during investigations conducted by the Survey provide valuable information that can be used for the management of water resources. Easy access to hydrologic data facilitates that management process.
The Ground-Water Site Inventory (GWSI) is part of the National Water Information System (NWIS) which is a data storage and retrieval system for hydrologic data collected by the Survey and its cooperators. The Ground-Water Site Inventory is an interactive system on the Survey's minicomputer. The GWSI provides a vehicle to update existing sites and enter new sites into the local data base and, at the same time, to update the national data storage and retrieval system. The GWSI also provides a vehicle to selectively retrieve and display, in several formats, ground- and surface-water data stored in the local data base.

The GWSI contains approximately 300 descriptive data elements containing information about sites where ground water data is collected. These data elements are stored in one general data file called the Site Fjle and eight GWSI data files. The Site File contains identification parameters, physical and political descriptions, and data-collection methods at the sit^s. The information in the Site File is available to all members of the NWIS. The eight GWSI data files contain information related to well-construction, ground-water levels, ground-water discharge, hydrogeology, observation wells, hydraulics, and water Use.
In tjie Caribbean District, GWSI has been functional fbr only a few years. During that period, more than 75 percent of the historic ground water data in the District (data for an estimated 4,000 to 4,500 wells and springs) has been entered into GWSI.

A geohydrologic investigation of potential sites for a hazardous-waste treatment, stabilization, and storage facility was conducted for the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico. The project is a three-year study. The principal sites under investigation are the Aguirre and Pozo Hondo areas located on the south coast of Puerto Rico. The objectives of the program are to define the geology and hydraulic characteristics of the aquifer underlying each site.
Accomplishments during the latter part of 1986 through 1987 included the completion of 33 test wells at 15 sites. These wells were shallow, generally less than 95 feet. Data collected from these wells were used to prepare preliminary potentiometric and subsurface geologic maps. To help define aquifer hydraulic characteristics, single well aquifer tests

were performed in each well. Also, during 1987, 12 continuous-recording ground-water stations and 2 continuous-recording surface-water stations were installed.
Work completed during 1988 included the drilling of 30 test wells at 19 sites. Using a dual-tube coring rig, continuous cores were collected from each well. Depth of drilling for these wells ranged between 28 to 210 feet. Water-quality data was collected from 19 of the test wells drilled. Single-well aquifer tests were completed at 19 of the test wells drilled.
Further plans for the project include multi-well aquifer tests to accurately define aquifer characteristics. For further definition of the subsurface geology, surface geophysical surveys will be completed.

Following the detection of volatile organic compounds in water withdrawn from wells tapping the Turpentine Run aquifer in St. Thomas, U.S. Virgin Islands, the Survey was requested by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to prepare a potentiometric map of the aquifer to define the direction of ground-water flow. The aquifer is comprised of fractured-volcanic rock overlain by alluvial deposits. The alluvial deposits can reach a thickness of 40 feet. Wells have been drilled into the fractured volcanics to depths of 325 feet. Ground water in the aquifer occurs under water-table conditions. To prepare the potentiometric map, ground-water levels were

measured in 32 wells on September 11, 1987. The altitude of water levels in these wells was referenced to known land surface altitude benchmarks. The potentiometric map was completed and published in 1988.

Juan C. Puig and Lourdes Rolon

Ground-water management can be defined as the process by which efficient ground-water development is achieved by optimizing well locations and withdrawals within the constraints of cost, water quality, water law, and the physical laws governing the ground-water system. A ground-water management model can be designed to interact with a groundwater flow model in order to incorporate the dynamics of the aquifer as system constraints.
The AQMAN3D aquifer management model is a modified version of the original AQMAN model proposed by Lefkoff and Gorelick (1987), which utilizes as its ground-water flow simulation subroutine the "Finite-Difference Model for Aquifer Simulation in Two Dimensions" by Trescott, Pinder, and Larson (1976). The modification consists in making the AQMAN model fully compatible with the MODULAR Three Dimensional Ground-Water Flow Model by McDonald and Harbaugh (1984).

Thej idea of coupling the AQMAN model with the MODULAR model arose because many groundwater systems need to be simulated in three-dimensions, and MODULAR is the model most commonly used by the Survey for this purpose. Additionally, many of the aquifer systems on the island have already been simulated using the MODULAR model.
The AQMAN3D model is being applied in the previously described ground-water resources investigation in the Caguas-Juncos valley. The model will be developed, tested, and verified and a report will be published.
The I use of aquifer management models is a relatively riew methodology in the science of hydrology. A reliable and accurate method for decision making is essential for water managers in areas where groundwater availability may be limited by water allocation conflicts or poor water quality.

October 1987

Principal Investigator: Vicente Quinones-Aponte

Cooperating Agency:

Aquifer recharge and stream base-flow conditions depend on the interaction between streams and adjacent, shallow aquifers. Base-flow conditions are sustained by an elevated water table in comparison to stream stage; aquifer recharge is sustained by elevated stream stage in comparison to the water table. This information is important in formulating water-supply management criteria for the aquifer or the stream.
Field work is being conducted in an effort to determine the ground-water/surface-water relations at two representative sites in the north- and south-coast aquifer systems. Part of the lower Rio Grande de Manati Valley is being studied as representative of the north coast stream-aquifer systems. The upper reach of the Rio Jacaguas alluvial valley in Juana Diaz is considered representative of the south coast stream-aquifer systems. The study in the Rio Grande

de Manati Valley is being conducted in conjunction with the Survey's Caribbean Islands Regional Aquifer-System Analysis project.
In the Juana Diaz area, continuous information on water levels in streams and wells was collected. Channel flow information was also obtained concurrently with streamflow data in Rio Jacaguas. A mass balance approach is being used to analyze the streamflow infiltration rates to the aquifer. In the Manati area, a network of nested observation wells was installed at three different locations within the valley. Analyses of water level fluctuations in wells is being compared with water level fluctuations in the river. A ground-water hydraulic approach is being used to analyze the surface/ground water interrelation and its significance to further ground-water development within the area. The data collection has been completed and a report is preparation.

INTER-AQUIFER WATER MOVEMENT WltHIN THE LIMESTONE AQUIFER, NORTH COAST OF PUERTO RICO

Date Project Began:

October 1987

Principal Investigators:

Angel Roman-Mas

and Carlos Conde-Costas

Cooperative Agencies:

PRIDCO, PRDNR, and PRASA

The objective of this investigation is to quantitatively demonstrate that the extraordinary decline in the potentiometric surface of the North Coast Artesian Aquifer is not the result of ground-water withdrawals through wells, but rather from interaquifer water movement through poorly grouted wells, corroded or ruptured casing, or improperly abandoned water wells. Artesian-well records and water-level information were compiled as part of the project. Pilot tests were conducted at artesian wells in two areas. Results of this investigation indicate that the principal cause of the water-level decline is leakage from the artesian aquifer into the water-table aquifer through damaged wells. Although the total amount of water being transferred is presently unknown, it is probably in excess of 10 Mgal/d. In addi-

tion, it is believed that each artesian well may represent a point of water transfer.
As part of this project all existing wells (operating and abandoned) that are screened in the artesian aquifer will be evaluated with respect to inter-aquifer transfer of water. The information gathered will define the areal extent of the inter-aquifer water movement and quantify the amount of water being transferred. This information can help well owners and water managers to reduce or minimize the water lost through leaky wells. Leaky wells can be sealed with clement grout and new production wells drilled. The information collected during this study can also guide decisions regarding drilling and screening of new production wells.

MANGANESE AND IRON CHEMISTRY IN THE VALLE DE YABUCOA ALLUVIAL AQUIFER, SOUTHEASTERN PUHRTO RICO

Date Project Began: Principal Investigators: Cooperating Agency:

October 1987 Joseph W. Troester
PRASA

Elevated concentrations of manganese and iron which produce an objectionable taste have been observed in the water of the Valle de Yabucoa alluvial aquifer in southeastern Puerto Rico. The alluvium in the valley is composed of rocks derived from the mineralized San Lorenzo batholith, which appears to be the source of the iron and manganese. Furthermore, the alluvium contains organic swamp deposits which may control the oxidation state of iron and manganese as well as other multivalent species.
The objectives of this study are (1) to determine the source of the iron and manganese as well as other multivalent ionic species in the Valle de Yabucoa alluvial aquifer, (2) to describe the chemical and

physical processes that control the behavior of iron and minganese, and (3) to determine the location of any sources of fresh ground water in the Valle de Yabucoa alluvial aquifer that are low in iron and manganese,
A complete well inventory in the Valle de Yabucoa was conducted. A comprehensive water-quality sampling program to document the extent of the problem is underway. Drill sites have been selected to test various chemical hypotheses for the origin of the iron and manganese concentrations and the controls upon their distribution in the ground water through space and time.

VERTICAL CONTINUUM OF AQUIFER COMPRESSIBILITY AND ITS RELATION TO SPECIFIC STORAGE

Date Project Began: Principal Investigator:
Cooperating Agency:

The purpose of this investigation is to study the range of specific storage values that can occur in an aquifer. Values of specific storage are usually assigned according to the degree of confinement of the aquifer. Artesian aquifers usually have values around 10 /ft while water table aquifers have values that usually range from 0.01 to 0.3/ft.
A laboratory model was constructed to measure the specific storage directly from a simulated aquifer. In this model a saturated aquifer material sample is maintained at a given hydrostatic pressure while subjected to a particular effective stress provided by a dead load which simulates the weight of overburden. By reducing the hydrostatic head in the pressure cylinder, a certain quantity of water is released by compression of the aquifer matrix and some "subsidence" of the aquifer can be measured. This quantity of wa^er represents the amount of compressional storage of the sample at the prevailing effective stress and hydrostatic pressure. By varying the effective

stress, measured values of specific storage for different simulated depths of burial can be obtained.
The knowledge of the pore volume compressibility of the aquifer material, the thickness of the aquifer, and the value of the specific storage at the bottom of the aquifer uniquely determine the specific storage profile used in the model. The effects of this depthdependent specific storage profile will be studied from the type-curves obtained from the model. A turning point in the type curves would support the hypothesis of the existence of vertical differences in specific storage since the hydraulic conductivity will be kept constant throughout the model runs.
A cross-sectional Galerkin finite element algorithm allowing a depth- dependent specific storage profile has been coded and tested for an artesian aquifer. The code was tested for the particular case of constant specific storage and the model results were compared with Theis' dimensionless analytical solutions.

WATER RESOURCES OF THE RIO MAJADA AND RIO LAPA ALLUVIAL VALLEYS, SOUTH COAST, PUERTO RICO

Date Project Began: Principal Investigator: Cooperating Agencies:

June 1988 Orlando Ramos-Gines PREQB, and CSHES

In 1986 the Puerto Rico Olympic Committee inaugurated the Albergue Olimpico, a training facility for athletes. Although water supply needs of the Albergue Olimpico are presently met from shallow aquifers in the Rio Majada alluvial valley, the development of new facilities will require additional water supplies. The purpose of this study is to determine if the alluvial aquifer in the water resources in the Rio Lapa valley can provide the additional water needed to satisfy future demands.

Efforts during the first year have been directed towards (1) updating the well inventory in the area, (2) construction of two real-time surface-water stations at Rio Majada and Rio Lapa, (3) establishment of four continuous ground-water stations, (4) definition of the areal distribution in thickness of the alluvial deposits in both valleys through seismic refraction surveys and test hole drilling, and (5) sampling of the major production wells in the Albergue Olimpico.

The Puerto Rico Water-Use information program was started in 1977 to place all available water-use information into a single usable format to meet the needs of Commonwealth and federal agencies. Reliable water-use information is needed by the Commonwealth agencies for the effective planning and management of the island's water resources. The objectives of the water-use program are to collect, analyze, and store water-use data and to disseminate water-use data for about 12 different water-use categories. Comprehensive reports documenting water use in Puerto Rico are available for 1980,198082, and 1984. Two additional reports, covering years 1984-85 and 1986-90 separately, are in preparation.

QUANTITATIVE ASSESSMENT OF LANDSLIDE HAZARDS IN THE RIO BLANCO, RIO CIBUCO AND RIO COAMO BASINS, PUERTO RICO

Date Project Began:

A three-year study of landslide potential in the Rio Blanco, Rio Cibuco and Rio Coamo basins is being conducted with the dual purpose of advising the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico on landslide potential in relation to existing and future development and creating maps showing a quantitative estimate of landslide hazard on the island. The multidisciplinary study will utilize techniques from the fields of geomorphology, soil mechanics, geophysics, ground-water hydraulics, botany, plant ecology, and climatology. The knowledge gained will be applicable to similar basins in Puerto Rico and will be the most extensive quantitative analysis to date, of landslide hazard on the island. Previous studies have been either broad and qualitative in nature or locally focused.
A key element of the project will be the measurement of shear strength of soil on slopes with the Iowa Borehole Shear Tester. This portable tool measures resistance to shear at depths of up to 30 ft, and generates data which will give both the angle of internal friction and soil cohesion. Seismic refraction methods are being utilized to assess the thickness of soil over bedrock.
In addition to written reports, one of the products of the investigation will be composite maps, using the Geographic Information System, showing slope stability, depth to and type of bedrock, slope angle and aspect, precipitation amount and intensity, and vegetation, as well as previous areas of slope failure.

Through this computer assisted overlay of various data types, relative risk ratings can be estimated for various areas within the study basins. The maps and a final written report will be produced in 1990, the last year of the project.

COMPUTER SECTION

The District's minicomputer was enhanced with the upgrade from a one million instructions per second (MIPS) unit to a five MIPS unit in 1988 allowing faster processing of hydrologic data. The upgrade included an interchange of the old 630 megabytes (MB) and 300MB disk drives for three new 773MB disks which are much smaller and about three times more efficient in access time. This equipment, combined with new computer graphics devices, including a digitizer, two graphic terminals, twenty interactive

terminals, and a workstation, support hydrologic investigations and the development of a new analytical tool called a Geographic Information System (GIS).
Data communication lines have been installed to provide three cooperating agencies, the PRDNR, PRASA, and the PREQB, access to the District's minicomputer. Other agencies including agencies from the U.S. Virgin Islands, have expressed interest in tying into the District's minicomputer and may be provided access in the future.

Almost all the agencies in the cooperator list

The development of a Geographic Information System (GIS) in the Caribbean District has been made possible by a combined effort between several Commonwealth agencies. An analytical tool such as GIS will help in hydrologic analysis and information processing for a wide variety of water-resources investigations. GIS will store attribute information tied to geographic locations or areas having different digitized layers or categories such as land use, topography, hydrography, transportation and other types of

spatially distributed data. It will also support complex hydrologic studies through its sophisticated capacity to overlay various information grids.
Much of the data requirements for GIS consist of geographic information which can be digitized from topographic maps. The maps for Puerto Rico are currently being digitized. When this task is completec}, the digitized data will be available to cooperating agencies.
