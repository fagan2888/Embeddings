GEOLOGY AND MINERAL DEPOSITS OF THE THOMAS AND DUGWAY RANGES, JUAB AND TOOELE COUNTIES, UTAH

By MoRTIMER H. STAATZ and WILFRED J. CARR

ABSTRACT

The area covered by this report includes nearly all the

Thomas and Dugway Ranges, two small ranges in the eastern

part of the Basin and Range province in western Juab and

Tooele Counties, Utah. . It includes all the Dugway Range

quadrangle and the northern one-third of the Topaz Mountain

quadrangle, an area of 306 square miles.

The units mapped may be grouped according to age and type

into sedimentary rocks of Paleozoic age, volcanic rocks and

associated s~dimentary rocks of Tertiary age, anc} Lake Bonne-

ville sediments and alluvium of Quaternary age.

Sedimentary rocks of Paleozoic age make up most of the

Dugway Range, Spor Mou~tain, the eastern part of the Black

Rock Hills, and the extreme southern end of the Thomas

Range. Twenty-six formations ranging in age from Early

Cambrian to Late Mississippian with a total thickness of more

than 30,000 feet were mapped in this area. Ten of these for-

mations· are here described for the first time.

The rocks of Cambrian age are thicker than those of any

other period, being at least 17,300 feet thick. At the base of

the Cambrian section is the Prospect Mountain quartzite,

which is at least 12,000 feet thick. The overlying Cambrian

rocks, most' of which are limestone and dolomite, consist of

the following nine formations: the· Cabin shale and the Busby

quartzite of Early Cambrian age, the Shadscale formation,

the Trailer limestone, and the Fandangle limestone of Middle

Cambrian age, the Lamb dolomite of Middle(?) and Late

Cambrian age, and the Straight Canyon formation, the Fera·

limestone, and the Dugway Ridge dolomite of Late Cambrian

age.

Rocks of known Ordovician age consist of three formations:

the Garden City formation, which is of Early Ordovician age

in its lower and· middle parts and of Middle Ordovician age

in its upper part, the Swan Peak formation of Middle Ordo-

vician age, and the Fish Haven dolomite of Late Ordovician

age. The Swan Peak formation consists of a lower shaly unit

and an upper massive quartzite unit; the other two Ordovician

formations are mainly carb.onate rocks.

·

Overlying the Fish Haven is the Floride dolomite, which is

either Ordovician or Silurian in age. This formation is over-

lain by four Middle Siluran dolomites: the Bell Hill dolomite,

the Harrisite dolomite, the Lost Sheep dolomite, and the

Thursday dolomite.

Rocks of. Devonian age, particularly Late Devonian, are

much thicker in the Thomas and Dugway Ranges than in sur-

rounding areas.· ·Although 4,000 feet of Upper Devonian rocks

is found in this ·area, not over 600 feet of rocks of this age

has been described from anywhere else in western Utah. The

following Devonian formations, which consist of dolomite,

quartzite, and minor limestone, have been mapped in the

Thomas and Dugway Ranges: the Sevy dolomite of Early(?) and Middle Devonian age ; tbe Engelmann formation of Middle and Late Devonian age; and the Goshoot formation, the Gilson dolomite, and the Hanauer formation of Late Devonian age. In addition, in the Black Rock Hills some rocks whose position within the Late Devonian is not known have. been mapped as Upper Devonian sedimentary rocks, undivided.
Rocks of Mississippian age are found only in the northern part of the Dugway Range and ·consist of the following three formations: the Madison limestone equivalent of Early Mis. sissippian age, and the Woodman formation and Ochre Mountain limestone of Late Mississippian age.
A thick sequence of rhyodacitic and rhyolitic rocks of Tertiary age, probably Miocene and Pliocene, occupies the southern part of the Dugway Range, almost all of the main part of the Thomas Range, and the western part of the Black Rock Hills. In addition, dikes and small intrusive plugs are common on Spor Mountain and in parts of the Dugway Range.
The volcanic rocks are divided into an older group and a younger group, separated by an unconformity. The older group is poorly exposed, and relations between various rock units in this group are not well known. The older group contains the following 10 rock units: rhyodacite; rhyodacite breccia and associated tuffs; plagioclase crystal .tuff; black glass-welded. tuff; sanidine crystal tuff; quartz-sanidine crystal tuff; vitric tuff; red vitric tuff, conglomerate, and sandstone; porphyritic rhyolite; and .intrusive breccia. ·The younger volcanic group consists of at least five overlapping rhyolitic subgroups, each made up from bottom to top of vitric tuff, breccia, and rhyolite; rhyolite makes up the great bulk of the rock. Cutting these three rock types is a green glass unit believed to represent rock formed in .or adjacent to vents. Three small sandstone units of variable composition are interbedded at different horizons iil the volcanics. The sandstone units were probably deposited in small lakes formed ~Y the damming of streams by the volcanic rocks.
The volcanic rocks of the Thomas and D1,1gway Ranges are poorer in ferromagnesian minerals and more salle than the average volcanic rock, and have an alkali-lime index of 61.6, which is similar to that of the rock sequences from Crater Lake and Paricutin volcano. The rocks of the older volcanic group have an average uranium content of 0.001 percent and the rocks of the younger· group have an average uranium content of 0.003 percent;.. the latter figure is three times that of the average rhyolitic rock in the western United States.
A unique assemblage of .minerals including topaz, garnet, beryl, bixbylte, pseudobrookite, arid specularite, occurs in the rhyolites of the younger group.
Lake Bonneville sediments, consisting chiefly of clay, marl, sand, and gravel, fill the basins on either side of the .Thomas

and Dugway Ranges up to an elevation of 5,200 feet. Tufa and tufa-cemented conglomerate are found along some of the old shorelines. Gravel bars as much as 50 feet high were formed across the mouths of canyons and off points of land in old Lake Bonneville. Alluvium is found in some of the valleys and it overlies the Lake Bonneville sediments.
The Paleozoic sedimentary rocks and the older group of volcanic rocks have a dominant northerly strike and westerly dip that averages about 35°. The only large-scale fold in this sequence of rocks is the gentle Buckhorn syncline in the northeastern part of the Dugway Range. Most of the areas of Paleozoic rocks, however, are complexly faulted. The faults may be divided, in general, into three groups, according to age and type : First, and oldest, are four small thrusts on Spor Mountain and adjacent Eagle Rock Ridge, which offset the beds a maximum of 1,000 feet vertically, and one large thruf't, the Buckhorn, in the northern part of the Dugway Range, which has a minimum stratigraphic displacement of 15,000 feet. Second is a group of diversely oriented normal and reverse faults with dip-slip movement of from a few inches to about 1,000 feet. These make up the great bulk of the faults. Third is a group of large north- or northwest-trending normal faults of the Basin and Range type. In general, these faults have a dip-slip movement of several thousand feet; they constitute the youngest group in the nrea and have elevated the ranges to their present height. Most of the movement on the first two groups of faults occurred prior to the emplacement of the volcanic rocks. The Basin and Range faults, however, cut rocks of the older volcanic group in places, but rarely those of the younger group. The volcanic rocks of the younger group are not tilted and are cut by only a few small faults with a maximum vertical displacement of about 100 feet.
Three types of ore deposits occur in the Thomas and Dugway Hanges: (1) uraniferous fiuorspar, (2) uranium, and (3) lead-zinc-copper-silver.
The uraniferous fluorspar bodies have been found only on Spor Mountain, where they occur as pipes, veins, and disseminated deposits. The pipes are the only important deposits; more than 99 percent of the fluorspar produced has come from them. These pipes are generally circular or oval in plan and range from less than a foot in diameter to 155 feet long by 106 feet wide. They plunge vertically or steeply to the east. The pipes occur in the Ordovician and Silurian dolomites that overlie the quartzite of the Swan Peak for.Qlation. Most of the ore replaced shattered rock in zones along faults or adjacent· to intrusive breccia bodies. The ore consists .of 60 to 95 percent fluorite intermixed with montmorillonite, quartz, chalcedony, calcite, and dolomite. The ore contains from 0.003 to 0.33 percent uranium, which occurs chiefly in the fluorite, although a little .carnotite is present near the surface in some deposits. The grade of the fluorite generally decreases with depth and as tlie gangue minerals, especially montmorillonite and chalcedony, increase. In some deposits uranium is secondarily enriched near the surface, the upper part of the ore body commonly containing twice as much uranium as the
lower part. This enrichment probably took place by slow leaching and downward concentration of uranium from the uppermost part of the ore body as it was progressively ex-
posed by erosion to weathering in an arid climate. The ura-
nium was redeposited in dry underlying ore a few inches to 30 feet below the position from which it was leached.
The fluorspar deposits are believed to have been formed by the reaction of .dolomite with fluorine-rich fluids containing

uranium which were derived from the magma that formed the younger volcanic group.
'The production of the Spor Mountain district from its beginning in 1944 through 1956 was 112,000 short tons of fluorspar containing 65 percent CaF2. Over 75 percent of this production can:ie from three properties: the Lgst Sheep, the Fluorine Queen, and the Bell Hill.
The uranium deposits occur on the east and west flanks of the Thomas Range at the southern· end of the main part of the range. They consist of two types: (1) veinlets in ~·hyolite and tuff ~tnd (2) disseminated minerals in tuffaceous sandstone and conglomerate. The first type consists of numerous veinlets inade up chiefly of opal. The uranium content of these :veinlets ranges from 0.009 to 0.026 percent; the small size and low grade of these deposits makes them of little economic importance. The second type of deposit, found only on the Good Will property, contains uranium in the rather rare mineral, weeksite, that replaces parts of limestone pebbles in a conglomerate, and in beta-uranophane that fills .voids in a porous tuffaceous sandstone. A number of abn.ormally radioactive areas occur in the sandstone. 'The largest of these is at least 120 feet long by 65 feet wide. Nine samples from this zone ranged from 0.012 to 0.65 percent uranium.
The only ore shipped from any of the uranium deposits came from the Good Will property, and from 1954 ·through 1956 amounted to 129 short tons containing from 0.11 to 0.25 percent uranium.
The lead-zinc-copper-silver deposits are found in the Dugway district in the north end of the Dugway Range. These deposits are small ; many ore bodies do not exceed 40 feet in length. About 60 percent of the production has come from the Four Metals mine, where the main vein is about 200 feet long and extends at least 300 feet down the dip. '.rhe deposits in this district are fissure veins in quartzite, and fissure veins and replacements in dolomite and limestone. Most ·are dominantly lead-zinc deposits that occur along minor faults; some of the deposits in the carbonate rocks adjacent to major northwest-trending faults, however, are dominantly of pyritic copper ore. The vein minerals consist chiefly of galena, sphalerite, pyrite, chalcopyrite, quartz, fluorite, and barite. In the upper parts of the veins the primary ore minerals have been largely oxidized, and on most properties this is the only ore that has been mined.
Although data are scarce for the period prior to 1934, the total production of the district through 1956 is estimated to be 12,000 short tons of ore containing on the average approximately 7.7 percent lead, 10.0 percent zinc, 0.07 percent copper, and 1.4 ounces per ton of silver.
INTRODUCTION
LOCATION, CULTURE, AND ACCESSIBILITY
The Thomas and Dugway Ranges are two small desert ranges in Juab and Tooele Counties, western Utah. The area mapped, the Dugway Range quadrangle and the northern third of the Topaz Mountain quachangle, includes most of both ranges. This area is bounded by parallels :39°40' and 40° and meridians 113° and 113°15' (fig. 1). The western boundary of the area is about 4;) miles east of the lJtahNevada State line and the eastern boundary is about

The Thomas and Dugway Ranges are approximately 100 miles west of the eastern boundary of the
"rBasin mid Range province, which in northern Utah is
defined by the western base of the asat~h Range (Nolan, 1943, p. 142). Between the Thomas and Dugway Ranges and this boundary are the 1\::eg, Simpson, Sheeprock,. East Tintic, and Lake Ranges, and the intetvening basins. The Thomas and Dugway R.anges form tllf~ eentral part of a long north-trending uplift, which consists from north to south of (1) GraJ1ite Mountain, (2) Dugway Range, (3) Thomas R.ange, and (4). Drum Mountains. Granite Mountn.in is separated from the Dugway R.ange by a flat about 3 miles wide. Dugway Range is arbitrarily divided from the Thomas Range at Dugway Pass, and the Thomas Range is arbitrarily divided from the Drum l\iountains by the Jericho-Callao or Sand Pass road. .,Vest of the Dugway and Thomas Ranges lies Fish Springs Flat which separates these ranges from the north-trending Fish Springs R.ange. East of the
'iVThomas and Dugway Ranges lies another flat, whose·
central part is occupied by Pismire ash. This flat sepn.rates these ranges fro~n the north-trending I<::eg ~'fountains. Both flats drain northward toward the Great Salt Lake Desert, which lies just north of the Dugway R.ange.

The Thomas Range consists of three topographically separate units. The main or eastern part trends north and is shaped like an hourglass. This part of the range is about 14 miles long and has a maximum width of 9 miles at its northern end. The western i)art, which is called Spor Mountain, is separated from the main part of the Thomas Range by The Dell, a valley 0.8 to 2 miles wide. Spor Mountain trends north-northwest and is oval shaped, being 5.5 miles long and as much as 2.5 miles wide.

Spor Mountain. The Black Rock Hills are circular and 4.5 miles in diameter.
The mountains of the Thomas and the Dugway· Ranges exhibit two distinct types of topography (pl. 1). The main or eastern part of the Thomas Range, which is made up of flat-lying volcanic rocks, is a rolling uplanq from 6,400 to 6,800 feet in elevation that appears to represent in many places the. slightly modified original top of the lava flows. It is bounded by steep escarpments and is .cut by steepsided canyons. Spor Mountain, the Black Rock Hills, and the Dugway Range, which are made up predominantly of northwest-dipping sedimentary rocks of Paleozoic age, are characterized by rugged topography, a steep eastern face, and a more gentle western slope.
The highest peak in the two ranges rises to 7,112 feet and lies near the east edge of the main part of the Thomas Range. This part of the Thomas Range is the highest of the four mountain blocks, having three main peaks over 7,000 feet high and 17 peaks over 6,500 feet. The highest peak in the Dugway Range has an elevation of 6,830 feet and is just west of the head of Fandang1e Canyon in the central part of the range. Only six peaks in the Dugway Range

The climate of the Dugway and Thomas Ranges, in common with much of the rest of the Basin and Range province, is arid. •
There are no weather stations in these two ranges, but a comparison can be made. with stations in similar terrain in the surrounding country. A compilation of records from weather stations at Deset·et, 32 miles to the southeast; Dugway, 15 miles to the northeast; Eureka, 46 miles to the east; and Partoun, 40 miles to the west, is given in t~ble 1.
Pronounced temperature differences between day and night are characteristic of this area. During July and August the daily temperature may· range from more than 100°F to 60°F or less. The lowest temperature recorded in the region was -32°F at Deseret il1 1V32 and 1937; the highest was 106°F, at Delta in 1V43.
Because the Thomas and Dugway Ranges have a higher elevation than any of the towns except Eureka, they probably receive more rain and snow. Precipitation is greatest along the ridges, which commonly receive moisture from small storms that do not. reach the surrounding flats. Snow storms may occur

I:Iigh winds are common in the area from l\1arch to June and in November and December.
WATER SUPPLY
No permanent strea.ms flow in either the Dug,\ray
or the Thomas Range. ';yater is found in the stream
'beds only after heavy rains or during warm periods following a snow storm. Most water for human us-
age is hauled from the nen.rest town. ';yater for sheep
that graze in the area from November to April is obtained from snow, reservoirs, wells, and springs.
In favorable areas the U.S. Grazing Service has made low earth dams across the washes to pond the water from sud¢len rainfalls. Two such reservoirs, the Bittner !(noll Reservoir, which lies about 11/2 miles east of Dugway Pass, and the East Topaz No. 2 Reservoir, which lies 31/2\ miles east of the central part of the Thomas Range, are in the area under study. A third reservoir is located beside the JerichoCallao road about 2 miles east of the junction with. the road to Delta.
Four wells have been drilled by the U.S. Bureau of Land l\1anagement on the flats along main routes of sheep travel. These wells are: (1) Fandangle well near the north end of the Dugway Range opposite the mouth of Fandangle Canyon, (2) Fer'a No. 38 well about 1%, miles east of the central part of the Dugway Range, (3) Dugway-Topaz well on the south side of the Vernon-Callao road, 4.1 miles east of the top of Dugway Pass, and (4) Fera well No. 28 on Fish Springs Flat 1.2 miles north of the VernonCallao road.
Data on the depth and water level in these wells were compiled by C. T. Snyder of the U.S. Geological Survey and are given in table 2. All the wells are

in unconsolidated Lake Bonneville sediments in which a number of gravel beds are present. The water level under the flats surrounding the Dugway Range is quite uniform· (table 2) ; it varies only 24 ·feet in the four wells, whose surface elevations vary 131 feet.
The only analysis of well water available is from Fera well No. 28, which contains 5,022 ppm (parts per million) of dissolved material, of which 3,663 ppm correspond. to NaCl. The water from all four wells is probably saline, however, because it has migrated through the Lake Bonneville sediments, which are high in evaporites.

J. E. Palmer, range manager for the Bureau of Land Management (1955, oral communication), re- . ported the water from the Dugway-Topaz Well to be warm, and estimated its temperature at about 120°F. Hot springs along the east foot of the Fish Springs Range, 18 miles to the west, have the same position relative to that mountain front as the Dugway-Topaz well has to the east face of the Dugway Range. The springs along the east side of the Fish Springs Range were cited ·by Bryan (1919, p. 533-535) as a classic example of fissure springs whose water is heated in the deeper and warmer parts of the earth. The warm water from the Dugway-Topaz well may be similar in nature; it represents water which has risen along a

in the western part of the Dugway Range. Folding is unimportant, although there is one gentle syncline in the northeastern part of the Dugway Range. Three general groups of faults can be distinguished: (1) thL'ust faults, which are few in number and are the oldest, (2) normal and reverse faults of diverse trends, which are numerous and generally of small displacement, and (3) north- and northwest-trending Basin n.nd Range faults, which n.re large and probably the youngest.
SUMMARY OF GEOLOGIC HISTORY
.The ge~logic history o.f the sedimentation, volm~nic activity, structure, and ore deposits of the Thomas and Dugway Ranges is discussed in greater detail in

the sections on these subjects; only a brief summary of the major geologic events is given here.
The oldest rocks exposed in the area belong to the Prospect Mountain quartzite ·of Early Cambrian age, but rocks of Precambrian age may be included in this formation. The great thickness of this formation (12,000 feet) and the presence of ripple marks, raindrop prints, and crossbedding suggest that the sediments were deposited in a shallow but rapidly sinking basin. Sediments similar to those · deposited throughout Prospect Mountain time ·formed the Cabin shale and Busby quartzite in late Early Cambrian time.
An abrupt change to a carbonate facies began in :Middle Cambrian time and carbonate deposition continued virtually uninterrupted until Middle Ordovician time. During this iuterval a thick sequence of limestone and some dolomite layers were formed. Some of the beds were laid down in. shallow water, as indicated by the intraformational limestone conglomerate beds in the Fandangle limestone and particularly in the Garden City formation.
During Middle Ordovician time, clay, silt, and sand were deposited to form the Swan Peak formation. Between the time the S'vai.1 Peak formation was laid down and the end of Middle Devonian, another thick sequence of carbonate rocks was deposited; these rocks are chiefly detrital dolomite and are commonly crossbedded. The dolomite is believed to have formed from limestone sand that was reworked in shallow water prior to consolidation.
The Upper Devonian rocks, which are mainly dolomite and dolomite interbedded. with quartzite, are commonly crossbedded and many times thicker than rocks of similar age in adjoining regions. This suggests that the original sediments were deposited in a
small, rapidly sinking basin. During Mississippian time limestone, some siltstone,
and some dolomit~ were deposited. Uplift and erosion occurred after the deposition of
these rocks. Regional compression probably in Cretaceous or early Tertiary time formed the small Buckhorn syncline and several thrust faults. There followed a period of uplift· and tension, ·during which
hundreds of diversely oriented normal faults were formed.
The older group of volcanic rocks was emplaced, probably in Miocene time beginning with intrusion of rhyodacite and followed by extrusion of porphyritic rhyolite and various kinds of welded tuffs. Basin and Range faulting may have begun during the later part
of this volcanic episode.

Cambrian sedimentary rocks are ·well exposed in

the Dugway Range and were first mentioned by Gil-

bert (1875, p. 27), who crossed them at Dugway Pass.

He found· no fossils, but, because of stratigraphic

similarities to rocks elsewhere in the Great Basin,

believed these rocks to be Silurian. A brief descrip-

tion of part of the sequence in the Dugway mining

district was given by B. S. Butler (Butler, Loughlin,

Heikes, and others, 1920, p. 460). Although quartz-

ite and carbonate rocks of Cambrian age are present

in this complexly faulted mining district, the only

fossils found by Butler were Mississippian in age. A

reconnaissance map of west-central Utah compiled by

the Intermountain Association of Petroleum Geolo-

gists (1951, pl. 2) indicates the Dugway Range to be

made up of Ordovician and Silurian sedimentary

rocks.

·

Cambrian rocks make up about 70 percent of the

sedimentary sequence in the Dugway Range and form

all of its steep east front. Cambrian rocks crop out

also in large areas on the western side of Fandangle

Canyon and along the main divide in the north-central

part of the range. A small patch of Upper Cambrian

roeks is exposed at the south end of the Thomas

forms much of the Pioche, Cabin, and Ophir formations. Fossils indicate that the upper parts of these formations are of different ages. . Above the lower shale unit only a few minor shale beds· are found in the Gold Hill district, the East Tintic Mountains, and the Stockton and Fairfield quadrangles. Conspicuous shale-bearing units, however, are found stratigraphically higher il1 other areas: Chisholm shale (early Middle Cambrian) in the Pioche district ('iVestgate and Knopf, 1932, p. 11) ; the 'Vheeler formation (middle Middle Cambrian), and Orr formation (early Late Cambrian) in the House Range ('¥alcott, 1908, p. 176-177, 191); the Secret Canyon shale (late Middle Cambrian) and Dunderberg shale (Late Cambrian) in the Eureka district (Nolan, Merriam, and Williams, 1956, p. 16, 19) ; and the Lincoln.

Most of the exposures of the Prospect Mountain quartzite iu- the mapped area are in the Dugway Range, where it forms steep-sided ridges as much as 1,200 feet high in the northwest part of the· range (pl. 1 and fig. 48). Quartzite also crops out in an area of more than a mile square in the northeast corner of the Dugway Range, and small hills of quartzite occur along the east side of the Dugway Range · between Shadscale Canyon and a point 1 mile north of. Trailer Wash. Although· the Prospect Mountain quartzite is not found in the Thomas Range, it crops out on several knolls to the northeast.
Lithology.-The Prospect Mountain quartzite is composed chiefly of white or tan massive quartzite, but it also contains purplish-red quartzite, quartz pebble conglomerate, shale, and siltstone.
The sequence of lithologic units, many of which are lenslike, varies from one fault block to another. No complete sequence exists within the mapped area, and the base of the formation is not exposed.
The part of the Prospect Mountain quartzite believed to be the oldest exposed in the area crops out on two mountains in the northeastern part of th.e Dugway Range just east of Fandangle Canyon (fig. 4). On the larger mountain to the north (block A), eight units were mappeg. These are shown on figure 4. The lithology of the units is as follows, beginning with the oldest: (1) medium-bedded gray quartzite with interbedded greenish-brown quartzitic shales, (2) white to tan thick-bedded quartizte, (3) olive-green quartzitic micaceous shale and shaly quartzite interbedded with gray-green thick- to
medium-bedded·. medium- to fine-grained quartzite, (4) massive white fine-grained quartzite, (5) olivegreen fissile shale with 1- to 4-foot interbeds of dark
brown-weathering quartzite, (6) massive light-gray to brownish-green quartz pebble conglomerate with spherical to ellipsoidal pebbles, which range from 1j8 to 11/2 inches in diameter and make up from less than 1 to 75 percent of the rock, (7) slaty sericitic shale, which is olive-drab in the lower part and green in the
upper part, capped by 10 to 20 feet of dark purplishred thin-bedded sericitic siltstone, and (8) coarsegrained crossbedded violet hematitic quartzite with numerous lenses of conglomerate. Conglomeratic beds
of unit 8 contain numerous quartz and red jasper pebbles.

On the smaller mountain (block B, fig. 4) to the south, three units were mapped: (1) 1- to 2-foot beds of hematitic brown and white fine- to n1edium-grained quartzite interlayered '\Vith about 25 percent drab olive-brown quartzitic shale in 1- to 6-inch beds, (2) vitreous white to light-gray and brown, massive fineto coarse-grained quartzite, and (3) medium-bedded gray quartzite interbedded with greenish-brown quartzitic shales. Unit 3 in block B probably correlates with unit 1 in block A.
The largest area underlain by Prospect Mountain
quartzite is ir1 the northwestern Dugway Range (fig.
5). In this region near Cannon Canyon and northwest of it the formation consists mainly of 4,500 feet of thick- to massive-bedded, locally crossbedded, generally fine-grained white quartzite. In some places a few lenses of coarse quartz and jasper sand and small pebbles are present. Similar quartzite forms the two ridges northeast of Kellys Hole.
The irregular fault block in the southern part of the Kellys Hole area contains the following four units from oldest to youngest, as shown on figure 5 : (1) olive-green and greenish-brown micaceous siltstone and minor shale interbedded with quartzite, (2) dark hematitic red medium- to coarse-grained quartzite that weathers very dark brown and contains a few beds of green siltstone, (3) dark-green micaceous siltstone like that in unit 1, ·which also contains a few beds of dark-red quartzite, and (4) brownish fine-grained micaceous quartzite.
Thickness.-Rough measurements from maps indicate that nearly 12,000 feet of Prospect Mountain quartzite is exposed in the Dugway Range, but the occurrence of various lithologic units in blocks isolated by faults ·makes any compilation of thickness somewhat tenuous.
The base of the Prospect Mountain quartzite was not recognized in the Dugway Range,. but the top is exposed on the southeast side of the range and on a hill 2,000 feet southeast of the mouth of Cannon Canyon in the northwestern part of the range. In both areas only· a few hundred feet of quartzite is exposed.
The thickness of the exposed Prospect. Mountain quartzite was approximated by totaling the various units in the fault blocks. The thicknesses of the following general units or ·groups of units are given in their probable order from youngest to oldest : (1) 200+ feet of white, tan, and reddish brown quartzite (exposed beneath the Cabin shale in the southeast and northwest (pl. 1) corners of the Dugway Range), (2) 1,000+ feet of siltstone and red and brown quartzite (southern part of the Kellys Hole area, fig. ·5) ;

lower contacts of the Busby quartzite are exposed in

a single section is on the low-lying ridge 0.7 mile

north of Trailer Wash where the thickness of 160

feet was measured. (See preceding stratigraphic sec-

tion.) This section approximates the 180 feet recorded

m the Drum 1\iountains, but is much less than the

430 to 450 feet recorded by Nolan (1935, p. 8) in the

type section in the northern part of the Deep Creek

Range.

Age and correlation.-No fossils have· been found

in the Busby quartzite or in the underlying forma-

tions in the Dugway Range. A small trilobite cra-

nid:ium, similar to that of Onchocephalus depTessus

Rasetti, was found 137 feet above the top of the

Busby quartzite in the Shadscale formation. This

fossil has been dated by A. R. Palmer as probably

1\iiddle Cambrian, although some similar forms oc-

curred in Early Cambrian time.

The Busby quartzite in the Dugway Range· is very

similar lithologically to the section in the Gold Hill

district (Nolan, 1935, p. 8) even though the latter is

much thicker. Moreover, iri both areas the lowermost

unit of the overlying carbonate rocks is a thin cream-

colored orange-weatherii1g dolomite. No unconformi-

ties either above or below the Busby ,quartzite are

noted in either region. Nolan (1935, p. 8) found no

identifiable fossils in the Busby quartzite in the Gold

l-Iill district, but, because this unit was deposited in a

shallow water environment, he favored a Middle

rather than an Early Cambrian age. In the Gold

The Shadscale formation is here named from exposures near Shadscale Canyon which is near the southern end of the Dugway Range. This formation c:ops ·out in only a few places, generally on low-lying ridges where the formation is incompletely exposed. The largest area of outcrop is a discontinuous band 1.3 miles long, extending northward from Shadscale Canyon along the east side of the Dugway Range (pl. 1). The type section was measured in this outcrop area along a low ridge, 0.6 mile north of Trailer Wash. The Shadscale formation crops out at four other localities: ( 1) in several small patches 1.2 miles east of Dugway Pass, (2) in a band along the west side of the south end of Fandangle Canyon,. (3) along a ridge 1.4 miles south-southeast of the Four Metals mine, and (4) in several patches on the west side of the Dugway Range west of the south end of Kellys Hole.
Lithology.-The lower one-fourth of the Shadscale
formation consists of about 60 feet of dolomite over-
lain by about 70. feet of siltstone; the upper threefourths is gray limestone interbedded with green shale. The bottom of the formation is marked by a distinctive unit of orange-brown-weathering dolomite which overlies the dark-green siltstone -of the Busby quartzite. The upper boundary of the formation is placed at the top of the highest shale bed. Most commonly this upper shale is covered, and the upper contact is placed at the base of the massive gray limestone that marks the bottom of the Trailer limestone.
The lowest' beds of the Shadscale formation are cream-colored dolomite which weathers deep orange brown. These strata usually form a ledge between
partly covered slopes. In places the dolomite con-

Similar fossiliferous horizons, although apparently with ·different species, are found in the lower part of the Abercrombie formation· in the Gold I-Iill district, and in the lower part of the SwaSey formation in the I-Iouse Range." A Middle Cambrian age is thus indicated for most of this formation, although it is possible that the lowermost part may be late Early Cambrian in age.
The sequence of limestone and shale~ in the Shadscale formation corresponds closely with that ~f dolomite A, limestones B, C;. D, and E, and shales 1, 2, 3, 4; and 5 in the Drum Mountains (Crittenden, Straczek, and Roberts, 1961, p. 499-501) (fig. 3), and there is littJe doubt that th~y are correlatives. Glossople'uTa is found in shale 4 in. the Drum Mountains. The stratigraphy of the Shadscale .also corresponds fn.irly closely with the lower two-thirds of the Abercrombie formation in the Gold Hill area (Nolan, 1935, p. 8-9) which also has a cream-colored orangeweathering · dolomite bed at th·e base~ The corresponding units of the Abercrombie formation are somewhat thicker than those of the Shadscale formation. The presence of GlossopleuTa in the Pole Canyon limestone in the Snake Range (Drewes and Palmer, 1957, p. 112) indicates that the Shadscale formation is equivalent in age to at least part of this formation. The Shadscaie formation is also equivalent to all or part of the following formations: the Lyndon limestone and the Chisholm shale of the Pioche district (Westgate and I<:nopf, 1932, p. 10-11) and the Eldorado dolomite of the Eureka district
(Nolan, Merriam, and Williams, 1956, p. 9-11)
(figs. 2 and 3).
TRAILER LIMESTONE (MIDDLE CAMBRIAN)
The Trailer limestone is here named from exposures in Trailer Wash in the southeastern · part of the Dugway Range. This formation is best exposed in a .series of low-lying hills from Shadscale Canyon to a point· approximately 1 mile north of Trailer
'Vash (pl. 1). Although the section is complete on both sides of Trailer Wash, the type section was measured along a narrow ridge 0.6 mile north of the wash because of better exposures. The Trailer limestone also crops out at five other places.: (1) a
few small knolls along the east side of the Dugway Range just north of Straight Canyon, (2) several

knolls about 1 mile east of Dugway Pass, (3) in a band on the west side of. the south end .of Fandangle Canyon, (4) on a ridge at the south end of Bullion Canyon, and (5) along two hillsides 1.4 miles southsoutheast of the Four Metals mine.
Lithology.-The Trailer limestone consists of bluegray limestone and shaly limestone. The base of· the Trailer limestone is marked by a massive gray limestone, w.hich forms a small cliff rising above the covered slope underlain by shale at the top of the Shadscale formation. The upper boundary of the Trailer limestone is · placed at the base of the massive cliff 'formed by the resistant gray limestone in the lower part of the Fandangle limestone. ·
The lower 150 feet of the Trailer limestone is a massive to thick-bedded dark blue-gray limestone with
a few GiTvanella near the base, and is locally cut
by stringers of white calcite. The upper part of the ~railer limestone is dark
blue-gray, ·very fine grained limestone. The beds are ¥.t, to 2 inches thick and are separated by tan or yellow. argillaceous partings. In weathered surfaces the· rock is somewhat lighter gray than on fresh surfaces. As a rule the beds are poorly exposed. Cylin-
drical structural features, possibly worm-holes, 14 to
12j inch in diameter and as much as 11/2 inches deep are found in the middle part of this unit. In plan view, the cylindrical features consist of a central core or depression surrounded by one or more concentric rings which .weather in relief. These· features are commonly· perpendicular to the bedding and are filled with a slightly coarser grained, dark-gray ..limestone.
· Locally, the weathered surfaces of bedding planes in the upper part of the Trailer limestone have a crinkled appearance. Another feature of this thinbedded limestone. is the presence in some places of either single or clustered small dark-brown . cubes of limonite, pseudomorphous after pyrite. These cubes were also noted by the authors· in equivalent units in the House Range (Wheeler formation) and in the upper part of the Abercrombie formation in the Deep Creek Range. In the Dugway Range none of the cubes found in the Trailer exceeded lj8 inch in width, but those in the House Range are as much as
¥.t, inch wide. Insoluble ·residue analysis of thin-bedded limestone
of the Trailer yielded 10.7 percent insoluble material, of which about 90 percent. was clay-size and 10 percent sand-size.· The clay-size material was very dark gray, owing to the presence of finely. divided organic
material.

Thickness.-Two sections of the Trailer limestone were measured on low ridges on the east side of the Dugway Range, 0.6 and 0.3 mile north of Trailer Wash. These measurements were 384 and 470 feet, respectively. The rather large difference between these two measurements, only 0.3 mile apart, suggests that one of the sections may be faulted. A rough map measurement (pl. 1) of the thickness of the Trailer limestone east of Dugway Pass suggests that in this vicinity it is almost 380 feet thick. Equivalent units in the Drum Mountains, 22 miles to the south, are · over 600 feet thick (Crittenden, Straczek, and Roberts, 1961, p. 502).
Age and correlation.-A few fossils were found in the upper thin-bedded part of the Trailer limestone. These include numer~us worm tubes ( ~) and scattered tribolite fragments. A. R. Palmer (1955, written communication) stated, "Trilobites from the four collections sent us are not well preserved; however, the tails and heads seem to conform · to the characteristics of Elrathia kingii (Meek) . This species is a characteristic form of the Middle Cambrian Wheeler formation in the House Range and has also been recorded from collections by Max Crittenden from the Drum Mountains.". The position of the Trailer above the Middle Cambrian Shadscale formation and approximately 2,450 feet below the early Late Cambrian fossils in the upper part of the Lamb dolomite a~d the presence in its upper part of a trilo-

bite which closely resembles Elrathia kingii point to ward a Middle Cambrian age for the Trailer limestone.
The Wheeler formation in the House Range resembles the Trailer limestone in that it contains thinbedded dark-gray limestone but differs in containing large amounts of shale. The Trailer limestone correlates with limestone F and most of limestone G of Crittenden, Straczek, and Roberts (1961, p. 502) in the Drum Mountains.
Similar strata consisting of both a lower massive limestone and an upper thin-bedded limestone occur in the upper part of the Abercrombie formation in the Gold Hill district, but these strata are two to three times as thick as the corresponding units In the Dugway Range. The thin-bedded limestone in the Gold Hill district also contains worm trails and the trilobite Elrathia sp. (Nolan, 1935, p. 10). Thus, the Trailer limestone can be correlated with the upper part of the Abercrombie formation with considerable confidence.
Correlatives of the Trailer limestone in other regions are more uncertain. The Trailer is beljeved equivalent in part to the Herkimer limestone of the Tintic district (see fig.· 2), which is correlated by Morris and Lovering (1961, p. 35) with the upper part of the Abercrombie formation. Inasmuch as the Herkimer limestone lacks fossils, this correlation is based on its stratigraphic position and lithologic similarity (for example, presence of shale bed). Other tentative correlations of the Trailer limestone are made with the Geddes limestone in the Eureka district (fig. 2), the lower part of the Highland Peak limestone in the Pioche district, upper part of the Pole Canyon limestone in the southern Snake Range, the Bowman limestone in the Stockton and Fairfield quadrangles (fig. 3), and at least part of the Maxfield limestone of the Cottonwood-American Fork area (Calkins and Butler, 1943, p. 14-19).
FANDANGLE LIMESTONE (MIDDLE CAMBRIAN)
The Fandangle limestone is here named from outcrops near Fandangle Canyon in the north-central part of the Dugway Range, where it forms a wide band along the west side of this valley for approximately 3.5 miles. A second prominent outcrop extends for 7.2 miles along the east side of the Dugway Range from a point 0.3 mile south of Dugway Pass to the large canyon 1.5 miles north of Fera Canyon. The type section was measured just north of Straight Canyon in the latter area because the section in Fandangle Canyon is partially dolomitized and the upper and lower contacts are not exposed in the same

fault block. A third exposu.re extends 2.6 miles southeastward from the head of Bullion Canyon.
Lithology.-The Fandangle limestone is characterized by m~lssive beds, a medium blue-gr.ay color, and in the upper part interbeds of distinctive laminated light-gray limestone that weathers white, pink, or yellow. The base of the formation is marked by a prominent cliff of massive gray limestone above partly covered slopes underlain by the thin-bedded Trailer limestone. At the top of the Fandangle limestone is a unit of thin-bedded gray limestone containing a few beds of ii~traformational conglomerate. ·Because this unit is commonly covered, the top of the formatiQn is placed at the base of the massive cliff-forming Girvanella-bearing (fig. 6) limestone or dolomite that marks the base of the Lamb dolomite.
Approximately the lower two-thirds of the formation consists of rather uniform blue-gray fine-grained massive- to medium-bedded limestone which locally has silty partings or contains a little brown chert. Some beds are mottled light and dark, and some are oolitic. The massive beds form cliffs in most areas.
About 1,100 feet above the base of the formation occur interbeds and zones of light-gray fine-grained laminated limestone that .weathers white· to various shades of pink and tan. Similar beds are found at intervals nearly to the top of the formation.
At the top of the Fandangle limestone is a zone about 20 feet thick, commonly represented by a covered slope, of thin-bedded gray limestone with tubeor wormlike markings on some bedding planes and
thin lenses of flat-pebble intraformational conglomerate. A few feet of an olive-green fissile shale was
also noted near the top of the formation in the type section. Detailed stratigraphy of this formation at its type section is given below.

numerous beds containing Girvanella (fig. 6) ranging from 1;B to % inch in diameter. These algae commonly show a concentric structure. In most places a cliff-forming unit of massive dark-gray limestone or dolomite as much as 40 feet thick, with abundant Girvanella, is present at the base of the formation. Locally this unit may be much thinner or even absent, and in some places is represented by tan dolomite; but in mapping, the Girvanella zone was found to be a rather reliable marker of the base of the formation. The thin-bedded limestone at the top of the underlying Fandangle limestone usually forms a covered slope beneath this massive unit.
A thin section of a specimen of gray tan-weathering dolomite in the Girvanella zone collected in the central part of the Dugway Range shows a rock made up almost entirely of a mosaic of anhedral to euhedral dolomite crystals averaging. about .05 mm across. About 40 percent of 'the slide consists of nearly circular areas about 0.7 mm in diameter, each composed of a dolomite crystal surrounded by a thin ring of dusky fine-grained carbonate, possibly calcite. In hand specimen, small dark, closely spaced grains of dolomite surrounded by shallow pits in the lighter tan matrix give the weathered surface of the rock a."pepper and salt" texture. These grains, the circular areas seen in thin section, are probably small altered Girvanella.
Above the zone in which Girvanella are common, there is typically about 450 feet of massive light- to dark-gray sandy-textured dolomite with a few thin zones of thin-bedded fine-grained gray dolomite or limestone.

The upper 250 feet of the formation is commonly stained red and can be easily distinguished from a distance. In most places this zone is predominantly gray to pinkish-gray thin-bedded flaggy limestone containing local thin quartzite layers. Bedding planes commonly are stained reddish brown. A few beds, particularly toward the bottom of the zone, are of thin- and massive-bedded medium-grained pink or tan dolomite; in one place there are a few small intraformational conglomerate layers. In the upper part of the zone, quartz sand becomes more abundant, and at the top of the formation are two units 5 to 15 f~et thick of thin-bedded red-brown calcareous quartzite separated by about 5 feet of gray, commonly b~ow~­ weathering thin-bedded limestone. The quartzite IS micaceous in places and commonly has fucoidlike tubes on the bedding planes. In some places there are concentric reddish bands of iron-stain. A thin section of the quartzite contained about 65 percent of very fine to fine-oTained angular well-sorted quartz sand
0.
in a calcareous cement, mostly calcite. Bent muscovite flakes between the quartz grains made up about 3 percent of the slide. An insoluble residue analysis of a similar specimen yielded 54 percent fine-grained quartz sand.
The Lamb dolomite varies considerably in lithology along strike because the rock is extensively dolomitized. Beds which in places are entirely tan dolomite may show an abrupt lateral change to almost unaltered gray limestone (fig. 16). The basal Girvanella zone is dolomite in one place, limestone in another. Dolomitization also extended irregularly across the upper part of the formation into the Straight Canyon formation. Like the dolomite in the Fandan()'le limestone, the dolomitized part of the

Age and correlation.-Although the algae Girvanella sp. are extremely common in the Lamb dolomite, the occurrence of this fossil throughout the Paleozoic section and its widespread occurrence in the Cambrian in the eastern ·part of the Great Basin province make it of little aid in specific dating. Other fossils are rare in the Lamb dolomite, but some with curved trian~lar-shaped cross sections were collected 128 feet above the base of the formation. These were examined by A. R. Palmer (1955," written com-
munciation) who stated that they are "* * * cross-
sections ol objects that may be Hyolithes. Almost identical-appearing samples have been collected from near the top of the Lynch dolomite in the Ophir district; however, a correlation with the Lynch dolomite should only be suggested if it. appears probable on other grounds." Inasmuch as the Lynch dolomite is Middle ( ~) and Late Cambrian and these Hyolithes ( ~) come from near its top, the lower part of the Lamb is probably of Late Cambrian age.
Fragmentary remains of other fossils were collected 800 feet above the base of the formation 6,100 feet northeast· of Dugway Pass. These were identified by A. R. Palmer (1955, written communication) as Hyolithes sp., Semicircularia sp., and Kinsabia sp.
According to Palmer, these fossils are early Late Cambrian (Dresbach) in age. Fossils in the overlying Straight Canyon formation are also of early Late Cambrian age.

STRAIGHT CANYON FORMATION (UPPER CAMBRIAN)
The Straight Canyon formation is here named from outcrops near Straight Canyon on the ea!5t-central side of the Dugway Range. The type section was measured along the ridge 1 mile south of Straight Canyon. This formation is well exposed along the east side of the Dugway Range from Dugway Pass to the large canyon 1.5 miles north of Fera Canyon. It is also exposed in a discontinuous band 1 to 2 miles west of the south end of Fandangle Canyon and on several knolls about 1 mile southeast of Dugway Pass.
Lithology.-The Straight Canyon formation consists chiefly of gray and pinkish-gray limestone and some tan-weathering gray dolomite. The lower contact of the formation is at the bottom of the first gray limestone or dolomite bed above the reddish-brown quartzite that marks the top of the Lamb dolomite. The upper contact is at the top of a zone of yellow or red limestone and dolomite and at the ·base of the first massive white limestone bed of the Fera limestone.
The lower two-thirds to three-fourths of the formation is medium-grained gray to dark~gray thin- to medium-bedded limestone that is locally mottled light and dark in streaks parallel to the bedding. Some of these beds are sandy textured or have reddish ·brown sandy patches on the bedding. planes. Nodular irregular bedding is common 1in this interval.
The upper third to one-quarter of the formation consists of massive gray medium-grained dolomite that generally weathers tan, and black to gray finegrained thin- to thick-bedded limestone locally stained red or light yellow on bedding planes. At the top of the formation is a 15- to 20-foot zone of yellow, pink, and reddish-brown fine-grained limestone and dolomite. Locally the uppermost bed is a distinctive purplish-gray or orange dolomite commonly with dark red-brown irregular mottles more or ·less parallel to bedding. The weathered surface of this rock is purplish tan with streaks of very fine quartz sand.
Like the underlying Lamb dolomite, the Straight Canyon formation has been subjected to all degrees of dolomitization. Commonly dolomite extends irreg-
712-190 0-64--3

ularly upward from the Lamb into the lower part of the Straight Canyon and in some places the formation is entirely dolomite. Where the rock has been altered to dolomite, primary structures, particularly bedding, are commonly obliterated. Dolomite occurs as irregular islands in limestone, and limestone as irregular islands in dolomite. Islands of dolomite in limestone are well exposed about 1 mile northeast of Dugway Pass (fig. 17). Apparently some of the mottling in limestone there and elsewhere represents an initial or incipient stage of dolomitization in which the gray limestone becomes tan and dolomitic in appearance, but. still gives moderate effervescence with dilute hydrochloric acid. A stratigraphic section through one of the least dolomitized areas is given below.

28 GEOLOGY AND MINERAL DEPOSITS, THOMAS AND DUGWAY RANGES, UTAH

on a ridge 1 mile south of Straight Canyon, and 360 feet thick on the ridge north of Straight Canyon.
Age and correlation.-The Straight Canyon formation has been dolomitized or partially dolomitized in most places, and fossils are ·found only in those places where the limestone is unaltered. A. R. Palmer examined and identified the fossils collected from the formation and indicated that they are early Late Cambrian in age.
The gastropod S emicircularea sp. was found about 5 feet above the base of the formation at one place in the southern part of the Dugway Range. Trilobites are fairly. common from this point to about 175 feet above the base of the formation, and the following types were identified :
Orepicephalus sp. Llanoaspis sp. Blountia sp. · Ooosella sp. Deiracephalus cf. D. aster (Walcott) M eteoraspis sp. Tricrepicephalus sp. Ooosina sp.
Palmer (1955, written communication) stated that "the trilobites in these collections are characteristic of the Orepicephalus zone of early Late Cambrian age, and fossils of similar age have been collected from the Opex formation in the Tintic district and the Weeks and lower Orr formations in the House Range."
The trilobite Aphelaspis sp. was found 300 feet above the base of the formation. Palmer (1955, written communication) stated that, "this trilobite is characteristic of the Aphelaspis zone at the top of the early Late Cambrian. It has been collected from the upper part of the Opex dolomite in the Tintic district, and from the middle of the Hicks formation in the Gold Hill district."
The Straight Canyon formation is thicker bedded, coarser grained, and darker colored than the Opex formation. The base of the Straight Canyon formation is probably younger than the lower 100 to 200 feet of the Opex in the East Tintic Mountains, and the top few feet of the Straight Canyon is probably younger than the top of the Opex.
The Straight Canyon formation resembles the Hicks formation of the Gold Hill district only in that both
overlie the red quartzitic beds that mark the upper-
most part of the Lamb dolomite. They differ in that
the Hicks formation is approximately four times as
thick, consists mainly of dolomite, and includes equiv-
alents of part or all of the Fera limestone and perhaps part of the overlying Dugway Ridge dolomite.

The Straight Canyon formation corresponds to dolomite Q in the Drum Mountains (Crittenden, Straczek, and Roberts, 1961, p. 502).
This formation is also equivalent, at least in part, to the Hamburg dolomite of the Eureka district (fig. 2), the Mendha limestone of the Pioche district (fig. 3), and the St. Charles limestone (Deiss, 1938, p. 1123-1124) of northern lJtah.
FERA LIMESTONE (UPPER CAMBRIAN)
The Fera limestone, here named from its occurrence at Fera Canyon, crops out in a continuous band along the east side of the Dugway Range from a point 0.1 mile north of Dugway Pass to the valley 1.5 miles north of Fera Canyon. The type section is on the prominent ridge 1 mile south of Straight Canyon. The Fera limestone is also found (1) as prominent outcrops in a discontinuous band. about 1.5 miles west of the southern part of Fandangle Canyon, (2) in a few small scattered outcrops a little over 1 mile southeast of Dugway Pass, and (3) in a narrow band trending northward from the north end of Green Grass Valley to the south end of Fandang1e Canyon.
Lithology.-In general, the lower three-fourths of the Fera limestone consists of very light gray to pink locally mottled limestone and minor tan dolomite, and the upper one-fourth of thin-bedded banded gray limestone. The base of the formation is marked by 30 feet of massive white limestone; the top of the formation is the top of the highest banded limestone beneath massive Dugway Ridge dolomite.
At the base of the formation is about 120 feet of light-gray or pink to nearly white, fine- to mediumgrained thick-bedded limestone that locally contains stylolites. Above these beds are about 90 to 140 feet of light-gray to gray and pink limestone and a few zones of tan dolomite. Near the center a few feet of a laminated fissile light-green shale commonly is present.
The upper part of the Fera limestone, about 100 feet thick, is thin- to medium-bedded fine-grained gray limestone with yellow, pink, and tan clayey partings. This unit contains numerous trilobites and brachiopods. Outcrops are distinguished by their slabby "flagstone" character and the "ribbon" appearance due to the light-colored partings. Locally the top 25 feet consists of gray fine-grained dolomite, but the thin beds serve to separate it from the overlying massive gray dolomite of the Dugway Ridge dolomite. The uppermost of these beds at places are finely laminated calcitic dolomite with some pink. or purplish gray staining. The type section of the Fera limestone is given below.

Thickness.-The thickness of the Fera limestone was measured at three places along the east side of the Dugway Range, where the formation is best exposed. It is between 365 and 395 feet thick on a ridge 1.3 miles north-northeast of Dugway Pass, where the top of the Fera limestone is partly covered, 400 feet thick on a ridge 1 mile south of Straight Canyon, and 280 feet thick on the ridge that forms the north side of Straight Canyon. The thin northernmost section is only a mile from the thickest section; this may be explained by the presence of (1) a strike fault, (2) a regional unconformity, or (3)· a facies change. The area north of Straight Canyon is well exposed and contains few faults, and no signs of an unconformity
were noted; thus, the difference in thickness appears
most likely to be due to a local facies change. Age and oorrelation.-Fossils are abundant in some
parts of the Fera limestone and indicate that its age ranges from early Late Cambrian to middle Late
Cambrian. The lowest fossils found in the Fera limestone came from a coarse-grained medium-gray

limestone bed, 84 feet above the base of the formation. These fossils were identified by A. R. Palmer (1955, written communication) as Paterina sp. and linguloid brachiopods. Palmer stated, "Paterina is a rather distinctive genus of phosphatic brachiopods that is not known at present to range above beds of late Dresbach (early Late Cambrian) age. However, the range of small phosphatic brachiopods such as these is still poorly known, and I would not like to exclude the possibility that this collection could be early Franconia (earliest medial Late Cambrian) in age." Some Girvanella sp. occur ~n a few places above the Paterilna sp., but this alga is found throughout the Cambrian rocks in the Dugway Range. Fossils are most common in a fine-grained thin-bedded medium-gray limestone unit with grayish-yellow and pink silty partings, which occurs between 307. and 375 feet above the base of the formation. Fossils are generally so common in this unit throughout the Dugway Range that it is easily recognizable and highly useful as a marker .bed. The following fossils were identified by Palmer from six collections from this unit in the upper part of the formation:
Conaspid trilobites Brachiopods :
BilZingseZZa sp. Eoorthis sp. Conodonts
Palmer (1955, written communication) stated, "These six collections all seem to contain the same fauna. This is of medial Late Cambrian (Franconia) age. E oorthis has been collected from beds that are 30 feet below the Emerald marker and about 60 feet from the base of the Ajax dolomite in the Tintic dis~ trict." At the time Palmer examined these collections, no conodonts had been described from the Cambrian. Later, however, Muller (1956, p. 1336) examined the fossil material in these collections, as well as similar ones from other districts. He believed that they contain true conodonts.
Rocks of the same age as the Fera limestone occur between Red Pine Mountain and Lookout Pass in the Sheeprock Range, 40 miles east of the Dugway Range. These rocks are chiefly thin-bedded shaly limestone. Fossils collected from them by Robert Cohenour and identified by Palmer contain both the brachiopod Billingsella sp. and conodonts ( ~) similar to those found in the Dugway Range. Both Billingsella sp. and E oorthis sp. have been reported from the St.
Charles limestone in Blacksmith Fork in northern Utah (Walcott, 1908, p. 192-19.3) ; Billingsella sp. also has been noted in the unnamed limestone that overlie~
the Corset Springs shale in the southern Snake Range,

Nevada (Drewes and Palmer, 1957, p. 116); Eoorthi8 sp. has been found in the Notch Peak limestone in the House Range (vValcott, 1908, p. 175). The Fera limestone is also equivalent in part to the Mendha limestone of the Pioche district (fig. 3) and to basal limestone of the Windfall formation of the Eureka district, Nevada (fig. 2).

and trilobite fragments. Above the limestone is about 110 feet of gray and minor brown sandy, locally mottled dolomite. This dolomite commonly contains gray chert nodules and, near the top, a few chert layers less than an inch thick.
-A detailed section of the Dugway Ridge dolomite at its well-exposed type section is given below.

DUGWAY RIDGE DOLOMITE (UPPER CAMBRIAN)
The Dugway Ridge dolomite is. here named from exposures on Dugway Ridge, which forms the crest of the Dugway· Range along its east side. The type section is along the south side of Straight Canyon, where this canyon cuts across Dugway Ridge. The Dugway Ridge dolomite crops out in a band that extends discontinuously from a _point 0.8 mile north of Dugway Pass to the large canyon 1.5 miles north of Fera Canyon. Other outcrops are on the west side of the south end of Fandangle Canyon and in a wide northward-trending band lying to the west of Fandangle Canyon.
Lithology.-The base of the Dugway Ridge dolomite is placed at the top of the thin-bedded dark-gray limestone of the upper part of the Fera limestone, and its top is the top of the uppermost dolomite bed below the thin-bedded gray limestone of the Ordovician Garden City formation.
The Dugway Ridge dolomite is largely massive resistant medium- to coarse-grained sandy-textured dolomite, which is difficult to subdivide lithologically. In general, the lower half tends to be light gray and tan, the lower part of the upper half light and dark gray, and the -upper part chiefly dark to medium gray. Some of the rock is color banded. Approximately 140 feet above the base and 135 feet below the top are zones containing conspicuous elliptical-shaped algae, Girvanella (fig. 6), in medium-grained gray sandytextured dolomite. Dark-gray to black dolomite, some of which contains lenses and stringers of gray chert, is common in the upper part of this formation.
Along the east side of the Dugway Range an 11foot thick fine-grained massive limestone bed with a little thin-bedded limestone at its base is found approxinlately 110 feet from the top of the formation. This unit, which was not found elsewhere, locally contains gray chert nodules. A thin section of the limestone shows that it consists of about 70 percent calcite grains, which are mostly less than 0.06 mm across, and about 25 percent clay-size material which occurs in layers that have a sharp contact on one side and that grade into the calcite on the other. Much of the calcite is fossil debris consisting of curved shell

ing St. Charles formations was not defined by Richardson, but Williams noted that thick dark-gray dolomite beds occur as prominent stratigraphic markers at the top of the St. Charles; Williams placed the base of the Garden City formation at the base of the lowest limestone beds above the thick gray dolomite (Williams, 1948, p. 1135). This boundary was followed by Ross (1951, p. 6) in his study of the stratigraphy of the Garden. City formation in northeastern Utah.
The Garden City formation is exposed in three areas · in the Thomas Range and in five areas in the Dugway
Range: (1) low hills at the extreme south end of the Thomas Ra;nge, south of Topaz Mountain, (2) hills 1.2 miles south of the south end of Spor Mountain, (3) a small area on the east side of Spor Mountain just west of the south end of Eagle Rock Ridge, (4) for 5 miles along th.e east sides of Green Grass Valley and Fandangle Canyon, (5) several patches at the southwest extremity of Fandangle Canyon, (6) in the canyon just south of peak 6830 in the center part of the Dugway Range, (7) a large area that surrounds Castle Mountain on the west side of the Dugway Range, and (8) a large area just south of Kellys Hole on the west side of the Dugway Range. The Garden City formation is also found in several neighboring

ranges, being present in the northern part of the Drum Mountains and Fish Springs Range.
Lithology.-The base of the Garden City formation is placed at the top of the highest dolomite in the underlying Dugway Ridge dolomite. The top of the Garden City is at the base of the brown calcareous shale and interbedded hematitic red limestone of the shale member of the Swan Peak formation. The limestone below this contact is gray.
The Garden City formation is quite distinctive and is made up largely of gray fine-grained limestone that characteristically weathers to very light shades of purple, green, and pink. This colored limestone is not found in any other formation in the area, except in a thin interval in the Cambrian Fera limestone. The Fera, however, does not contain the numerous intraformational conglomerates characteristic of the Garden City.
Subsidiary lithologic features make it possible, for the purposes of discussion, to divide the Garden City formation into two parts. Approximately the lower three-fourths of the formation is thin-bedded gray limestone characterized by numerous beds of intraformational conglomerate. The upper one-fourth is thin-bedded nodular gray limestone and tan- and pink-

The lower part of the Garden City formation is very fine grained medium- to light-gray thin-bedded limestone. I:t:J. places these beds weather pinkish gray or have a greenish cast. Much of this unit is made up of intraformational conglomerate beds (fig. 8)

ogy in the Thomas Range is like that in the Dugway Range, except that more chert and greenish-gray shale beds are present.
The Garden City formation is dolomitized on the west side of the Dugway Range south of Kellys Hole. In this area much of the limestone is converted to a sandy-textured dark-gray dolomite, which, except for the presence of scattered patches of typical Garden City limestone, is difficult, if not impossible, to distinguish from the Dugway Ridge dolomite.
Two samples of limestone from the middle and upper parts of the Garden City formation south of Spor Mountain contained 96 and 95 percent calcite in the carbonate fractions (table 5).

The upper part o:f the Garden City formation is characterized by abundant fossils, by a greater proportion of brownish-gray limestone, and by thin shale beds. Conglomerate beds' are scarce. The lower part o:f this upper unit is medium- to coarse-grained gray limestone with some shaly beds and numerous trilobite :fragments. Many of the trilobites and other fossils are silicified and may be recovered by dissolving the limestone in acid.

_Thiakness.-The Garden City formation is one of the thickest but most poorly exposed formations in the Dugway and Thomas Ranges. This formation generally underlies partially covered low hills and dip slopes of the steeper ridges. In spite of its widespread. occurrences, the entire formation is well exposed only at the head of Straight Canyon, where it forms the steep divide between Straight Canyon and Fandangle Canyon. Along the ridge on the south side of Straight Canyon, the Garden City formation is 1725 feet thick.
Age and coTrelation.-Numerous fossils are found in the Garden City formation. Fossils collected at five localities in the Dugway Range, four localities in the southern Thomas Range, and one locality in the northeasternmost Drum Mountains were identified by R. J. Ross, Jr., of the U.S. Geological Survey and are given in table 6. The collections from most of the localities represent relatively small stratigraphic intervals, but the collection from locality 1 represents most of the stratigraphic section of the Garden City formation just south of Straight Canyon, and the collection from locality 6 represents half of the section 11/2 miles

south of Spor Mountain. The stratigraphic position of the fossils collected at locality 1 is given on pages 33-34 of this report, and of the fossils collected at locality 6 on pages 10 and 11 of the report on the Thomas Range fluorspar district (Staatz and Osterwald, 1959) .
The great bulk of the Garden City formation is Early Ordovician in age; the Lower OrdovicianMiddle Ordovician boundary is in the upper part of the formation. The entire sequence is conformable.
Ross (1951) studied the Garden City in its type area· in the Randolph quadrangle in northeastern Utah; he distinguished 12 faunal zones there, which he labeled A to L. In collections from the Dugway and Thomas Ranges, Ross recognized faunal sequences belonging to the B, C, G, H, J, !{, and L zones. He (1951, p. 31-32) pointed out that the Lower Ordovician-Middle Ordovician boundary falls somewhere between the l{ and L zones, or below the lowest occurrence of the brachiopod Anornalorthis and probably above the highest occurrence of the brachiopod H esperonomia. In the Dugway Range this boundary is somewhere in the interval between 180 and 340 feet below. the top of the formation.
The lowest clearly identifiable fossils, (Symphyswritna cf. S. woosteri Ulrich and Bellefontia~ sp.), are found 52 feet above the base of the Garden City formation; they are Early Ordovician in age and belong to faunal zone B of Ross. Late Cambrian trilobite fragments are found 114 feet below the Garden City formation in the Dugway Ridge formation. It is possible, therefore, that some of the lower 52 feet of the Garden City formation is Late Cambrian in age or that some of the top 114 feet of the Dugway Ridge formation is Early Ordovician.
The Garden City formation correlates closely with . the lower and middle .parts of the Pogonip group of eastern Nevada and western Millard County, Utah. Hintze (1951, 1952) made a faunal study of this . group in· western Utah and eastern Nevada. He found 15 faunal zones and labeled them so as to correspond as nearly as possible with Ross' faunal zones. Ross' zone A was not recognized, and in addition to Ross' zones B through L, Hintze recognized faunal zones M, N, and 0 in the Pogonip group. Zone M is present in the lower part of the Swan Peak formation; the two higher faunal zones (N and 0) have not been recognized in northeastern Utah.· Because numerous fossils mark Ross' faunal zones A through L and Hintze's zones B through L, the different parts of the Garden City can be correlated with comparable parts of the Pogonip group with considerable certainty. The lithology of both formations is similar

36 GEOLOGY AND MINERAL DEPOSITS, THOMAS AND DUGWAY RANGES, UTAH

in that both consist principally of fine-grained light-

gray limestone. The Garden City formation also re-

sembles the Pogonip group in the southern part of

the Confusion Range (Ibex area) of western Millard

County, Utah, in that both are almost entirely thin

bedded and contain numerous intraformational con-

glomerate beds (Hintze, 1951, p. 30-63). Farther west,

however, in the Eureka district, Nevada, only the cen-

tral part (Ninemile formation) of the Pogonip group

is dominantly thin bedded, and no intraformational

conglomerate beds are mentioned (Nolan, Merriam,

and Williams, 1956, p. 23-29).

The writers have used the name Garden City rather

than Pogonip in the Thomas and Dugway Ranges

for the following reasons: (1) The upper part of the

Pogonip group, which correlates with the lower part

of the Swan Peak formation, is dominantly thick-

bedded gray limestone (Nolan, Merriam, and Williams,

1956, p. 28-29) in the Eureka district, 30 miles north-

west of the type section, but equivalent beds in the

Thomas and Dugway Ranges are mainly shale. (2)

Hintze (1951, p. 11-20) was able to divide the Pogonip

group into six formations in the Confusion Range,

and Nolan, Merriam, and Williams (1956, p..23-24)

divided the group into three formations in the Eureka

district; except for Hintze's Kanosh shale, which is

equivalent to the lower part of the Swan Peak for-

mation, none of these formations is mappable in the

Thomas and Dugway Ranges. In the Thomas and

Dugway Ranges the difficulty in recognizing equiva-

lents to the subdivisions of the Pogonip may be due

in part to poor exposures, but mostly it is due to the

similarity of the lithology throughout this area. (3)

R. J. Ross, Jr., who examined the Lower Ordovician

sedimentary rocks in the Thomas Range, stated (1952,

oral communication) that they are lithologically al-

most identical to the Garden City formation in its type

area in northeast Utah.

The Garden City formation in the Thomas and Dug-

way Ranges can be correlated to the east with the

Opohonga limestone in the East Tintic Mountains,

where Morris and Lovering (1961, p. 55-56) reported

fossil collections equivalent to faunal zones from B

through J in the Garden City formation. Inasmuch

as an unconformity separates the Opohonga limestone

from the overlying Fish Haven dolomite, the Opohonga

as originally laid down may have been equivalent to

the entire Garden City formation.

·

Nolan (1935, p. 15) has called the Chokecherry

dolomite to the west in the Gold Hill district Lower

Ordovician on the basis of the gastropod Scaevogyra ~

sp. collected near the base of the formation. A. R.

Palmer (1956, oral communication) believed this fossil

to be Late Cambrian in age. Later Kenneth F. Bick in a letter to R. J. Ross, Jr., dated October 22, 1956, reported collecting the Lower Ordovician graptolite Phyllograptus typus Hall from the upper part of the Chokecherry dolomite in the Deep Creek Mountains. Hence, the upper part of the Chokecherry correlates with at least part of the Garden City.
The Garden City formation probably also correlates with the Yellow Hill limestone and the lower part of the Tank Hill limestone in the Pioche district (Westgate and Knopf, 1932, p. 14-15) and with part of the Grampian limestone in the San Francisco district (Butler, 1913, p. 28-31).
SWAN PEAK FORMATION (MIDDLE ORDOVICIAN)
The Swan Peak formation, originally called the Swan Peak quartzite, was named by Richardson (1913, p. 409) from its occurrence on Swan Peak in northern Utah. Williams (1948, p. 1136), who studied the Logan quadrangle, pointed out that the Swan Peak contained not only the massive quartzite described by Richardson, but also underlying beds of shale interbedded with quartzite and limestone. Ross (1951, p. 10) stated that "the appearance of the type section is misleading and the lower half is masked by rusty-colored silty, sandy, and badly weathered quartzite rubble." He (1951, p. 10, 13) noted that 3 miles west-northwest of the type section a good exposure on the side of a small gorge shows massive quartzite overlying shale interbedded with quartzite and limestone. Thus, the Swan Peak formation at its type section actually consists of an upper massive quartzite member and a lower shaly member containing interbeds of quartzite in its upper part and limestone in its lower part.
The Swan Peak formation· is exposed at the following places in the area mapped: (1) in the low hills 1.2 miles south of the south end of Spor Mountain," (2) in a number of bands along the. east side of Spor Mountain, (3) in a north-trending band from the north end of Green Grass Valley into Fandangle Canyon, (4) in several areas on and to the west of Castle Mountain, and (5) in several areas on the west side of the Dugway Range about 11/2 miles southeast of 1\:ellys. Hole. The Swan Peak formation is also exposed 10 miles west of the area mapped in the northern part of the Fish Springs Range.
Lithology.-The Swan Peak formation is composed of two distinct units: a· lower third to one-half of brownish-green shale interbedded with thin beds of limestone, quartzite, and a little dolomite, and an up-
per part of thick- to massive-bedded white quartzite. The lithology of the shaly unit varies considerably

GENERAL GEOLOGY

37

from place to place, and much of this interval is commonly covered by slope wash. The overlying quartzite, however, is quite unifonn and resistant and is generally well exposed in steep cliffs (fig. 7). The base of the Swan Peak forntation is marked by the first shale bed above the limestone of the Garden City formation, and the top is the contact between the quartzite and the lowest dolomite bed of the Fish Haven dolomite.
The lower beds of the Swan Peak formation are brownish green to green, somewhat lumpy fissile shale that is commonly stained hematitic red on fractures and bedding planes. Locally they contain some small pieces of chert. Interbedded at irr~gular intervals are units from less than 1 inch to 5 feet thick of thinbedded coarse-grained gray to ·brownish-gray limestone. Several of these beds consist almost entirely of brachiopods. Dolomite or dolomitic limestone beds are common near the middle of the shaly member of the Swan Peak formation. These beds are generally red, hematitic, and from 0.1 to about 2.5 feet thick. Toward the top of the middle part of the shale unit they contain some quartz sand. Above this dolomitic zone only quartzite beds are found interbedded with the shale. The quartzite is generally fine grained and
brick red to brown or gray, and occurs in beds V2 inch
to 3 feet thick. This rock commonly has fucoids on the' undersides of its bedding planes.
A 6-inch banded bed of brown quartzitic phosphorite was noted just below the top of the shaly unit at one locality in the upper part of Fandangle Canyon. Black carbonaceous or phosphatic material was observed in this interval at a few other localities, and other phosphate beds may be present but concealed. A thin section of the phosphorite showed it to be composed of medium- to coarse-grained quartz sand (about 45 percent) cemented by wavy, banded, and streaked colloform collophmie (about 50 percent) , and brown limonite (about 4 percent) .
The upper part of the Swan Peak formation is composed entirely of fine- to medium-grained quartzite in beds which range from 1 to 10 feet thick, but are generally 2 to 4 feet thick. The quartzite is predominantly white, but locally it may be pink. On fracture surfaces it commonly weathers brown, and crossbedding is common locally. The quartz sand is generally well sorted and subangular to subround. Minor orthoclase and biotite have been noted at some localities, and traces of heavy minerals such as tourmaline and zircon are present. The quartzite is highly resistant and generally forms steep cliffs.
In the Dugway Range the contact between quartzite of the Swan Peak formation and dolomite of the

Fish Haven dolomite is locally transitional through a

zone 1 to 10 feet thick, apparently as a result of sec-

ondary silicification or dolomitization. The transi-

tional i·ock is tan arenaceous dolomite or dolomitic

quartzite, which may grade laterally within a few

feet into gray dolomite on the one hand and pure

vitreous quartzite on the other. One thin section of

the transitional rock showed what appeared to be

minor replacement of some of the quartz sand grains

by dolomite. The weathered surface of this rock is

covered in places by a thin coating of brown chert.

Thickness.-The entire Swan Peak formation is

exposed in only a few places and the whole forma-

tion was measured only ·on the southeast side of Cas-

tle l\1ountain where it is 470 feet thick. The lower

and upper members of the formation were measured

separately in a number of places. The lower shaly

member was measured : (1) just west of the south

end of Eagle Rock Ridge on the east side of Spor

Mountain, (2) at the southwest corner of the area

mapped in sec. 23, T. 13 S., R. 12 W., (3) on the

ridge forming the divide between Straight Canyon

and ·Fandangle Canyon, and (4) on the southeast

slope of Castle Mountain.· The thickness of the shale

member at these four localities is 250, 390, 290, and

265 feet, respectively. At the last locality the upper

contact between the shale member and the overlying

quartzite member is covered and the shale member

may be a little thinner than the thickness given.

Variations in the thickness of this member may be

due to differences in local sedimentation. Individual

beds within the shale unit also vary in thickness;

quartzite and carbonate beds cannot be correlated in

sections only a mile apart.

·

The upper massive quartzite meml?er was measured:

(1) 800 feet northeast of the Floride mine on Spor

Mountain, (2) on the southeast slope of Castle l\1oun-

tain, and (3) along the we~t side of the valley 2.1

miles southeast of the southern end of J(ellys Hole.

The thickness of the quartzite member at these three

localities is 590, 205, and 175 feet, respectively. A

thinning of at least 385 feet occurs between the cen-

tral part of Spor l\1ountain and the central part of

the Dugway Range, 15Jj2 miles to the north. A similar northward thinning was noted in the northern

Fish Springs Range, where in 1Jj2 miles the quartzite member of the Swan Peak formation thinned from

115 to 60 feet. The comparative thicknesses of the

quartzite in the Thomas and Dugway Ranges and in

the Fish Springs Range also indicates westward thin-

ning of this unit.

Age and correlation.-No fossils have been found

in the upper quartzite member of the Swan Peak for-

mation. In the underlying shale member, however, some beds are composed almost completely of brachiopods. Although fossils are abundant, especially in the lower and middle parts of the shaly unit, they consist chiefly of two genera of brachiopods and less commonly of several genera of trilobites in the lower part of the unit. Receptaculites and a few unidentified bryozoans and ostracodes have also been found at some localities. All our fossils from this formation were identified by R. J. Ross, Jr. In the lowest bed of the Swan Peak formation, 11j2 miles south of Spor Mountain the follo'Ying suite of fossils was found:
Orthambonites cf. 0. subalata (Ulrich and Cooper) Anomalorthis sp. Trilobite cf. Pseudomera barrandi (Billings)
Ross stated (1952, written communication) that this collection is probably of early Chazyan age (early Middle Ordovician) and the fauna is the same as that in the uppermost beds of the Garden City formation.
Fossils were collected above this lowest bed at a number of localities on both Spor Mou,ntain and the Dugway Range. The most complete collection (U.S. Geol. Survey colln. D358£0) came from the south side of Castle Mountain, 25 to 50. feet above the base of the ,formation, and contained the following fossils:

A complete list of the identified fossils from the Swan Peak formation in the mapped area was compiled from U.S. Geol. Survey collections D358£0, D355£0, D356£0, D357£0, D317m, D317n, D317o, D317p and is given below :
Orthambonites sp. michaelis (Clark) cf. 0. michaelis (Clark) cf. 0. occidentalis Cooper cf. 0. sublata (Ulrich and Cooper) cf. 0. eucharis (Ulrich and Cooper) swanensis (Ulrich and Cooper)
Anomalorthis sp. utahensis Ulrich and Cooper cf. A. utahensis Ulrich and Cooper aff. A. lonensis (Walcott) cf. A. lonensis (Walcott)

These fossils all indicate an early Middle Ordovician age for the lower part of the Swan Peak formation.

The quartzite and shale members of this formation correlate stratigraphically, and the shale member paleontologically, with the Swan Peak formation at its type locality in northeastern Utah. Ross (1952, oral communication), after visiting Spor Mountain, stated that the Middle Ordovician rocks in that area are similar in lithology to those of the Swan Peak formation he had studied in the type area. Ross (1951, p. 27) found both Orthambonites' michaelis (Clark) and Anomalorthis sp. in the lower part of the Swan Peak formation in the Logan quadrangle in northeastern Utah.
The lower part of the Swan Peak formation correlates closely with part of the upper part of the Pogonip group in the Ibex area of the Confusion Range (Hintze, 1951, p. 30-68). Hintze divided the Pogonip group in this region into six formations: House limestone, Fillmore limestone, Wahwah limestone, Juab limestone, J(anosh shale, and Lehman formation. The first four correlate with the Garden City formation and the Kanosh shale with the lower part of the Swan Peak formation; the Lehman formation apparently has no recognized equivalent in this part of l!tah. Lithologically Hintze's Kanosh shale in the Confusion Range resembles the lower part of the Swan Peak formation; both contain the same suite of fossils. Overlying the Lehman in the Confusion Range is an interbedded series containing sandstone, limestone, dolomite, and shale which Hintze (1951, p. 20-21) and vVebb (1956,p. 11-12) believed to be Swan Peak quartzite. On top of this is a dolomite called the Crystal Peak dolomite by Webb ( 1~56, p. 12-13), which in turn is overlain by the Eureka quartzite. The Crystal Peak dolomite of Webb has been reported 12 miles to the west in the Fish Springs Range but .does not occur in either the Thomas or the Dugway Range. No fossils are known from the upper part of the Swan Peak formation, and the fossils from the three units overlying Hi_ntze's Kanosh shale are all Middle Ordovician in age. The stratigraphy of the "Swan Peak quartzite" of Hintze (1951, p. 20-21) and of Webb (1956, p. 11-12) in the Confusion Range does not resemble the quartzite of the Swan Peak formation in other parts of western Utah. Furthermore, the stratigraphy of the "Swan Peak" of Hintze and Webb shows considerable variation in lithology between sections in western Millard County measured by Hintze (1951, p. 67, 69, 74-75, 82-83). Inasmuch as this unit stratigraphically resembles neither the quartzite of the Swan Peak formation nor the Eureka quartzite and occurs only in the area of thickest deposition during the Middle Ordovician, we believ~ this unit to be only local :tn extent.

Thickness.-The Fish Haven dolomite was measured in the following four places : (1) 2,000 feet north of the Floride mine on Spor Mountain in the
NEltiNE1ti sec: 3, T. 13 S., R. 12 ·w., (2) 1 mile S.
63° E. of the Lost Sheep mine on Spor Mountain, (3) 5,000 feet S. 30° W. from peak, 6,830. in the Dugway Range, and (4) 7,400 feet N. 74° W. from the top of Castle Mountain in the Dugway Range. The thickness in the four sections is 305, 280, 225, and 310 feet, respectively. The average thickness of the Fish Haven is about 290 feet.
Age and correlation.-Fossils are not common in the Fish Haven dolomite in either the Thomas or the Dugway Range. Poorly preserved unidentifiable cup corals have been noted in a number of widely scattered areas. The best preserved fossils were found in a 20-foot limestone bed that is locally present near the top of the lower member in the southern part of Spor Mountain. Collections were made from this unit along a canyon bottom 2,100 feet due north of the Floride mine and on a small ridge 3,100 feet S. 5° E. of the Floride mine. The two collections were almost identical. The following fossils were identified by Helen Duncan and Jean M. Berdan :
Oatazyga? sp. Hesperorthis sp. Favosites sp. Fardenia sp. Horn coral, undet. Bryozoans, undeter. High-spired gastropod, undet. Stromatoporoids
A collection of fossils was also made from a dolomite at approximately the same stratigraphic horizon in the northern end of the Fish Springs Range 10 miles to the west of the area mapped. R. J. Ross, Jr. (1952, written communication) examined some of the fossils from this collection and reported gastropods of the "Hormotoma-type" and brachiopods that may belong to Oatazyga cf. 0. anticostien.sis (Billings). Jean M. Berdan (1955, written communication) examined other fossils from the collection and reported that it "contains two multiserial 11alysites-like corals referable to the recently_ described genus ltfanipora.
* * * Corals of this type occur in the Montoya lime-

Staatz and Osterwald (1959, p. 21-22) in their report on the Thomas Range fluorspar district. It was named from exposures at the Floride mine on the east side. of the central part of Spor Mountain.
The Floride dolomite is most common on Spor Mount~in, where it occurs mainly along the east side of the mountain. In the Dugway Range it is found mainly in three areas: (1) on the east side of the southern part of Fandangle Canymi, (2) north, west, and south of peak 6,830, and (3) west of Castle Mountain on the west side of the Dugway Range.
Lithology.-In general the Floride dolomite consists of thin-bedded fine-grained gray smooth-weather-

Thickness.-Although the Floride dolomite is generally poorly exposed, its total thickness can be measured with considerable accuracy; it lies between the resistant dolomites in the overlying and underlying formations. The Floride was measured at three places on Spor Mountain and at two in the central part of the Dugway Range. From south to north these localities are: (1) 2,600 .feet north of the Floride mine · in NEl,4 sec. 3, T. 13 S., R. 12 W., (2) 5,800 feet S.

42 GEOLOGY AND MINERAL DEPOSITS, THOMAS AND DUGWAY RANGES, UTAH

thickness of the Floride dolomite at these five localities is 135, 120, 100, 100, and 100 feet, respectively. These figures indicate that the formation thins from the south end to the north end of Spor Mountain, but from there to the Dugway Range the thickness remains constant.
Age and correlation.-Fossils are extremely rare in the Floride dolomite; the only ones noted were poorly preserved unidentifiable cup corals found about half a mile north of the Floride mine on Spor Mountain. Near the top of the underlying Fish Haven the Late Ordovician coral Palaeophyllum has been found, and in the lowest beds of the overlying Bell Hill dolomite a collection of seven Silurian corals has been made. Thus, the age of the Floride may be Late Ordovician, Silurian,.. or. both.
ROCKS OF SILURIAN AGE
In the area mapped, Silurian sedimentary rocks make up most of Spor Mountain; they are also found in the Dugway Range near the head of Fandangle Canyon, ·northwest and south of peak 6,830, and on the mountain 4,000 feet w.est of Castle Mountain. In all these areas, the rocks of Silurian age are highly faulted; the most complete sections are found on Spor Mountain.
The Thomas and Dugway Ranges lie in the eastern part of the Silurian geosyncline. The eastern border of this geosyncline lies from 2 to 20 miles east of the East Tintic Mountains and trends roughly north to Great Salt Lake and then turns to the east. In the East Tintic Mountains (Morris and Lovering, 1961, p. 64), the Silurian section is less than 300 feet thick and is entirely within the Bluebell dolomite, which also contains rocks of Late Ordovician and ·Devonian age. The Silurian section thickens westward towards the central part of the geosyncline, and on Spor Mountain in the Thomas Range it is about 1,200 feet thick. The section within the deeper part of the original geosyncline shows soine local variation for at Gold Hill (Nolan, 1935, p. 17) it is only 970 feet thick. Elsewhere the thickness remains fairly constant westward to the western part of White Pine County, Nev. West of this area the section thickens again, and 4,100 feet of Silurian sedimentary rocks has been reported in the Roberts Mountains (Nolan, Merriam, and Williams, 1956, pl. 2).
Silurian sedimentary rocks in most areas in Utah have been called the Laketown dolomite and correlated with the type section in the Randolph quadrangle in northeastern Utah (Richardson, 1941, p. 18). In two areas other names have been used. One of

these is the East Tintic Mountains where the sedimentary rocks were deposited on the sloping shelf of the geosyncline;· these sedimentary rocks are much thinner and lithologically are quite different from the Laketown of other areas. The other area is in western Millard County, where Rush (1956, p. 20-25) correlated the lower part of the Silurian sequence with the Roberts Mountains formation of eastern Nevada and named two new formations the Jack Valley formation and the Decathon dolomite. We examined some of these rocks in the southern part of the Confusion Range and found that they resemble rocks rnapped as Laketown in other areas.
On Spor Mountain in the Thomas Range and in the Dugway Range, we mapped four new Silurian formations (the Bell Hill "dolomite, the Harrisite dolomite, the Lost Sheep dolomite, and the Thursday dolomite) in addition to the previously described Floride dolomite, which is tentatively assigned to the Ordovician and Silurian systems. These five units are fairly widespread and were recognized by us also in the northern part of the Fish Springs Range and the southern part of the Confusion Range.
Among the fossils collected from the four dolomites of Silurian age in the Thomas and Dugway Ranges, types such as F avosites sp., H alysites sp., H eliolites sp., and V irgiana sp., are similar to those in the Laketown dolomite in the Logan quadrangle of northeastern Utah (Williams, 1948, p. 1138), the Randolph quadrangle of northern Utah and western Wyoming (Richardson, 1941, p. 18), and the Gold Hill mining district in western Utah (Nolan, 1935, p. 18) . Gardner 2 also reported Laketown dolomite in the vVest Tintic Range. According to Jean Berdan and Helen Duncan (1953, written communication), who examined the fossils from our area, some of the collections contain elements not observed in the Laketown. Although the Silurian rocks of the Thomas and Dugway Ranges appear to correlate, at least in part, with the Laketown of northeastern Utah, uncertainty of the· exact age range of the type Laketown prevents precise correlation.
BELL HILL DOLOMITE (MIDDLE SILURIAN)
The Bell Hill dolomite was originally described by Staatz and Osterwald (1959, p. 23-25) in their report on the Thomas Range fluorspar district. The formation was named from outcrops at the Bell Hi]] mine on the southern end of Spor Mountain.
The Bell Hill dolomite is. found in five general areas: (1) fault blocks scattered throughout the cen-

tral and southern parts of Spor Mountain, (2) fault blocks along the east side of the southern end of Fandangle Canyon, (3) fault blocks north, west, and south of peak 6,830 in the Dugway Range, (4) a small patch 6,000 feet southwest of Castle l\1ountain on the west side of the Dugway Range, and (5) a number of adjacent fault blocks on the west side of the Dugway Range west of Castle l\1ountain.
Lithology.-In the Dugway Range the Bell Hill dolomite consists of alternating gray and dark-gray dolomite, with a massive dark-gray dolomite unit at the base and a light-gray, partly limy dolomite unit at the top. On Spor Mountain, the. formation is dark-gray coarse-grained dolomite except for the light-gray, partly limy dolomite at the top. The formation shows minor local variations in both areas.
The bottom of the Bell Hill dolomite is placed at the base of a ledge of black dolomite that overlies the slope-forming light-gray Floride dolomite. The top of the formation is placed at th·e bottom of a massive ledge of black dolomite that forms the base of the Harrisite formation.
The lowest unit of the Bell Hill dolomite is a conspicuous ledge of massive coarse- to medium-grained. dark-gray to black dolomite, characterized by sandsize dolomite grains, color banding, and local crossbedding. A marker bed 3 to about 20 feet thick near the base of this unit contains angular lenslike pieces of a lighter gray dolomite in the darker matrix. Cup corals a,re common in this marker. A banded zone composed of dolomite and brown chert stringers and .lenses is found locally near the base of the unit in the Dugway Range. The lower dark dolomite unit is much thicker in the Thomas Range than in the Dugway Range, and locally it becomes lighter gray.
In the Dugway Range the middle part of the formation is made up of alternating light- and dark-gray beds which are 6 inches to 2 feet thick and consist of f·ine-grained sandy-textured, ·locally laminated dolomite. The color of individual beds commonly light~ ens or darkens along strike. The lighter colored beds in this interval, some of which weather tan, are typically pock-marked with numerous cavities or ovalshaped areas of darker dolomite as much as 1 mm across. Some of these cavities may be remains of nJgae. A thin section of this rock contained about 75 percent dusky, very fine grained anhedra of dolomite, 20 percent oval areas of darker very fine grained dolomite with concentric structure, and 5 percent cavities. Most of the cavities are lined with a coarser grained carbonate, probably calcite. No quartz was present m the slide.

The upper part of the formation in both the Thomas

and Dugway Ranges is commonly a banded fine-

grained smooth-weathering light-gray dolomite, which

is locally 'limy. It is less resistant to weathering

than the overlying and underlying dolomite, and is

generally covered.

A detailed stratigraphic section of this formation

made on Spor Mountain is given in Staatz and Oster-

wald (1959, p. 19), and another section measured in

feet S. 52° ,V. of peak 6,830 in the central Dugway
Range. The Bell Hill dolomite is 410, 430, 395, and
340 feet thick, respectively, at these four localities.
At the second locality minor faulting may have re-

peated part of the section. These sections show, in general, northward thinning of the formation.
Age and correlation.-The Bell Hill dolomite is the most fossiliferous of all the formations of Silurian age in the area mapped. Fossils are most abundant in the lower part of the formation, rare in the upper part. The most conspicuous fossil-bearing bed, which is a detrital dolomite containing thin lighter gray dolomitic lenses, is 4 to 20 feet above the base of the formation. This unit contains chiefly cup corals, and is apparently continuous throughout Spor Mountain and the Dugway Range. It also was noted in the northern part of the Fish Springs Range.
Fossils collected from three places in this horizon were identified by Jean M. Berdan and Helen Duncan. Two of the collections were made near the Bell Hill mine in the southern part of Spor Mountain. The first collection came from the top of a low ridge 350
feet S. 4° E. of the main ore body and contained:
H alysites ( Catenipora?) sp. Pycnactis? sp. and other horn corals Cephalopods, undet. Crinoid columnals
The second collection came from a small dr~w 200 feet S. 40° W. of the main ore body and contained:
Circophyllum sp. H eliolites sp. Favosites sp. (small corallites) H alysites ( Cystihalysites) sp.
( Catenipora?) sp. Pycnactis? sp. and other horn corals Entelophyllum? sp. Stromatoporoids Branching favositid corals Fragments of pentameroid brachiopods Cephalapod, undet.
The third collection came from the northeastern part of Spor Mountain, 5,000 feet S. 52° E. of the Lost Sheep mine and contained :
Favosites sp. H alysites ( Catenipora?) sp. Pycnactis? and other horn corals
Horn corals were collected from several other localities at this horizon, but were unidentifiable.
Fossils are scattered throughout the overlying 100 to 150 feet of strata, but no persistent fossiliferous horizons are evident. Berdan and Duncan identified the following fossils from these beds :
Favosites sp. A (small corallites) sp. B (large corallites) (palaeofavosites?) cf. F. asper Orbigny
Halysites sp. (large corallites) Horn corals, undet. Platyceratid gastropod Virgiana cf. V. decussata (Whiteaves)

The assemblage is considered to be of Middle Silunan age.
A unit equivalent in age and lithology to the Bell Hill dolomite was noted by us in the northern part of the Fish Springs Range and the southern part of the Confusion Range. The Bell Hill is tentatively correlated with a part of the Bluebell dolomite in the East Tintic Mountains (Morris and Lovering, 1961, p. 63-70) and with a part of the Roberts Mountains formation in the Eureka mining· district, Nevada (Nolan, Merriam, and Williams, 1956, p. 36-37).
HARRISITE DOLOMITE (MmDLE SILURIAN)
The Harrisite dolomite was named by Staatz and Osterwald (1959, p. 25-26) from exposures at the Harrisite mine on the south end of Spor Mountain.
The Harrisite dolomite is found in five general areas: (1)" numerous northeast-trending fault blocks throughout Spor Mountain, (2) a small patch in the southern end of Fandangle Canyon, (3) fault blocks on the north, west, and south sides of peak 6,830 in the Dugway Range, (4) several patches 5,000 feet southwest of Castle Mountain on the west side of the Dugway Range, and (5) several fault blocks west of Castle Mountain on the west side of the Dugway Range.
Lithology.-The Harrisite dolomite is relatively uniform in its lithology throughout the Thomas and Dugway Ranges, where it consists entirely of massive medium-grained dark-gray to black sandy-textured dolomite. The formation overlies the slopeforming light-gray dolomite of the Bell Hill dolomite and underlies dark- to light-gray limy cherty dolomite of the Lost Sheep dolomite.
In addition to the persistent black to dark-gray color and the sandy texture, the Harrisite dolomite is characterized by numerous faint wormlike markings of white dolomite. The white markings in some places can be shown to be the remains of the chain coral 11alysites. These markings are locally scarce in the lower 10 to 30 feet of the formation but become more numerous upwards.
The basal 10 or 15 feet of the formation is faintly mottled, somewhat limy, and color banded, and locally exhibits a brownish cast. Blebs, layers, and fracture fillings of black and brown chert make up 5 to 20 percent of the rock at some localities, particularly on Spor Mountain. Three stratigraphic sections made on Spor Mountain have previously been published· (Staatz and Osterwald, 1959, fig. 2). A detailed section of this formation from the west-central part of the Dugway Range is given below.

J.'hiclcness.-The I:Iarrisite dolomite is well exposed; it was measured in three places on Spor l\1ountain and two places in the central part of the Dugway Range. These localities from south to north are: (1) the type section, 2,000 feet N. 28° W. of the Bell I-Iill mine in sec. 10, T. 13 S., R. 12 "\iV., (2) 5,000 feet S. 46° E. of the Lost Sheep mine, (3) 2,750 feet southwest of the Blowout mine, (4) 5,000 feet S. 53°
,V. o:f peak 6,830 in the central part of the Dugway
Range, and (5) 9,200 feet S. 75° "\iV. of Castle l\1ountain. The I:Iarrisite dolomite is 175, 110, 120, 145, and 140 feet thick, respectively, at these localities. This :formation shows a greater variation in thickness on Spor l\1ountain than it does between Spor l\1ountain and the central part of the Dugway Range. l'his variation suggests that the differences in thickness are due mainly to local changes in sedimentation. The average thickness of the I-Iarrisite dolomite in this area appears to be about 140 feet.
Age and co'rrelat'ion.-The I-Iarrisite dolomite contains considerable fossil debris. Ilalysites sp. and crinoid stems are commonly present but in general
n.re poorly preserved. Easily identifiable fossils are
rare. The best preserved fossils found were silicified remains collected on a hill just east of the I-Iarrisite
mine. These were studied by P. E. Cloud, Jr., of the
U.S. Geological Survey, who identified: Ilalysites
sp., pentamerid brachiopod, undetermined gastropod,
crinoid stem. Cloud (1952, written communication) stated, "Although Jlalysites, in the broad sense, is it'.self an equivocal elating element in the Great Basin
region, being about as common or more common in

the Upper Ordovician Bighorn dolomite (as the subgenus or closely related genus (Oatenipora) as in the Silurian, the presence of a large pentamerid brachiopod, even though not determinable as to genus, is presumptive evidence of Silurian age. The horizon is probably equivalent to some part of the Blu~bell dolomite of the East Tintic Mountains." The Silurian age of these rocks can also be verified by their stratigraphic position above the Bell Hill dolomite and below the Thursday dolomite, both of which contain fossils of Middle Silurian age.
A unit equivalent to the Harrisite dolomite was also noted by us in the north end of the Fish Springs Range and in the Confusion Range. The Harrisite dolomite is tentatively correlated with a part of the Roberts Mountains formation of the Eureka district; Nevada (Nolan, Merriam, and Williams, 1956, p. 36-37).
LOST SHEEP DOLOMITE (MIDDLE SILURIAN)
The Lost Sheep dolomite was originally described by Staatz and Osterwald (1959, p. 26-28) in their report on the Thomas Range fluorspar district. It was named from outcrops of this formation at the Lost Sheep mine in the northern part of Spor Mountain.
The Lost Sheep dolomite is most common on Spor Mountain and on the neighboring Eagle Rock Ridge where it is found in_ northeast-trending fault blocks. This formation is less extensive in the Dugway Range, where it occurs in three areas: (1) the southern part of Fandangle Canyon, (2) north, west, and south of peak 6,830, and (3) west and southwest of Castle Mountain on the west side of the range.
Lithology.-The lower and middle parts of the Lost Sheep dolomite consist chiefly of light-gray and some dark-gray sandy-textured dolomite with a little chert; the upper part is gray dolomite containing numerous parallel chert baJ?.ds. The lower contact of the formation is placed at the base of the lowest light-gray dolomite bed, and the top of the formation is the top of the highest bed containing chert bands.
The basal beds of the Lost· Sheep dolomite are coarse grained, sandy textured, and limy. This unit varies in color, and on Spor Mountain it is chiefly a light-gray saccharoidal dolomite that closely resembles the overlying Thursday dolomite, but at many places in the Dugway Range it -is a dark gray weathering to a medium gray that is similar to the color of the underlying Hatrisite dolomite. The absence

46 GEOLOGY AND MINERAL DEPOSITS, THOMAS AND DUGWAY RANGES, UTAH

of H alysites, however, serves in most places to distinguish the dark facies of the Lost Sheep dolomite from the dark dolomite of the Harrisite.
The next higher unit is a dark-gray to black medium- to fine-grained, locally banded dolomite with 1 to 20 percent gray to black chert in bands and lenses 1 to 5 inches thick. Overlying this cherty zone is bluish-gray medium-grained mottled dolomite, which is limy in places. This mottled dolomite, together with the underlying dark cherty dolomite, forms a good marker zone.
The middle part of the formation is composed of a light-gray to white, slightly limy medium- to coarse-grained saccharoidal dolomite, which on Spor Mountain resembles the basal part of the Lost Sheep dolomite. ·Locally parts of·this unit are darker gray· and contain a little chert.
The top part of the formation, which averages about 70 feet thick, is a ledge-forming medium- to fine-grained gray to dark-gray dolomite. This unit generally contains from 15 to 75 percent pink or gray chert, mostly in 1- to 5-inch discontinuous bands parallel to the bedding. In the northern part of Spor Mountain the .chert is generally pink or white, but elsewhere is predominantly gray. In a few places chert may constitute as much as 95 percent of the rock, while in other places it may be absent from some of the beds within this unit. This cherty unit is a persistent and excellent marker zone.
Two complete sections and the lower part of a third section found on Spor Mountain have been published previously (Staatz and Osterwald, 1959, fig. 2). A detailed stratigraphic section in the west-central part of the Dugway Range is given below.

Analysis of the carbonate fraction of two samples from the lower and upper parts.of the.formation yielded 95 and 96 percent dolomite, respectively (table 5).
Thickness.-Although good exposures of the full thickness of the Lost Sheep dolomite are fairly common in the northern part of Spor Mountain, they are rare in the central Dugway Range, where we were able to measure a complete section at only one place. Two sections of the entire formation were measured in the northern part of Spor Mountain. These three localities from north to south are: (1) 9,300 feet S. 75° W. of Castle Mountain, (2) 2',750 feet S. 21° W. of the Blowout mine, and ·(3) 3,000 feet S. 61° E. of the Thursday mine. The thickness of the Lost Sheep is 270, 215, and 245 feet, respectively. The lower member of this formation makes up from 150 to 205 feet of these sections, the upper member from 65 to 90 feet. The lower member of the Lost Sheep was also measured 2,500 feet N. 30° W. of the Bell Hill mine where it is 160 feet thick.
Age and correlation.-The Lost Sheep dolomite is in general poorly fossiliferous, fossils being most common in the black chert-bearing dolomite in the lower member. Although fossil fragments are common in the lower member, they are so poorly preserved that they are difficult to identify. Several collections made from this unit on Spor Mountain -were examined by Jean Berdan and Helen Duncan. The following types were noted: crinoid stems, smooth pentameruid brachiopod, ribbed brachiopod, and gastropod. In addition, a coral was collected from the upper member near the Harrisite mine in the southern part of Spor Mountain. Berdan and Duncan identified this fossil as H alysites (OystihalysitetB) sp. The presence of H alysites (Oystihalysites) sp. and a pentameroid brachiopod indicates a Silurian age for these rocks. Confirmatory evidence is the stratigraphic position of the Lost Sheep dolomite above the Bell Hill dolomite and below the Thursday dolomite, both of which contain fossils of Middle Silurian age.

GENERAL GEOLOGY

47

A unit equivalent to the Lost Sheep dolomite was noted by us in the north end of the Fish Springs Range and in the southern part of the Confusion Range. The Lost Sheep dolomite is correlated with a part of the central part of the Laketown dolomite and tentatively correlated with a part of the Roberts Mountains formation in the Eureka district (Nolan, Merriam, and Williams, 1956, p. 36-37).
THURSDAY DOLOMITE (MIDDLE SILURIAN)
The Thursday dolomite was named by Staatz and Osterwald (1959, p. 28-29) for exposures at the Thursday mine in the northern part of Spor Mountain.
The Thursday dolomite crops out in numerous northeast-trending fault blocks on Spor Mountain. It is most common in the northern part of Spor Mountain, but is also common in the southern part, along the west side, and on Eagle Rock Ridge. The Thursday dolomite is less common in the Dugway Range where it is found mainly in three areas: (1) outcrops on the east side of Fandangle Canyon; (2) fault blocks north, west, and southwest of peak 6,830, and (3) fault blocks southwest of Castle Mountain on the western side of the Dugway Range.
Lithology.-The Thursday dolomite is a rather uniform light-gray medium-grained saccharoidal, somewhat friable rock which is generally a slope maker. The lower contact is the top of the highest cherty beds .of the Lost Sheep dolomite; the upper contact is at the base of the fine-grained dense light-gray dolomite of the Sevy dolomite.
A medium-grained gray dolomite approximately 15 feet thick with 1- to 4-inch bands of pink chert parallel to the bedding occurs about 135 feet above the base of the formation in the northern part of Spor Mountain. Lithologically his unit is indistinguishable from the cherty member at the top of the Lost Sheep dolomite. Brown chert occurs as a fretwork along fractures in many places in the Thursday dolomite, particularly in the upper third of the formation.
Insoluble residues of the dolomite show that it contains minor amounts of clear quartz grains and white chert. Uniform-sized subhedral dolomite crystals averaging about 0.4 mm across make up almost all of a .thin section examined. A few cavities are lined with dolomite and minute amounts of subhedral quartz grains. The carbonate fraction of a sample of Thursday dolomite contained 98 percent dolomite (table 5).
Thiclcness.-Although the Thursday dolomite is quite common on Spor Mountain, and is exposed in a few places in the western part of the Dugway Range

as well, its thickness is difficult to measure. In the Dugway Range the Thursday dolomite is not found jn contact with the overlying Sevy dolomite, and on Spor Mountain no complete section is found owing to the numerous faults. The thickness was estimated by combining two partial sections. The lower part of this formation from the base to a bed containing a network of thin chert was measured 100 feet west of the Blowout mine, and the thickness from the bottom of this bed to the overlying Sevy dolomite was measured 1,400 feet to the southeast. The composite thickness, thus obtained, is 330 feet.
Age and correlation.-The Thursday dolomite is poorly fossiliferous, and even traces of fossil debris .are rare. Identifiable fossils were found only at two localities where they had been replaced by chert. Jean· Berdan and Helen Duncan examined these collections. The species of Halysites was identified by E. J. Buehler. The best collection came from the north end of Spor Mountain, 5,000 feet N. 41° W. of ·the Lost Sheep mine, and contains the following:
Zelophyllum aff. Z. intermedium Wedekind H alysites magnitubus Buehler Favosites? sp. (small corallites) Alveolites sp. Stromatoporoids
The other collection came from the west .side of the Dugway Range, 6,700 feet S. 50° W. of peak 6,830, and contains the following :
H alysite.s sp. H eliolites? sp. Beak of pentameroid brachiopod
According to Berdan and Duncan (1952 and 1955, wr.itten communications) both collections are Middle Silurian in age.
A unit lithologically similar and in the same relative position in the section as the Thursday dolomite was noted by us in the northern part of the Fish Springs Range and the southern part of the Confusion Range. The Lost Sheep is correlated with the upper part of the Laketown dolomite of western and northern Utah, probably with part of the Bluebell dolomite of the East Tintic Mountains (~!orris and Lovering, 1961, p. 63-70), and with the upper part of the Roberts Mountains formation of the Eureka district, Nevada (Nolan,· Merriam, and Williams, 1956,
p. 36-37).
ROCKS OF DEVONIAN AGE
Sedimentary rocks of Devonian age in the Thomas and Dugway Ranges, with the exception of those belonging to the Lower and Middle ( ~) Devonian Sevy

48 GEOLOGY AND MINERAL DEPOSITS, THOMAS AND DUGWAY RANGES, UTAH

dolomite, differ considerably in lithology and thickness from known rocks of Devonian age in surrounding areas. The Devonian sedimentary rocks are about 6,000 feet thick in the northern part of the Dugway Range, and may be more than 7,000 feet thick in the Black Rock Hills. The greater thickness of the Devonian section in the area mapped is for the most part in the Upper Devonian, where the sedimentary rocks are approximately 4,000 feet thick and represent one of the greatest thicknesses of Upper Devonian rocks known in the western United States.
Upper Devonian rocks in nearby parts of the Great Basin are much thinner. The Devonian rocks in the Gold Hill district, reported by Nolan (1935, p. 18-21) to be of Early and Middle Devonian age, have been shown by further w9rk (C. W. Merriam, 1955, written communication) to contain scme beds of Late Devonian age. According to Merriam, approximately ~00 feet of the- Guilmette formation, the beds including Platyschisma ~ cf. P. rnccoyi Walcott and above, is probably of Late Devonian age. In the Confusion Range, Hose (1955, written communication) measured 2,650 feet of Guilmette formation, of which 75 to 400 feet is Late Devonian; in the East Tintic l\1ountains, Morris and Lovering (1961, p. 63-78) measured 300 to 600 feet of sedimentary rocks of Late Devonian age; at Newark Mountains in the Eureka, Nevada, region Nolan, Merriam, and Williams (1956, p. 48-52) found that the upper member of the Devils Gate formation is 790 feet thick. The Middle-Late Devonian boundary lies in the upper half of this member. Thus, on three sides of the Thomas and Dugway Ranges the sedimentary rocks of Late Devonian age do not exceed 600 feet in thickness; this thickness contrasts markedly with the approximately 4,000 feet of Upper Devonian rocks found in the mapped area.
The great local thickness of Upper Devonian rocks, together with the apparent shallow-water deposition of most of the rocks, suggests that during Late Devonian time the Thomas and Dugway Ranges were near the center of a rapidly sinking basin. Considerable differences in lithology do not permit exact correlations of these sedimentary rocks with formations in surrounding regions.
The sedimentary rocks of Devonian age in the Thomas and Dugway Ranges are divided into five formations, four of them new, and a local sequence of Upper Devonian rocks whose stratigraphic position is not certain. This last unit is mapped as Upper Devonian, undivided.
The lowermost Devonian formation in the area mapped is the Sevy dolomite, which has also been

reported in the Gold Hill region (Nolan, 1935, p. 1819), Confusion Range (Hose, 1955, oral communication), and numerous places in eastern Nevada (Osmond, 1954, p. 1914-1931). Overlying the Sevy is the Engelmann formation of Middle to Late Devonian age followed by the Goshoot formation, Gilson dolomite, and Hanauer formation, all of Late Devonian age. Except for the lower 800 feet of the Sevy dolomite, the Devonian rocks form an unbroken sequence in the northeastern part of the Dugway Range.
Sedimentary rocks -of Late Devonian age in the Black Rock Hills· are found in three separate areas or blocks containing rocks with similar lithology and fossils, but differing in their lithologic sequence. These blocks along with the various types of lithology exposed are shown in plate 3. The first block (A) in the northern half of the eastern part of the Black Rock Hills contains an unbroken sequence starting with the upper 1,000 feet of·the Engelmann formation and including the Goshoot formation, the Gilson dolomite, and most of the Hanauer formation. This block is separated from the second block (B) in the southern half of the eastern part of the hills by a fault with a minimum displacement of 3,100 feet. The sedimentary rocks in block B are chiefly limestone and some quartzite and a little dolomite. The third block (C) is a group of low hills approximately 4,000 feet southeast of block B. The sedimentary rocks in block C are dolomite, limestone, and quartzite.
The sedimentary rocks in all three blocks are similar in some places, but the detailed stratigraphy indicates that the sequence is not repeated. The bottoms of the sections in all three blocks begin at the upper margin of Lake Bonnevi11e sediments, and the tops of the sections are covered either by Lake Bonneville
sediments or Tertiary rocks. The paradoxical situation arises that a complete
stratigraphic section of Late Devonian rocks in the northeastern part of the Dugway Range correlates
well with the sedimentary rocks of block A in the Black Rock I-Iills, but has no apparent equivalents with the Upper Devonian sections in blocks B and C.
Possibly sedimentation during one part of the Late Devonian was greatest in the area of the Black Rock Hil1s, and during this relatively short time the sequences found in blocks B and C were deposited in this one area but not in the northeastern part of the Dugway Range, 12 miles to the northeast.
The position of the sedimentary rocks in blocks B and C within the Late Devonian sequence may be suggested in accordance with this hypothesis: Block A, which lies across Goshoot Canyon from block B, has

GENERAL GEOLOGY

part of the Engelmann formations missing. Inasmuch as it is very unlikely that such a large change in sedimentation could occur in the short distance across Goshoot Canyon, sediments in blocks B and C
probably occur in the missing parts of the section in block A. Of the two formations incompletely ex-
posed in block A, occurrence of the missing parts in

Sevy dolomite was named for its exposures in Sevy Canyon in the Deep Creek Range, where it was originally described by Nolan (1935, p. 18-19).

uppermost white sandy dolomite layer. Near the south end of Spor Mountain the contact is abrupt, and no interlayering is evident. The upper contact with the Engelmann formation is gradational; the top of the Sevy dolomite was placed on the base of a 10-foot unit of white massive dolomite, which underlies a 3-foot bed of black massive dolomite. These two thin b~ds are quite persistent and constitute a prominent sedimentary marker, even though some beds of Sevy-type lithology are present above them. Nolan (1935, p. 19) found a simil~,r break above the Sevy dolomite in the Gold Hill district.
A sample of the Sevy dolomite (table 5) collected northwest of Spor Mountain was analyzed for acid soluble MgO and CaO. The dolomite content calculated from this analysis makes up 96 percent of the carbonate fraction.
In thin section the Sevy dolomite is very fine grained and most of the rock consists of a mixture of clay and clay-sized dolomite grains. Scattered through the fine-grained matrix are numerous irregular-shaped aggregates of clear dolomite anhedra less than 1 mm across. The matrix also contains scattered clots of fine-grained clay and carbonate, all of which contain limonite.
Thickness.-No completely exposed section of the Sevy dolomite exists within the area mapped. Most of the Sevy in the mapped area occurs on the west side of Spor Mountain as isolated outcrops surrounded by gravels of Lake Bonneville. In order to obtain. ·at least an approximate thickness of this formation,
a measurement was made on the west side of Spor Mountain starting at a point 7,000 feet N. 68° W. of the Lost Sheep mine (fig. 50). Although approximately 60 percent of this area is covered and minor faulting may be present, this area is the best available
for measuring a section. The total indicated thickness of the Sevy dolomite at this locality is 1,120 feet.
At the type locality in Sevy Canyon, Nolan (1935,
p. 19) reported 450 feet of Sevy dolomite. Osmond (1954, p. 1911-1931) made a study of the Sevy, and measured 20 sections in eastern Nevada and 1 in western Utah. His measurements included 1,600 ~eet of Sevy in Kings Canyon in the Confusion Range, 567 feet in the Lime Mountains south of the Snake Range, and 570 feet at Big Springs Ranch in the
southern Snake Range. From all his data Osmond constructed an isopach map (1954, p. 1912), the
dominant feature of which is the thinning of the
Sevy along the Utah-Nevada line. Thus, the Sevy appears to be thinnest in its type area and thickens both to the east and to the west. East of the Thomas

Range the Sevy dolomite again thins, for Gardner (see footnote, p. 42) reported only 700 feet in the West Tintic Range. A short distance farther east, this formation evidently pinches out or is included in the Bluebell dolomite in the East Tintic Mountains.
Age and correlation.~No fossils have been found in Sevy dolomite in the Thomas and Dugway Ranges, and it is correlated with the Sevy dolomite in the Deep Creek Range on the basis of lithology. Nolan (1935, p. ·18) stated, "The Sevy dolomite is remarkably homogeneous throughout the· area of outcrop. The typical rock is well-bedded mouse-gray dolomite in layers 6 to 12 inches thick and weathers to a very light gray. It· is of extremely dense texture and has a conchoidal fracture. In most of the beds a faint lamination parallel to the bedding is visible, in part at least, because of slight differences in color in adjoini-ng laminae." This description might well have been used for the rocks mapped as Sevy in the Thomas and Dugway Ranges. The only fossils Nolan (1935, p. 19) found were small crinoid stems. Because the Sevy of the type locality has an unconformity at its base and grades into the overlying Simonson dolomite, which contains Middle Devonian fossils, Nolan considers the Sevy to be Devonian ·in age and probably Middle Devonian. The Eastern Nevada Geological Association Stratigraphic Committee (1953, p. 146) also considers the Sevy to be Devonian in age. More rec,ently Osmond (1954, p. 1928) has reported finding H alysites sp. in beds referred by him to the lower part of the Sevy dolomite in the southern part of the Egan Range in southernmost White Pine County, Nev. On the basis of this fossil, Osmond believed at least the lower part of the Sevy dolomite
is Silurian in age. Osmond (1954, p. 1914) correlated the Sevy with
the Lone Mountain formation, which has Upper Silurian fossils in its upper 600 feet (Nolan, Merriam, and Williams, 1956, p. 39) . His correlation is based on the striking lithologic similarity of the two formations and their comparative stratigraphic positions. Osmond's view to the contrary, the Sevy does not lithologically resemble the Lone Mountain, for the Sevy is a thin- to medium-bedded fine-grained dense rock (Nolan, 1935, p. 19) and the Lone Mountain is a thick-bedded to massive medium-grained saccharoidal rock (Nolan, Merriam, and Williams, 1956, p. 38). Hence, the rocks from which Osmond collected the H alysites may not be those generally con-
sidered to be Sevy. The present writers, mainly on the basis of work
by Nolan (1935, p. 18-19) and by the Eastern Nevada Stratigraphic Committee (1953; p. 146), consider the

GENERAL GEOLOGY

51

Sevy to be entirely Devonian in age and the lower-

most beds to be probably Early Devonian.

.

The Sevy dolomite probably can be correlate'a di-

rectly with the Beacon Peak dolomite member of the

Nevada formation at Eureka, Nev. These two forma-

tions have the same stratigraphic position, and accord-

ing to Nolan, Merriam, and Williams (1956, p..48)

are lithologically identical. The Sevy is also possi-

bly correlated with part of the upper half of the Blue-

bell dolomite of the East Tintic Mountains, but Mor-

ris and Lovering (1961, p. 63-70) did not actually

recognize any beds equivalent to the Sevy in that area.

ENGJ<J.LMANN !<'ORMATION (MIDDLE AND UPPER DEVONI.A.N
The Engelmann formation is here named from its exposures on both sides of Engelmann Canyon in the northeastern part of the Dugway Range.
The lower 350 feet of the Engelmann formation lying west of the northern part of Spor Mountain has been previously described as Simonson-Gullmette formation, undivided (Staatz and Osterwald, 1959, p. 31-32). This name was used for these poorly exposed outcrops because the Simonson dolomite and Guilmette formation overlie the Sevy dolomite in the Gold I-Iill district and have a somewhat similar lithology (Nolan, 1935, p. 19-21). The Simonson consists in its type section in the Gold Hill district of darkto medium-gray dolomite, and the Guilmette formation consists of interbedded limestone and dolomite and a few sandstone beds; the two formations are separated by a dolomitic conglomerate at the base of the Guilmette. In the relatively thin section exposed west of Spor Mountain, the lower part is dolomite and the upper part is dolomite and limestone. Because no dolomitic conglomerate is present and banded beds so characteristic of the Simonson dolomite at its type section are lacking, Staatz ·and Osterwald (1959, pl. 1) did not map the two formations separately. Further work in the Black Rock ·Hills and the Dugway Range has shown that the rocks previously mapped as Simson-Guilmette, undivided, are the basal part of a much thicker formation that we now call the Engelmann.
The Engelmann formation is exposed in four general areas: (1) isolated outcrops lying west of the northern part of Spor Mountain, (2.) a band 1.8 miles long extending ·northward from Goshoot Canyon in. the Black Rock Hills, (3) ·on the eastern tips of several ridges and on both sides of Engelmann Canyon, the type locality, in the northeast part of the Dugway Range, ·and (4) several low hills on the west side of the Dugway Range, approximately 2 miles south-southeast of the mouth of Cannon Canyon. This formation also extends northward into the

southern end of the Dugway Proving Ground SW quadrangle.
Lithology.-The Engelmann formation consists chiefly of a massive sandy-textured light-gray to black dolomite with some interbedded light-gray to black limestone in the lower half of the formation. The base of the formation is placed at the base of a 10-foot unit of massive white medium-grained dolomite on the northwest side of Spor Mountain and at the base of a massive black medium-grained dolomite in the northern part of the Dugway Range. In both areas the contact is placed where the first distinctly crystalline sandy-textured dolomite overlies the mouse gray aphanitic, thinly laminated dolomite typical of the Sevy. Above this horizon a few beds with Sevytype lithology occur interbedded with the more coarsely crystalline dolomites. The top of the Engelmann formation is placed at the bottom of the first quartzite marking the base of the Goshoot formation. Several dolomite beds in the upper part of the Engelmann formation contain some quartz sand.
Dolm;nite makes up the greater part of this formation, and in the Dugway Range the only exceptions are several limestone beds, the largest of which is approximately 30 feet thick. In the Black Rock Hills the upper 1,000 feet of this formation is entirely dolomite. Below this part of the section, dolomite is interbedded with limestone. The dolomite is medium to fine grained and, although it Tanges in color from light gray to black, medium and dark gray are the commonest colors. Chert is present in only a few beds. The crossbedding that was noted in several places indicates that in part the dolomite is of detrital origin. The dolomite beds near the base of the section northwest of Spor Mountain are commonly calcareous. The limestone, some of which is dolomitic, is similar to the dolomite in grain size and color.
A specimen of dolomite taken from near the base of the formation northwest of. Spor Mountain co~­ tained 75 percent dolomite in its carbonate fraction; a specimen of limestone taken in the same area contained only 1.4 percent dolomite in its carbonate fraction (table 5) .
The entire Englemann formation is present only in the vicinity of Engelmann Canyon in the Dugway Range. Because much of the formation is covered by alluvium in this area, no detailed stratigraphic section was measured. A partial section of the lower
350 feet, northwest of Spor Mountain has previously
been published (Staatz and Osterwald, 1959, p. 33).
A detailed section of the upper 1,036 feet in the
Black Roek Hills is given below.

. Thickness.-Although the Engelmann formation occurs in several localities in our area, only in the vicinity of Engelmann Canyon are both the lower and upper contacts exposed. This area is poor for measuring a section, however, because it consists of low ridges separated by wide alluvium-filled valleys. An approximate measurement made from the map indicates that the Engelmann formation is about 2,750 feet thick at this locality. Partial sections have been measured on the north side of Goshoot Canyon, where 1,035 feet of Engelmann dolomite is exposed, and west of Spor Mountain (Staatz and Osterwald, 1959, p. 33), where the basal 350 feet was measured.
Age and correlation.-Collections of fossils were made from the Engelmann formation in three general areas: (1) northwest of Spor Mountain, (2) the northeastern part of the Dugway Range south of Engelmann Canyon, and (3) the Black Rock Hills north of Goshoot Canyon. The first collections from northwest of Spor Mountain came from the lower 300 feet of the formation and were examined by Jean Berdan, who reported unidentifiable dolomitized brachiopods and the stromatoporoid Amphipora sp. Later collections of slightly better preserved brachiopods from the same locality were examined by C. W. Merriam, who stated that they are too poorly preserved for positive identification, but are probably Stringocephalus sp. The collection from the northeastern part of the Dugway Range, which came from approximately 700 feet above the base of the section, was examined by Merriam. This collection contains a thoroughly recrystallized stromatoporoid, which

GENERAL GEOLOGY

53

may be either Amphipora sp. or Oladopora sp., and a smooth-shelled brachiopod, not generically determinable, but suggestive of String.ocep halus sp. If the above brachiopods are Stringocephalus, then a Middle Devonian age is indicated for this p0_rt of the formation. The collections from the Black Rock Hills, which came from the upper 1,000 feet of the formation, were examined by several people. Fossils from the lower 80 feet of this 1,000-feet-thick sequence were examined by Merriam, who reported the following: Atrypa sp., Athyris cf. A. angelicoides Merriam, minute bellerophon-like gastropods, Straparollus cf. S. ophirensis Hall and Whitfield, and indeterminate conodonts. Merriam notes that the Atrypa is similar to a form occurring in the Late Devonian in the upper part of the Devils Gate formation, where Athyris angeliooides Merriam also occurs. Stromatoporoids from approximately 390 feet below the base of the Goshoot formation were examined by Richard Rezak, who reported ~Hermatostroma cf. H. episcopale Nicholson. The remaining fossils were examined by Berdan, who reported the following: Amphipora sp., Favosites cf. F. limitaris Rominger, Spongophyllum sp., Pachyphyllum sp., ramose favositicl coral, Atrypa sp., massive stromatoporoids, and an unidentifiable gastropod. Amphipom occurs in a number of beds. Position of the fossils in the various lithologic units in the Black Rock Hills is given in the detailed stratigraphic section on page 52. Berdan (1955, written communication) stated that the collection made from approximately 260 feet below the Goshoot formation "contains two species of the coral Pachyphyllum. This coral is generally considered to be indicative of Late Devonian age. It occurs in the Je:fferson dolomite in Montana, and has been used by Merriam (1940, p. 59-61) as a zone fossil for the lowest Upper Devonian in Nevada." Thus a Late Devonian age is indicated for the upper part and a probable Middle Devonian age for the lower part of this formation. . The position of the MiddleLate Devonian boundary is not known. However, a brachiopod closely resembling the Middle Devonian brachiopod Stringocephalus sp. is found about 700 feet above the base of the formation in the northern part of the Dugway Range, and inasmuch as Late Devonian fossils occur 1,000 feet below the top of formation in the Black Rock Hills, the position of
this boundary is probably somewhere in the middle part of the formation.
Because the Engelmann formation conformably
overlies the Sevy dolomite and contains fossils of
probable Middle and Late Devonian age, it appears
to be equivalent to all the Simonson dolomite and

most of the Guilmette formation of the Gold Hill district (Nolan, 1935, p. 19-21). The Engelmann formation is also tentatively correlated with most of the Silverhorn dolomite and the lower part of the \iVest Range limestone of the Pioche district, Nevacla (Westgate and Knopf, 1932, p. 16- 19), and with part of the upper half of the Bluebell dolomite of the East Tintic Mountains (Morris and Lovering, 1961, p. 63-70).
GOSHOOT FORMATION (UPPER DEVONIAN)
The Goshoot formation is here named from outcrops in Goshoot Canyon in the west-central part of the Black Rock Hills. Excellent exposures of this fonnation on the ridge on the north side of Goshoot Canyon (fig. 10) are designated the type section. Good sec-

tions are also exposed along the north side of Engelmann Canyon and in the Dugway Range on a small ridge at the northeast corner of the map area.
The Goshoot formation is exposed in three areas: (1) a north-trending band, 2.8 miles long, extending from Goshoot Canyon to the north end of the Black Rock Hills, (2) several disconnected bands between the north end of the map and Engelmann Canyon in the Dugway Range, and (3) outcrops on several low hills along the west side of the Dugway Range approximately 1.8 miles south of the mouth of Cannon Canyon. This formation also extends north of the area mapped into the southern part of the Dugway Proving Ground SW quadrangle.
Lithology.-The Goshoot formation consists of lightto clark-gray dolomite interbedded with brownweathering dolomitic and calcareous quartzite units,

54 GEOLOGY AND MINERAL DEPOSITS, THOMAS AND DUGWAY RANGES, UTAH

from 0.4 to 47 feet thick. The base of the Goshoot formation is placed at the base of the lowest quartzite in a series of rather closely spaced quartzite beds. No true quartzite is found in the Upper Devonian below this horizon, although several dolomite beds, 100 to 300 feet below this quartzite bed, contain some quartz sand. The top of the ·formation is placed at the top of an 80- to 110-foot unit of thick quartzite beds interbedded with dolomite. This unit commonly forms a prominent cliff. Several thin quartzite beds are in the lower 160 to 250 feet of the overlying Gilson dolomite.
Carbonate rocks, chiefly dolomite, make up 70 to 85 percent of the Goshoot frmation. The percentage of carbonate rocks is greater in the northern Dugway Range than in the Black Rock Hills, apparently owing to thinning of the quartzite beds. The dolomite is a fine-grained black, dark-gray, medium-gray, or light-gray rock, which in some places in the Dugway Range shows a faint mottling. Some of the dolomite contains streaks of quartz sand, which weather brown. Limestone occurs locally as a bed of fine-grained lightgray limestone about 25 feet thick about 20 feet above the base of the formation on a ridge 4,000 feet north of Goshoot Canyon, and as a ·10- to 20-foot bed of medium-gray limestone in the upper part of the formation on the ridge bounding the north side of Engelmann Canyon.
Quartzite in the Goshoot fo·rmation is a fine- to medium-grained light-gray to white rock that weathers brown. Crossbedding is present in a few places but is not nearly as common as in the younger Hanauer formation. The contacts between the quartzite and dolomite beds are straight and sharp in some places and gradational in others. In a few places the contacts are irregular, owing to slight scouring or channelling. Some of the quartzite is hard and vitreous appearing; some is friable and lacks vitreous luster. Cementing material of the harder quartzite is silica, and that of the more friable quartzite is dolomite, or in a few places, calcite. Carbonate cement is the most common.
A specimen of quartzite for mechanical analysis was collected from the lowermost quartzite bed in the Goshoot formation on the prominent ridge just north of Goshoot Canyon. Two other specimens of quartzite, one from the Hanauer formation, the other from the Upper Devonian sedimentary rocks, undivided, were analyzed at the same time for comparison. rhese specimens were crushed to approximately one-quarter of an inch and put in hydrochloric acid; the residue was washed, then disaggregated. in a mechanical blender, and the +250-mesh size was sieved for 10

minutes by a mechanical shaker.· The data for these mechanical analyses are presented in table· 7 and figure 11. The soluble pa:r;t of the rock is made up almost entirely of carbonates. The silt- and clay-size material (less than 250-mesh size) of the insoluble fraction was negligible and was ignored. The cumulative curves (fig. 11) of the three samples are .s1m1-

In general the steeper the curve the better sorted the sediment. The sorting may also be expressed as a figure called , the coefficient of sorting (So) (Trask, 1932, p. 71-72). According to Trask an So value of less than 2.5- indicates a well-sorted sediment; the So for the quartzite from the Goshoot formation is 1.24 (ta~le 7).

Thickness.-The Goshoot formation was measured along the prominent ridge bounding the north side of Goshoot Canyon, where it is 386 feet thick, and on a small ridge in the extreme northeast coi·ner of the mapped area in the Dugway Range, where it is 392 feet thick.
Age and correlation.-Fossil remains are common in the' dolomite of the Goshoot formation but are poorly preserved. Remains of cup corals, brachiopods, stromataporoids, and gastropods have been found, but most specimens could not be identified. Jean Berdan identified the dendroid stromatoporoid A1nphipora sp. (fig. 12) from several beds in this formation. Although this genus is fairly common in some beds of the Goshoot formation in the Black Rock Hills, it is much more in the overlying Gilson
dolomite. C. vV. Merriam identified fossils from the
other collections from the Goshoot formation. Atrypa sp. is found in three places: (1) just above the base of the formation in a small local limestone bed in the Black Rock Hills, (2) in the central part of the formation in dolomite on the prominent ridge north of Goshoot Canyon, and (3) near the top of the formation in local limestone beds in the northern part of the Dugway Range. With the At1·ypa at the first locality is Productella sp., which according to Merriam is similar to a form in the upper part of the Devils Gate formation of central Nevada.
Although none of these fossils are distinctive of
Late Devonian time alone, the position of this for-
mation below the Gilson dolomite and above the Eng-
elmann dolomite, both of which contain Late Devonian
fossils, indicates a Late Devonian age for the entire (ioshoot formation.

GILSON DOLOMITE ('OPPER DEVONIAN)
Gilson dolomite, named here for Gilson Canyon in the northeastern part of the Dugway Range, is well exposed on the ridges o<l both sides of this canyon. In this area, however, the Gilson is cut by a number of faults; therefore, the type section is designated along Hanauer Ridge. Another excellent, but somewhat . different, section of Gilson dolomite is on the ridge on the north side of Goshoot Canyon in the Black Rock Hills (fig. 10).
The Gilson dolomite occurs in four areas: (1) a north-trending band about 2.6 miles long extending from the north end of the Black Rock Hills to Goshoot Canyon, (2) a north-trending band about 2.2 miles long extending from Gilson Canyon to the north edge of the map area, (3) on low hills in the southern part of Bullion Canyon, and (4) on a numher of low hills on the west side of the Dugway Range, 1.8 miles south-southeast of the mouth of Cannon Canyon. This formation also extends north of the area mapped to the north end of the Dugway Range in the Dugway Proving Ground SVV quadrangle, and a short distance west of the area mapped into the central part of the Black Rock Hills.
L ithology.-The Gilson dolomite consists of lightto dark-gray dolomite. Its most distinguishing feature is the presence of numerous beds made up almost entirely of the stromatoporoid Amphipora (fig. 12) . The base of the formation is placed on top of a thick massive brown-weathering white quartzite bed that marks the top of the Goshoot formation. In the

GENERAL GEOLOGY

Black Rock 1-I:ills, several thin quartzite beds are found in the lower part of the Gilson dolomite above this thick cliff-forming quartzite bed. The top of the formation is placed at the base of the lowest quartzite of the overlying Hanauer formation.
The GDson dolomite consists of beds of light-, medium-, and dark-gray dolomite, which in general are fine grained but in the Black Rock Hills may be medium grained. Most of the dolomite is thick bedded to massive but a few units, generally light gray, are thin bedded. A sample taken from near the base of the Gilson dolomite on the north side of Goshoot Canyon contained 98 percent dolomite in its carbonate fraction (table 5). The quartzite in the lower part of the Gilson in the Black Rock Hills is a gray fine- to medium-grained well-cemented rock that weathers brown and occurs in units from 1 to 12 feet thick. The quartzitic dolomite units in the northeastern part of the Dugway Range are similar in color and grain size but consist chiefly of dolomite; a discontinuous quartzite bed is found on Hanauer Ridge 150 feet above the base of the formation. On the ridge west of Engelmann Canyon near the top of the section a 20-foot thick limestone bed is exposed for several hundred feet.
The Gilson dolomite, like the Hanauer formation
above and the Goshoot formation below, is believed to have been deposited in shallow water, chiefly because of the presence of large thick-shelled pelecypods (fig. 13). In Recent times, such thick-shelied forms generally live where they are subject to wave action.
The Gilson dolomite is 400 feet thicker in the northeastern part of the Dugway Range than it is in the Black Rock IIills. The differences in detailed stratigraphy between the two areas can be seen in the following sections.

Total thickness of Gilson dolomite _________ 1, 312. Goshoot formation: Quartzite, dolomitic, white, fine- to
medium...,grained; weathers brown in places.
Thickness.-The Gilson dolomite was measured along the prominent ridge bounding the north side of Goshoot canyon, where it is 914 feet thick, and along an east-northeast-trending ridge 3,000 feet north of Buckhorn Canyon, where it is 1,312 feet thick. The difference in thickness between these two localities 12 miles apart is probably due to differences in rate of sedimentation.
Age and correlation.-Fossils are fairly common in the Gilson dolomite, but preservation is poor. J\1ost of the material is fragmen.tal and includes pieces of brachiopods, crinoid stems, cup corals, gastropods, and pelecypods. The most common fossil is the branching stromatoporoid Amphipora (fig. 12), which practically makes up entire beds. Jean Berdan (1955, written communication) who identified this fossil stated, "This genus is extremely abundant in dolomitic rocks of Late and Middle Devonian· age in the West, and because it is commonly preserved as white dolomite in a dark dolomite matrix, the rocks containing it are often called 'spaghetti limestone.' Apparently more than one species is present in the material collected, to judge from the size of the cross-sections of the rods, but in most cases the material is not sufficiently

HANAUER FORMATION (UPPER DEVONIAN)
Hanauer formation is here named for exposures on Hanauer Ridge in the northeastern part of the Dugway Range, where the type section was measured.
The Hanauer formation is found in four areas: (1) an -outcrop band about 1 mile long on the west edge of the map area in the central part of the Black Rock Hills, (2) a band about 2 miles long that extends from the northern end of the map area to Gilson Canyon in the Dugway Range, (3) scattered fault blocks in Bullion Canyon, and (4) on two low

cent of the rock; in a few beds, however, the cementing material is silica. In the upper part of the formation where limestone is present, the cementing material is commonly calcite; elsewhere in the formation it is dolomite. In addition some quartzitic dolomite is present which contains from 2 to 30 percent quartz sand. Most of the quartz grains are rounded to well rounded and show a high sphericity; all are frosted.
A sample of quartzite for mechanical analysis was taken 520 feet above the base of the formation on the

hills on the !Vest edge of the Dugway Range, 1.8 miles prominent ridge bounding the north side of Goshoot

presented in table 7 (sample 2) and figure 11. The method used is the same as that used for a quartzite in the Goshoot formation, which is described on page 54. The graph (fig. 11) shows ·that the cumulative curve for the quartzite from the Hanauer formation is similar to the curves for two other Upper Devonian quartzites. The high degree of sphericity, the frosting, the very good sorting of the quartz grains, and the lack of feldspars and heavy minerals suggest that the quartz sand .was derived from an earlier quartzite. The conspicuous crossbedding, so persistent through much of the quartzite in the Hanauer formation, suggests deposition in shallow water.
Although the overall character of the Hanauer formation is the same in the Black Rock Hills and the north end of the Dugway Range, few individual beds can be recognized in both areas. A thick massive quartzite bed in one area may be represented by several closely spaced smaller quartzite beds in the other area. Some thickening and thinning of beds commonly takes place within short distances; but several quartzite beds have been traced for several miles along the entire front of the Black Rock Hills without any apparent change. In order to show the detailed lithology and the variation between the two areas, detailed stratigraphic sections are given below.

Thiakness.-ln complete section measured on Hanauer Ridge in the northeastern part of the Dugway Range, the Hanauer formation is 481 feet thick. A partial section was measured along the prominent ridge just north of Goshoot Canyon in the Black Rock I-Iills. This section ends on the westwardfacing dip slope of the hill where the angle· of slope npproximates the dip of the beds. At the foot of this dip slope the Hanauer formation is covered by Tertiary rhyodacite. The total thickness of this partial section is 732 feet. The much greater thickness of the Black Rock I-Iills section may be due to some unobserved faulting that repeated part of the section, or, more likely, it may be due to variation in sedimentation, which is common in other parts of the Upper Devonian. sequence.
Age and correlation.-Fossi]s are uncommon in the I-Ianauer formation. None have been noted in the northern part of the Dugway Range, and in the Black Rock Hills they are scarce. Jean Berdan iden-

tified Amphipora sp. from the lower 150 feet of the formation. Also present were the large thick-shelled pelecypods (fig. 13) so common in the Gilson formation. A short distance above these fossils, C. W. Merriam collected and· identified a poorly preserved rhynchonellid brachiopod resembling H ypothyridina e'lnJJ11.,on.si (Hall and Whitfield). Merriam also identified the brachiopods Oyrtospirifer monticola (Haynes) and Productella sp. from a bed 300 feet above the base of the formation and the brachiopod ~Rhipidomella sp., the pelecypod ~Paracyclas sp., and an indeterminate gastropod ·resembling Baylea from a bed 465 feet above the base of the formation.
Merriam (1955, written communication) made the following notations on these fossils : H ypothyridina emmonsi (Hall and Whitfield) occurs in the Late Devonian Pachyphyllum zone of central Nevada; the most diagnostic fossil is Oyrtospirifer montic:ola (Haynes), which is found in the upper Upper Devonian rocks. This fossil marks the highest faunal zone in the Devils Gate formation of the Eureka district, and is also found in the Three Forks limestone of Montana and Idaho. The suite of fossils inclu4,ing ~Rhipidomella, ~Parac'yclas, and the indeterminate gastropod resembling B aylea is too poorly preserved for positive identification; these fossils, if correctly identified, may be either Late Devonian or Early Carboniferous.
Thus, the greater part of the Hanauer formation is known to be Late Devonian in age. The DevonianMississippian boundary may lie in the upper part of this formation. In the absence of any diagnostic ~{is­ sissippian fossils the entire formation is here discussed under the Devonian system..
The Hanauer formation is correlated in part with the Pinyon Peak limestone of the East Tintic Mountains.
UPPER DEVONIAN SEDIMENTARY ROCKS, UNDrviDED
The undivided Upper Devonian sedimentary rocks are found in the southeastern part of the Black Rock Hills and in several outlying hills a short distance to the southeast: This area probably represents the locus of greatest sedimentation during Late Devonian time. These sedimentary rocks show a diverse lithology which does not match that found in the Dugway Range. The presence of Late Devonian fossils identifies their age, but the isolation of these rocks in fault blocks obscures 'their true position within the Upper Devonian. The sedimentary rocks are, therefore, mapped and described separately.
Lithology.-The rocks mapped as Upper Devonian sedimentary rocks, undivided, occupy blocks B and C

62 GEOLOGY AND MINERAL DEPOSITS, THOMAS "AND DUGWAY RANGES, UTAH

in the Black Rock Hills (pl. 3). Although each block contains dolomite, limestone, and quartzite, the thickness of the individual units, their sequence, and ·lithologic details vary between the two blocks (pl. 3).
The sedimentary rocks in block B consist chiefly of a uniform fine-grained medium-gray limestone, which is overlain by a unit of calcareous quartzite 115 feet thick. Several thinner 11nits of friable calcareous quartzite are also found in block B. In the southern part of this block a light-gray fine-grained limestone and a medium-gray medium-grained dolomite are present. An analyzed sample of the medium-gray limestone contained 2.3 percent dolomite in its carbonate fraction (table 5).
The quartzite that caps .the medium-gray limestone was examined in thin section; it contained approximately 50 percent quartz grains, 15 percent microcline grains, 5 percent plagioclase grains, and 30 percent · calcite cement. Accessory tourmaline and zircon were also noted. This was· the only Devonian quartzite in which feldspars were noted. The mineralogy of this quartzite suggests that it was derived from a granitic rock. Another quartzite exposed near the base of the hill was examined and found to consist of wellrounded frosted. quartz grains in a calcite cement. Mechanical analysis data from a specimen of this rock are presented)n table 7 (sample 3) and figure 11. A description of the method used is given on page 54. As can be seen from the shape of the cumulative curve, this quartzite· is similar in character to the other two Upper Devonian quartzites.
A detailed stra.tigraphic section of the thickest unfaulted area in block B is given below. Measuring began at a point 7,200 feet S. 16° E. of peak 5,712 in the Black Rock Hills.

The sedimentary rocks in block C consist chiefly of dolomite and quartzite at the south end of the block, and limestone and quartzite at the north end. · The limestone beds either thin southward or end abruptly against sm·all faults near the middle of the block. Although the fault displacement appears large on the west side of the main group of hills because of the sudden change from limestone to dolomite, only a small offset is indicated by the quartzite band along the eastern margin of the hills. The sudden change from limestone to· dolomite is, therefore, believed to be due to dolomitization of the limestone either by fluids that rose along the faults and went southward or by fluids that spread northward from an un~nown source and were stopped at the faults.
The limestone is similar to that in block B, being a medium-gray to black fine- to medium-grained rock. The most distinctive bed is a light-gray limestone conglomerate containing numerous coral "heads" broken from a reef. This bed, which is a little more than
20 feet thick, is exposed for about 500 feet on the
southeast side of block C. The dolomite in block C is also similar to the other Upper Devonian dolomites, ·being a light-gray to black fine- to medium-grained

sandy-textured, generally thick-bedded to massive rock.
Some of the quartzite units are similar to those in the Hanauer and Goshoot formations, but several are quite distinctive. These rocks are har~ olive-green fine-grained quartzite with little to no carbonate cement. The quartzite in block C commonly thins considerably in a short distance, and thus are unlike those in block A, which vary but little in a strike length of several miles. The thickest quartzite bed in block C, which occurs on the east side of the main group of hills, thins from more than 260 feet at its southernmost exposure to less than 30 feet in thickness at its northernmost outcrop (pl. 3).
A detailed section up the eastern face of the main group of hills is given below. It crosses both the thickest quartzite and the limestone conglomerate. Measuring began at a point 17,000 feet S. 13° E. of peak 5,712 in the Black Rock Hills.

Thwkness.-The total thickness of the rocks mapped as Upper Devonian sedimentary rocks, undivided, can · only be approximated because faults and covered areas separate individual blocks of these sedimentary rocks from one another. In block B, 515 feet of sedimentary rocks was measured in the thickest unbroken section; more than 285 feet of sedimentary_ rocks was measured in two smaller sections and from the map. Total thickness of sedimentary rocks in block B is at least 800 feet. The sedimentary _rocks in block C are considerably thicker. The measured section contained 600 feet but ·only went to the top of the first ridge. Beyond this ridge to the west edge of this group of hills and in the easternmost group of hills in block C, there is at least. an additional 2,100 feet of sedimentary rocks. The minimum thickness for the rocks mapped as Upper Devonian sedimentary rocks, undivided, appears to be 3,500 feet, and the thickness may be considerably greater.
Age and correlation.-Fossils representing at least 20 distinct genera were collected from 12 localities within the Upper Devonian rocks, undivided. A complete list of the fossils collected from these rocks is given in table 8. Collections 1 through 4 Ca!fle from block B, and 5 through 12 from block C. Collections 1, 5, and 8 c~me from measured sections, and the position of the fossils within these sections is given on pages 62 and 63.

ate made of limestone fragments and "heads" of coral broken from a reef (fig. 14). Merriam called this conglomerate Upper Devonian, and stated that its fossil suite represents the Pachyphyllum zone which underlies the , Cyrtospirifer zone in the Devils Gate formation of Nevada. Most of the other fossils in this block are not distinctive age markers, with the possible exception of Macgeea. Merriam stated (1955, written communication) that "Macgeea, where I have found it, is Late Devonian." Inasmuch as the limestone conglomerate occurs near the base of the section exposed in block C, the entire block is probably Late Devonian or younger in age.
Fossils in block B are fewer and less distinctive. Amphipora sp. is found in both Middle and Upper Devonian rocks. A Late Devonian age is favored for the rocks, however, owing to the presence of the large externally smooth thick-shelled pelecypods. This fosSil appears to be a new genus, which, according to

FIGURE 14.-Coral, Pachyphyllum, in limest one breccia reef, Upper Devonia n sedimentary rocks, undivided , in Black R ock Hills about 2.5 miles northwest of Wildhorse Spring,
Merriam, resembles the pelecypods Pycinodesma and Megrilomus in external form but differs in hinge structure. This pelecypod is widespread in the Black Rock Hills and is found in the Upper Devonian Gilson dolomite and in block C in several places, including the limestone conglomerate containing such typical Late Devonian forms as Pachyphyllum. This pelecypod has not been found in the Middle Devonian part of the Engelmann formation. In the Thomas and Dugway Ranges it appears confined to Upper Devonian sedimentary rocks. It is worthy of note that Kirk reported "Pycinodesma ~ sp." from near the top of the Guilmette formation at Gold Hill (Nolan, 1935, p. 21). According to Merriam (1955, written communication), the upper part of the Guilmette formation is now known to be Late Devonian, and the pelecypods found near Gold Hill, therefore, may be the same species as those found in the Black Rock Hills.
ROCKS OF MISSISSIPPIAN AGE
Sedimentary rocks of Mississippian age are found only . in the northern part of the Dugway Range (pl. 1) , where they form the uppermost part of the Paleozoic section. Butler first mentioned rocks of this age in this area (Butler, Loughlin, Heikes, and others, 1920, p . 460); he made a small collection of fossils in the Dugway mining district. The lithology of these rocks, however, was not described.

FIGUliE 15.- Crossbedding in quartzitlc limestone at tbe base of the Madison limestone equivalent, Hanauer Ridge. Field of view is about 5 feet across.
Thickness.-The upper and lower contacts of the Madison limestone equivalent are exposed in the area mapped only near the head of Buckhorn Canyon, but valley fill, broad covered areas, and the rolling topography made it impractical to measure the Madison equivalent in this area. Instead, it was measured up a steep east-facing slope about three-quarters of a mile north of the Four Metals mine in the Dugway Proving Ground SW quadrangle. The upper contact of the section was covered but is probably located within 20 feet of its true position. The thickness of the unit at this locality is at least 315 feet.
Age and correlation.-Fossils are common in certain intervals in the Madison limestone equivalent, but none were found in the lower 230 feet.
The corals were identified by W. J. Sando and the other fossils by Mackenzie Gordon, Jr., both of the U.S. Geological Survey.
The most conspicuous fossil horizon is in limestone beds that overlie the 10-foot quartzite bed in the upper part of the Madison equivalent in the northe.astern part of the Dugway Range. Four fossil collections (U.S. Geol. Survey collections 16731, 16732, 16734, and 16738) were made from this horizon in the outcrop band that crosses Buckhorn Canyon.

communication) noted that although smaller, it is also Early Mississippian in age.
The age of the lower part of the Madison limestone equivalent in the Thomas and Dugway Ranges is· not known. The lower part of the unit as mapped might be Late Devonian in age, but in the absence of fossils the Devonian-Mississippian boundary is tentatively placed at the base of the Madison equivalent, where a sharp change in lithology takes place.
The Lower Mississippian rocks in the Dugway Range resemble the rocks of this age in the Gold Hill district (Nolan, 1935, p. 25-26) in that both are principally medium-gray dense limestone with considerable chert in the upper .part and both conformably underlie the fine-grained reddish-brown sandy Wood-· man formation. In addition, the following fossils have been found in the Lower Mississippian rocks of both regions: Spirifer centronatus Winchell and species of Zaphrentites, Amplexus, Fenestella, Chonetes, Composita, Schizophoria, and Cleio·thyridina.
The upper part of the Madison limestone equivalent in the Dugway Range also contains the following fossils in common with the Madison as mapped in the Stockton and Fairfield quadrangles (Gilluly, 1932, p. 23-24), the Cottonwood-American Fork area (Calkins and Butler, 1943, p. 24), and the Randolph quadrangle (Richardson, 1941, p. 22) : Spirifer centronatus Winchell and species of Fe~nestella, Chonetes, CC~~Jnaro­ toechia, Composita, Cleiothyridina, Brachythyris ~, and Loxonema.
Fossils also indicate that the Madison limestone equivale~t of the Dugway Range correlates at least with parts of the Fitchville formation and the Gardison limestone of the East Tintic Mountains (Morris and Lovering, 1961, p. 85-86, 91-92), the Joana limestone of east-central Nevada (Nolan, Merriam, and Williams, 1956, p. 55-56) , and the Bristol Pass limestone of the Pioche district; Nevada (Westgate and Knopf, ·1932, p. 20-21) .
WOODMAN FORMATION (UPPER MISSISSIPPIAN)
The Woodman formation was named by Nolan (1935, p. 27) from its exposure on Woodman Peak on the southside of Dutch Mountain in the Gold Hill mining district. 'Rocks of similar lithology are found in the northern part of the Dugway Range overlying the Madison limestone equivalent.
The Woodman formation occurs in the mapped area only in the extreme northern part, within ll/2 miles of the northern boundary. The largest exposure is a little more than a mile long on a series of low hills along the east side of Bullion Qanyon. Other exposures are found in small fault blocks northwest of the Bertha mine and west of the Four Metals mine, on

68 GEOLOGY AND MINERAL DEPOSITS, THOMAS AND DUGWAY ,RANGES, UTAH

the west side of. Bullion Canyon, and northwest o:f Kellys Hole. The Woodman also is exposed on the northern tip .of the Dugway Range in the adjoining Dugway Proving Ground SW quadrangle.
Litlwlogy.-The Woodman formation consists in general of two parts: the lower half, made up chiefly of reddish-brown calcareous siltstone, and the upper half, made up chiefly of light-gray silty limestone. The base of the Woodman formation is placed at the base of the lowest siltstone, and the top of the Woodman is placed at the top of the uppermost silty limestone. The rocks directly above and below the Woodman are limestone and do not contain any silt. Some beds higher in ·the overlying Ochre Mountain limestone contain a little silt but generally much ~ess than do the beds of the Woodman formation, and they are bounded by limestone beds containing no silt.
The lower half of the Woodman formation is chiefly siltstone, although ·some limestone units and one quartzite unit are present. The siltstone weathers readily, and commonly is covered by rubble. Hills underlain by this rock are generally low, rounded, and red or brown in color. The siltstone is gray or
pinkish gray on a fresh surface but weathers to red-
dish brown or brown. These rocks are almost all thin bedded; beds commonly range from 1,4 to 4 inches thick. The siltstone consists of approximately equal amounts of subangular to well-rounded grains of quartz and of calcite cementing material with a few percent hematite. Diameters of both the quartz and calcite grains range from 0.02 to 0.10 ·mm. In some places the siltstone contains concentric diffusion bands consisting of a sequence of alternating thin light-gray and reddish-brown bands. The only difference observed. between the two types of bands is that one set was colored with hematite and the other was not.
Limestone is not common in the lower half of the Woodman formation; beds that are present resemble the limestone in the upper half of the formation.
A 20-foot bed of massive resistant quartzite occurs
in the upper part of the lower half of the Woodman formation. It forms a prominent ledge and is the only good marker bed in the formation. This rock is white medium-grained calcareous quartzite that weathers brown. It is coarser grained than the siltstone, having grains that range from 0.06 mm to 0.75 mm in diameter. The quartzite also differs from the siltstone in having more quartz and less calcite; the quartzite contains from 60 to 70 percent quartz grains.
The upper half of the Woodman formation is chiefly silty limestone, although a little siltstone similar to that described previously occurs near the base.

The silty limestone is a fine-grained light-gray rock with irregular patches of brown-weathering silt. Its beds are from lj2 to 4 inches thick, and this rock consists of about .two-thirds .calcite and one-third detritai material. The latter is chiefly subangular to wellrounded grains of quartz, but minor amounts of orthoclase and of plagioclase and traces of muscovite are also present. Grain size of the silty limestone is similar to the siltstone,. ranging from 0.02 mm to 0.20 mm in diameter.
The details of the lithology are given below in the only complete section of the woodman formation
found within the area mapped.

Thiolcness.-The upper contact of the Woodman formation is exposed only in two small areas on the east side of the head of Bullion Canyon. The lower contact is exposed only on the ridges between the various branches of Buckhorn Canyon. A section was measured between the two contacts along a ridge on the north side of the main branch of Buckhorn Canyon. This section was partially covered and a fault 0.4 mile to the northeast trends towards the measured section. If this fault cuts the section, then the thickness measured is less, probably by not more than 100 feet, than the true thickness. The Woodman formation was measured at this locality because it was the only place where even an approximate thickness could be obtained. The measured thickness of the Woodman here is 786 feet.
The thickness of the Woodman formation in the Dugway Range is about half that in the Gold Hill mining district where Nolan (1935, p. 28) measured approximately 1,500 feet.
Age and oorrelation.-Fossils are not common in the Woodman formation and none were found in the lower calcareous siltstone. The corals in these collections were identified by W. J. Sando, and the other invertebrates by Mackenzie Gordon, Jr. Fossil collections were small and were obtained from a number of widely scattered localities.
U.S. Geol. Survey collection 16723, made on the· .north side of Buckhorn Canyon between 170 and 180 feet from the top of the Woodman formation, contained the following :
Zaphrentites sp. Rhopalolasma sp. Productella hirsutiformis Walcott Rhipidomella aff. R. arkansana Girty Brachiopod, indet.
Fossils (U.S. Geol. Survey collections 16722, 16724, 16726, 16727, 16729, and 16730) collected in small

fault blocks from six other widely sc.attered localities in the upper part of the Woodman are given below:
Zaphrentites sp. Cladochonus sp. Rhopalolasma cf. R. sympecta Hudson Crinoid columnals Productella hirsutiformis Walcott Rhipidomella aff. R. arkansana Girty Schizophoria sp. Spirifer sp. Striatifera brazeriana (Girty) Productid brachiopod, indet.
The most common species in these collections is Productella hirsutiformis Walcott, which, according to Gordon (1957, written communication), is a facies fossil that is commonly found in calcareous shale, sjltstone and impure limestone·. The above fossils indicate a Late Mississippian age (Gordon, 1957, written communication).
The unfossiliferous lower part of the Woodman formation in the Dugway Range is probably also Late. Mississippian, inasmuch as fossils of this age were found just above the base of the Woodman formation in the Gold Hill district (Nolan, 1935, p. 28).
The fauna of the Woodman formation does not differ greatly from that of the overlying Ochre Mountain limestone. Even wlth the much larger collections from the Gold Hill district, Girty (Nolan, 1935, p. 28, 30) noted that he could not easily distinguish between the fauna of the two formations. Hence, the older Upper Mississippian rocks of the Dugway Range are correlated with the Woodman formation of the Gold Hill district chiefly on the basis of their stratigraphic position directly above the Madison limestone equivalent and their lithologic similarity to the Woodman of the Gold Hill district. The Woodman in both areas consists of a lower part of reddish-brown calcareous siltstone and fine-grained sandstone, and ari · upper part of silty limestone.
The lack of distinct faunal zones within the Woodman formation prevents positive correlation with beds containing the same faunas in other formations. Thus, correlation of the Woodman with other formations depends on the general Late Mississippian age, the. stratigraphic position within this epoch, and. to a lesser extent on lithology. The Woodman formation is tentatively correlated with the Deseret limestone and the Humbug formation of the East Tintic Mountains (Morris and Lovering, 1961, p. 93-107), of the Stockton and Fairfield quadrangles (Gilluly, 1932, p. 26, 28-29), and of the Cottonwood~American Fork area (Calkins and Butler, 1943, p. 26-28).

70 GEOLOGY AND MINERAL DEPOSITS, THOMAS AND DUGWAY "RANGES, UTAH

OCHRE MOUNTAIN LIMESTONE (UPPER MISSISSIPPIAN) is only partly exposed. On the east side of Bullion

The Ochre Mountain limestone was named by Nolan (1935, p. 29-31) from exposures on Ochre Mountain in the Gold Hill mining district. Rocks of somewhat similar lithology are found in the northern part of the Dugway Range, where they overlie the Woodman formation. The Ochre Mountain limestone is exposed in the mapped area only within 1Y2 miles of the northern bor~r (pl. 1) where it occurs chiefly in isolated fault blocks. The basal beds in depositional contact on the Woodman ·formation are exposed in two small areas along the east side of Bullion Canyon. The largest and best exposed outcrop of the Ochre Mountain is 2,900 feet long by 1,400 feet wide and is at the northwest end of Kellys Hole. (fig. 48). Other exposures are along the northeast side of Kellys Hole, in the conspicuous valley· northeast of Kellys Hole, and on the hills west of the Four Metals mine.
Litlwlogy.-A description of the Ochre Mountain

Canyon only 40 feet of this unit is found overlying the Woodman formation. The other outcrops of the Ochre Mountain occur in fault blocks, and the thickness in the largest exposure, measured near the east e~ge of the outcrop in Kellys Hole, is 470 feet. .Inasmuch as Nolan (1935, p. 30) estimated the thickness of the Ochre Mountain limestone in the Gold Hill district to be approximately 4,500 feet, probably only a small part of this formation is exposed in the Dugway Range.
Age and correlation.-Fossils are fairly common in certain beds in the Ochre Mountain limestone. The eight collections made in this formation were examined by Mackenzie Gordon, Jr., W. J. Sando, and Helen Duncan. U.S. Geol. Survey collection 16719 made between 23 and 33 feet above the base on the ridge top 0.2 mile northeast of the head of Bul1ion Canyon contained the following:

These fossils indicate that the rocks from which they were collected are Late Mississippian in age. Gordon (1957, written communication) stated that "Striatifera brazeriana (Girty), Diotyoolostttts cf. D. ilnflatus (McChesney), and Spirifer aff. S. brazerianus Girty are likely to be found in the middle and upper parts of the Upper Mississippian, and not in the lower part." Sando (1957, written comm1:1nication) noted that the corals described above are typical of the corals described by Parks (1951, p. 171-186) from the "Brazer limestone," 8 to 12 miles southeast of Logan, Utah.
The difficulties in distinguishing the faunas of tl1e Woodman formation from those of the Ochre l\1ountain limestone were pointed out in the section on the Woodman formation (p. 69). The Ochre Mountain limestone p~obably correlates most closely with the Great Blue limestone of the Stockton and Fairfield quadrangles (Gilluly, 1932, p. 29-31) and the East Tintic Mountains (Morris and Lovering, 1961, p. 107-113).
ORIGIN OF THE PALEOZOIC DOLOMITES
The origin of dolomite is a much discussed problem for which numerous theories have been advanced. One of the most complete summaries on the subject was made by Van Tuyl (1916, p. 257-420), who discussed eight possible methods of origin. Dolomites of the Thomas and Dugway Range can be divided roughly into two genetic classes-those formed prior to uplift from the sea bottom and those formed subsequent to uplift.
The dolomites formed prior to uplift in the Thomas and Dugway Ranges could have resulted from direct chemical precipitation, alteration of original limestone while it was still in the sea, or deposition of detrital dolomite reworked from previously existing dolomites. Whether direct chmnical precipitation formed any of these dolomites is not known. The Sevy dolomite, however,. suggests a chemical precipitate because of its widespread homogeneity, dense aphanitic character, and thin laminations. In some

of the other dolomites the presence of local crossbedding, piles of fossil debris, thick-shelled fossils, and local unconformities suggests shallow water deposition and reworking of the bottom sediments by waves. Nolan (1935, p. 22) pointed out that the dolo-
amites in the Gold Hill district were for the most part
formed in shallow-water environment, and Raymond (1925, p. 168) has briefly noted the common association of dolomite with diastems and unconformities. The detrital character of some of the dolomite in the Thomas and Dugway Ranges may. be due either to reworking of sediments by the waves or to deposition of sediments derived from elsewhere. In the latter case the sediments could have been either dolomite or limestone which was changed to dolomite shortly after being redeposited. The genesis of dolomite by alteration of limestone, probably during reworking of the original sediment by wave action in shallow water, is favored by us for most of the dolomites :formed prior to uplift. Nolan (1935, p. 22) believed that the dolomites in the Gold Hill region, with the exception of those in the Abercrombie formation and the conglomerates near the base of the Sevy dolomite, were formed in this manner. In the Thomas and Dugway Ranges, the Dugway Ridge, Fish Haven, Flc:>ride, Bell Hill, Harrisite, Lost Sheep, Thursday, and Gilson dolomites, the dolomite of the Goshoot, and lower part of the Hanauer formations, and some of the dolomite in the Engelmann formation were probably formed during reworking in the sea.
Formation of dolomite prior to uplift does not mean that limestone units cannot occur in some places in the dolomite. Such limestone would probably occur in definite lenses which could be traced laterally for as much as several miles. A limestone bed in the upper part of the Fish Haven dolomite on the southern part of Spor Mountain appears to be a lens of this type. This limestone unit, which is about 70 feet thick, can be traced in various fault blocks from 3,700 feet south of the Floride mine to at least 2,000 feet north of iL A 40- to 60-foot bed of limestone believed to be of similar origin occurs in the upper part of the Goshoot formation and extends for about a mile along the north side of Engelmann Canyon. Smaller lenslike bodi~s of limestone only a few· hundred feet long are f~und near the base of the Goshoot formation in the Black Rock Hills and in the upper part of the Gilson dolomite on the ridge north of Hanauer Canyon..
Much of the dolomite, particularly in the Dugway Range, was formed after uplift and probably by hydrothermal sohitions. Criteria for distinguishing this

72 GEOLOGY AND MINERAL DEPOSITS, THOMAS AND DUGWAY RANGES, UTAH

type of dolomite might include (1) steep crosscutting

of limestone beds by dolomite, (2) sharp or grada-

tional changes along strike of beds, (3) islands of

limestone in dolomite and vice versa, (4) mottling of

limestone in which the mottled patches are dolomitic,

(5) change to dolomite across fractures, and (6)

association of dolomite with faults. Dolomites show-

ing some of the above featur.es are noted in the Dug-

way Range and in part of the Black Rock Hills, and

include dolomites in the Cambrian Fandangle, Lamb,

Straight Canyon, and Fera formations; the Ordovi-

cian Garden City formation; the Upper Devonian

sedimentary rocks, undivided; parts of the Devonian

Engelmann formation; and the Mississippian Madi-

son limestone equivalent and Woodman formation.

These rocks were all formerly limestones, and many

were altered after most of the deformation of the

area took place.

In the Dugway Range hydrothermally dolomitized

rock is most common in the western and northern

parts-north of Castle Mountain and west of Bullion

Canyon and the Buckhorn thrust fault. In this re-

gion large areas of such sedimentary rocks as the

Fandangle limestone, Fera limestone, Garden City

formation, and Madison limestone equivalent have

been dolomitized. In many· of these areas the for-

mations are extremely difficult to distinguish from.

each other and from other formations which are nor-

mally dolomite. Dolomitized rock in the Dugway

Range is least common along the steep eastern face

of the range. In this area only the Lamb dolomite

and parts of the Straight Canyon formation are dolo-

mitized. The Lamb is mainly dolomite, but in some

areas it contains dark-gray and black limestone

patches. Nolan. (1935, .p. 22) _believed the Lamb in

the Gold Hill district to have been altered to dolo-

mite in shallow water shortly after original deposi-

tion. In the Dugway. Range, however, the change

from limestone to dolomite commonly takes place on

small breaks, and in this area the rocks were dolo-

mitized subsequent to uplift.

In the Black Rock Hills hydrothermally dolomitized

rocks are found most commonly in the undivided

Upper Devonian sedimentary rocks; they also occur

in the lower part of the Engelmann formation.

At some places in the Dugway Range and the

Black Rock Hills, limestone traced along strike is

Stippled area to left is yellow-gray-weathering doloiii!ite which becomes orange-gray toward contact with limestone. Limestone on right is gray. Note partial control of dolomitization by fracture in center of sketch, tendency of dolomite to spread laterally along bedding planes, and obliteration of bedding in dolomitlzed rock.
the reverse is true. Limestone with mottled color patches is commonly the first result of dolomitization, and in some places the central darker patches ar:e dolomite and the rest is limestone.
The transformation from limestone to dolomite is generally accompanied by changes in color, texture, and bedding. The dolomite may be either darker or lighter than the original limestone. In general the textural change is from fine-grained and smoothweathering limestone to medium-grained dolomite that has a sandy texture on weathered surfaces. The bedding of the dolomite tends to be thicker than that of the limestone and, as in some places in the Straight Canyon and Garden City formations, can be traced along strike from thin-bedded limestone into thickbedded or massive dolomite. An example of several of these characteristi~s is shown in figure 17, where thin~bedded limestone is altered first to sandy-textured mottled limestone and then to massive dolomite.
Probably the most diagnostic feature in distinguish-
ing dolomites formed prior to uplift from those formed after uplift is their relation to faults. In
the mapped area dolomitized rock is most common and ~ost thoroughly altered adjacent to faults. Along the east side of the Dugway Range dolomitized rock
is rare in the Fandangle limestone, but at one place it occurs in a small area adjacent to the north side of the fault cutting across Shadscale Canyon. These
relations are also clearly seen in the Fandangle lime-

liewett (1928, p. 856) discuss~d the relation of hy-

drothermally dolomitized rock to ore bodies, and noted

that it is most commonly found near lead-zinc depos-

its. Lovering (1949, p. 21-24) in discussing the al-

teration in the East Tintic mining district cited dolo-

mitization of the limestone and chloritization of the

rhyolite as the first stage of hydrothermal alteration.

l-Ie pointed out that s'ome formations, like the Cole

Canyon dolomite,_ change abruptly to limestone north

of a large fault. In the East Tintic district the area

of dolomitized rock is many times larger than that

containing ore. Lovering believed that the fluids pro-

ducing ore followed the same main channels as those

which. produced the dolomitized rock but branched

out near the surface, in part following old channels

and in part new ones. Gilluly (1932, p. 110-111)

reported a small amount of hydrothermal dolomite

adjacent to the Ophir Hill Consolidated mine, a lead-

silver-zinc-copper deposit in the Stockton and Fair-

field quadrangles.

The areas of most intensely dolomitized rock in the

Dugway Range are chiefly west of the Buckhorn

thrust fault and include the mines of the Dugway

district. Although all the mines are within this area

of most intensely dolomitized rock, not all the lime-

stones in this area have been dolomitized; and some

ore bodies, such as the one at the Francis mine,· are in

limestone.

ROCKS OF TERTIARY AGE
VOLCANIC ROCKS
Volcanic rocks compose more than 50 percent of the bedrock in the Thomas and Dugway Ranges. The main mass of volcanic rocks makes up the entire eastern part of the Thomas Range ·and extends for

5lj2 miles northward into the Dugway Range. Small intr11sions and flows are also found in and around Spor Mountain, the Dugway Range, and the Black Rock Hills. The Keg Mountains to the east of the mapped area and the unmapped part of the Black ·Rock Hills to the west consist chiefly of volcanic rocks; some volcanic rocks also occur to the south in the Drum Mountains.
The volcanic rocks may· be divided according to their mode of emplacement into lava flows, intrusions, and pyroclastics. In composition they are predominantly rhyolitic, but in minor part rhyodacitic. They are divided on the basis of age into an older and ·a younger group. The younger group forms the upper part of the main or eastern part of the Thomas Range; the older group underlies the younger unconformably and forms low hills in the flats adjacent to the higher mountains (fig. 18). The rocks of the younger group are well exposed, and the relations between its constituent rocks are clear, but the rocks of the older group are poorly exposed and their relations to one another are in part obscure. The marked unconformity separating the two groups is an old erosion surface that has considerable relief in some places. Although this unconformity is quite striking in many places, it is commo.nly obscured by alluvium. Near the center of The Dell this unconformity is near the valley floor, but about a mile farther north it is about 500 feet higher. Near the Autunite No. 8 claim several narrow gullies on the old land surface have been filled with white vitric tuff of the younger. group, and the original dips of the tuff beds on the two sides of the gully form a small syncline. About 300 feet west of this point the vitric tuff contains large boulders of the black glass welded tuff of the older group.
Distinct flow structure in lavas and bedding in tuffs ·are fairly common in the volcanic rocks of the younger group but much less so in those of the older group. Although flow laminae in rhyolite of the younger group are commonly bent and in places are highly contorted, the general attitude of the rocks is rela-
tively flat. Local steeponings of the attitude of the volcanic rocks are due to the irregularities of the surface on which the younger volcanics were deposited. In the older group, on the other hand, there are some fairly steep dips that are due to deformation; near Spor Mountain, flow laminae in porphyritic rhyolite and bedding planes in welded tuff strike from N. 50° E. to N. 45° E. and dip from 29° to· 47° NvV. Inasmuch as these strikes and dips are similar to those of Paleozoic rocks exposed nearby, the old volcanic rocks probably were tilted at the same

mostly crystal tuffs, whereas those of the younger group are almost all vitric, and welded tuffs occurs mainly in the older group. Exceptions do occur, however: in some small areas thin layers of vitric tuff are interbedded with the crystal tuffs of the older group, and small discontinuous areas or layers of welded vitric tuffs occur in the younger group. Coarsely porphyritic rhyolite occurs mainly in the older group, and nonporphyritic rhyolite in the younger group; however, in some places, such as the north end of the Thomas Range, there is gray rhyolite in the younger group that is so distinctly porphyritic as to be hard to distinguish from the older porphyritic rhyolite. Although glass units are present in both groups, they are quite rare in the older rocks.
The difference in texture between the highly porphyritic rhyolite prevalent in the older group and the nonporphyritic rhyolite prevalent in the younger group may be due in part to mo(le of emplacement; the porphyritic rhyolite is intrusive, and the nonporphyritic rhyolite is mostly extrusive.
The older volcanic group consists mainly of the more coarsely crystalline rocks, including rhyodacite, porphyritic rhyolite, and crystal tuff, whereas the younger group consists mainly of nonporphyritic rocks, including aphanitic rhyolite, vitric tuff, volcanic breccia, and glass.

tative mineral composition, or mode. But because virtually all the volcanic rocks in the Thomas and Dugway Ranges consist in large part of glassy or mi- · crocrystalline groundmass, modal analyses of them would give only the composition of the phenocrysts, which generally differs widely from that of the rock as a whole. A rhyodacite, for example, may contain no phenocrysts of either potassium feldspar or quartz, although a chemical analysis would . show that the

time as the Paleozoic rocks and before the younger volcanics were erupted.
The rocks of the older and younger volcanic groups have certain similarities. Both groups are mainly rhyolitic in composition; both include lavas, tuffs, and intrusive rocks. Some of the rhyolites and rhyolitic tuffs in one group are very similar to rocks of the same classes in the other group. In general, however, the two groups have distinctive differences. All the

groundmass contains enough potassium and silicon to have formed both minerals in abundance if the rock had been holocrystalline. In other words the norm of the rock, which can be calculated from the chemical analysis, more accurately portrays the true composition of the rock than does the mode.
The volcanic rocks are classified in this paper by a system based on chemical analyses proposed by Rittmann (1952, p. 75-100). He prefixed the word "dark"

rock in which at least seven-eighths of the total feldspar as indicated by the chemical analyses is sanidine, anorthoclase, or albite.
The pyroclastic rocks are classified texturally according to the proposal by Wentworth and Williams (1932, p. 45-53) .
In estimating the anorthite percentage of plagioclase phenocrysts from extinction angles, measurements were confined so far as possible to sharply twinned grains having some clearly identifiable orientation. These included Carlsbad-albite twins, albitepericline twins, and sections virtually normal to the a axis. Crump and ICetner's curve (Emmons and others, 1953, fig. 6) was used for combined albitepericline twins, Wright's (Rogers and ICerr, 1933, p. 212) for combined Carlsbad-albite twins, and Wahlstrom's. (1947, p. 73) for plagiocl~se microlites. As shown by Crump and ICetner, the results obtained by such measurements can be statistically accurate only to about -+-10 percent.
OLDER VOLCANIC GROUP
GENERAL FEATURES
Although the older volcanic group has a much smaller area of exposure than the younger, 10 units were distinguished in the older group as compared with only five in the younger. The rock types in the older group are rhyodacite and dark labradorite-rhyodacite, rhyodacite breccia and associated tuffs, plagioclase crystal tuff, black glass welded tuff, sanidine crystal tuff, quartz-sanidine crystal tuff, vitric tuff, red vitric tuff with associated conglomerate and sandstone, porphyritic rhyolite, and intrusive breccia.
The rocks of the older group are exposed here and there throughout the Thomas and Dug~vay Ranges, but only the rhyodacite and th~ porphyritic rhyolite are widely distributed. The red vitric tuff, with the associated conglomerate and sandstone, is found only in scattered outcrops within a northeast-trending band approximately 3 miles long in the southern part of the Dugway Range; the plagioclase crystal tuff is limited to a northwest-trending band a.Jong the north-. eastern part of the Thomas Range and in the adj acent part of the ICeg Mountains; the black glasswe1ded tuff is found only in the vicinity of the Autunite No. 8 property. The sanidine crystal tuff occurs only at the south end of the Thomas Range, and the rhyodacite breccia and associated tuffs in the northwest corner of the Dugway Range. The quartzsanidine crystal tuff is found in the central part of The Dell and at the northeast end of the Thomas Range.
712-190 0-64-6

As already noted, most of the volcanic rocks in the older group crop out only in comparatively small areas. One reason for this fact, no doubt, is that these rocks are partly covered by volcanic rocks of the younger group, Lake Bonneville sediments, and overburden. It appears possible, however, that some of these rocks never covered large areas, that is, that some were formed as small intrusive bodies and that some were extruded over small areas from a single center or at most a few centers.
Because of their small areal extent and poor exposures, the relations between the rocks of the older volcanic group are not fully known.
RHYODACITE AND DARK LABRADORITE-RHYODACITE
Two types of volcanic rocks containing pyroxene and a median plagioclase are found in the Thomas Range. According to Rittmann's classification (1952, p. 95) these rocks are rhyodacite and dark labradoriterhyodacite. The former contains conspicuous lathshaped phenocrysts of plagioclase and only a few small pyroxene crystals; the latter contains abundant phenocrysts of dark-green pyroxene and no visible plagioclase; Chemically the dark labradorite-rhyodacite differs from the rhyodacite in having a higher content of MgO, FeO, and CaO and a lower content of Si02, Al20a, Na20, and K20.
Occurrence and relation~-The dark labradoriterhyodacite is much less conimon than the rhyodacite and crops out only as a dike 120 feet long by 4 to 5 feet wide in the Black Rock Hills, and in 5 small areas of lava or intrusive rock near Spor Mountain. The largest of these areas, which is only 700 feet long by 280 feet wide, lies 5,000 feet south of the Bell Hill mine. Two of the other areas lie 3,200 to 3,500 feet south and southwest of the Bell Hill mine. Another is on the Harrisite property, and the fifth is 500 feet northwest of E.agle Rock Ridge.
The rhyodacite is widespread, occurring in both the Thomas and Dugway Ranges. In the Thomas Range it crops out in four main areas: (1) in the Black Rock Hills, where in addition to the small patches shown on the map (pl. 1), it covers a large tract northwest of the mapped area, (2) adjacent to Eagle Rock Ridge, (3) along the south end of Spor Mountain, and (4) along the south end of the eastern part of the Thom~s Range. The last occurrence is at the north end of a belt containing scattered outcrops of rhyodacite that extends into the central part of the Drum Mountains. It also crops out in two smaller areas, one 6,500 feet southwest and one 600 feet north of Spor Mountai~. In the Dugway Range, rhyodacite crops out in three main areas: (1) along

76 GEOLOGY AND MINERAL DEPOSITS, THOMAS AND DUGWAY RANGES, UTAH

·the east edge of the volcanic rocks in the southern part of the range, (2) in scattered areas from the head of Green Grass Valley northward along Fandangle Canyon, .and (3) along the Buckhorn fault between Bullion and Engelmann Canyons. There are also a number of small dikes of this rhyodacite in the northern part of the Dugway Range, but because these dikes weather more readily than the country rock, their position in most places is marked only by scattered pieces of float. Several of these small dikes are exp·osed irt the workings of the Buckhorn mine.
The rhyodacite and dark labradorite-rhyodacite generally form small rounded hills, which are commonly surrounded by alluvium. The relation between the two rock types is unknown, and their relation to other rocks, especially the volcanic rocks in the Thomas Range, is hard to determine. In several small outcrops north of Spor Mountain, however, altered rhyodacite is cut by dikes of porphyritic rhyolite (fig. 19). In the southern part of the Dugway Range,
FIGURE 19.-Rhyodaclte (dark gray) Intruded by white porphyritic rhyolite, edge of main wash, 1.4· miles west-southwest of Wildhorse Spring.
rhyodacite probably cuts Cambrian sedimentary rocks and underlies gray porphyritic rhyolite of the older volcanic group and green glass of the younger valcame group.
There is evidence in several places that the rhyodacite and dark labradorite-rhyodacite are intrusive. A contact of the dark labradorite-rhyodacite with the Lost Sheep dolomite exposed in trenches on the Harrisite property at the south end of Spor Mountain dips 60° to 90°. This steep dip, together with the oval outline of the outcrop (pl. 1), suggests that at this place this rock is a small plug. A small plug of rhyodacite cuts dolomite along a steep-sided gulch

1,200 feet southeast of the main workings on the Harrisite property. Some of the outcrops of rhyodacite adjacent to Spor Mountain and in Fandangle Canyon and Green Grass Valley show linear alinement along ·conspicuous faults; rhyodacite, commonly brecciated, also crops out along the Buckhorn thrust fault. These relations seem to indicate that this rhyodacite was intruded along fissures, but some of it may have reached the surface and formed small flows.
Lithology.-Both the rhyodacite and dark labradorite-rhyodacite weather dark rusty brown but are dark gray to dark grayish brown on fresh fracture. Both contain 15 to 50 percent phenocrysts, as much as 5 mm long, in a brown glass groundmass. In the dark labradorite-rhyodacite, however, most of the phenocrysts are pyroxene and a few are quartz, whereas in the rhyodacite most of the phenocrysts are of plagioclase and some are of pyroxene. The pyroxenes in the dark labradorite-rhyodacite are generally enstatite and augite, though hypersthene was found in one specimen. In the rhyodacite the pyroxenes are hypersthene and augite.
In the dark labradorite-rhyodacite the augite and enstatite are about equal in abundance, though locally either may be 2 to 3 times as abundant as the other. Many of the augite crystals are twinned and some are distinctly zoned. The quartz phenocrysts may constitute as much as 3 percent of the rock; they are anhedral, commonly embayed, and in a few places surrounded by dark reaction rings. Plagioclase phenocrysts were noted in a few thin sections; they are small, ragged, and lath-shaped, and commonly zoned. The plagioclase in the one thin section in which measurements were obtained is labradorite (An56 ). Other minerals that form small phenocrysts in some of the rocks are magnetite, biotite partly altered to hematite, and hornblende.
The groundmass consists of a felted mass of plagioclase microlites in a brown glass commonly containing small particles of magnetite. The composition of the microlites in the individual thin sections ranged from
An59 to An12· The dike in the Black Rock Hills is different from
the rock described above, in being finer grained, in having fewer phenocrysts, in having a diabasic texture, and in containing many small ellipsoid-shaped vesicles as much as 0.1 inch in diameter, some o£ which are filled with calcite. The phenocrysts, which make up only 4 percent of this rock, consist entirely of subhedral to euhedral crystals of enstatite; no augite is present in this rock. The groundmass contains crystals of enstatite and magnetite and microlites o£ plagioclase, together with glass.

GENERAL GEOLOGY

77

In the rhyodacite, plagioclase crystals make up 14 to 38 percent of the rock and those of pyroxene from less than 1 to 14 percent. The plagioclase phenocrysts are subhedral to · euhedral crystals, which in thin section show well-developed albite twins and are commonly zoned. Their anorthite content, determined in ·19 thin sections, ranges from An33 to An64; the average is An54• The plagioclase phenocrysts in specimens from the Dugway Range are commonly highly altered . and largely replaced by clay and potassium feldspar. The most abundant pyroxene is generally hypersthene. Phenocrysts of hypersthene constitute as much as 10 percent of some specimens, though in some they are very scarce. They are subhedral to euhedral and are easily recognized by their parallel extinction and light-pink to light-green pleochroism. Augite is somewhat less abundant in most places but not everywhere; it locally makes up as much as 7 percent of the rock. It occurs in subhedral to euhedral phenocrysts which in some specimens are twinned. In the rhyodacite from the Dugway Range the augite is the varietal form pigeonite and has a 2V of only a few degrees (fig. 20) . Hornblende was noted in two specimens, one from the Black Rock Hills and the other from the southern border of the mapped area. It constitutes as much as 4 percent of the specimen in the latter pla~e and forms dark-green euhedral phenocrysts as much as half an inch long. A trace of biotite was also found in this specimen, and biotite makes up several percent of some specimens from Green Grass Valley in the Dugway Range (fig. 20). Small rounded anhedra of magnetite occur in almost all specimens and make up as much as 2 percent of some thin sections. Minute quantities of apatite were found in some specimens.
The groundmass of this rhyodacite consists of a felted mass of plagioclase microlites in light-brown glass. The average composition of the microlites in all the individual thin sections except one is An48An53 (in one slide it was An23 ). The microlites are thus less calcic than the phenocrysts.
Chemical composition.-The fact that the. refractive index of the brown glass groundmass of both rock types was less than that of balsam suggests the presence of considerable occult potassium feldspar in the groundmass. In order to check the potassium content, sawed sections from which thin sections were cut were stained with a cobaltinitrite solution according to the method of Gabriel and Cox (1929, p. 290292). The results indicated that the groundmass of all specimens -is high in potassium. Chemical analyses (table 15, nos. 1, 2, and 3) of one specimen of dark

labradorite-rhyodacite from the rock exposed on the Harrisite property and two specimens of rhyodacite from the south end of Eagle Rock Ridge and south of the eastern part of the Thomas Range support this conclusion. The two specimens of rhyodacite, though collected 4% miles apart, are as similar in composition as two specimens from the same outcrop usually are. The norms of the three specimens contain from 26 to 30 percent orthoclase and from 12 to 22 percent quartz.
RHYODACITE BRECCIA AND ASSOCIATED TUFFS
Occurrence and relations.-The rhyodacite breccia and associated tuffs are found in isolated patches in the northwest corner of the Dugway Range (pl. 1), where the largest area underlain by a body of these rocks is 5,000 feet long and as much as 800 feet wide in the central and eastern parts of Kellys Hole. Smaller exposures are in the northwest corner of Kellys Hole, 3,400 feet west of the Four Metals mine; about 1,000 feet northwest of the Bertha mine; and 11,000 feet southeast of the Four Metals mine, just east of the Buckhorn thrust fault. There are several other scattered outcrops to the north of the mapped

78 GEOLOGY AND MINERAL DEPOSITS, THOMAS AND DUGWAY RANGES, UT~

area just inside the Dugway Proving Ground SW quadrangle.
The rhyodacite breccia and associated tuffs are easily eroded in most places, and known masses probably are only remnants of a body that at one time covered a much larger area. WithiJ?- the area mapped these rocks are now confined to low, flat areas such as the Kellys Hole and Bertha grabens, where erosion has been slower than on the steep mountain sides. To the north of the mapped area, however, this rock caps a prominent hill, 3,100 feet N. 52° W. of the Four Metals mine, being there well cemented and resistant.
In the area mapped, these pyroclastic rocks all rest on rocks of Late Devonian and Late Mississippian age and, being nowhere in contact with the other volcanic rocks, their relations to them are unknown. They are here included, on the basis of composition, in the older volcanic group because this group contains all the other rhyodacite in the Thomas and Dugway Ranges.
Lithology.-The most abundant rock in this unit is a dark greenish-brown poorly sorted and unstratified breccia, as much as 85 percent of which consists of rhyodacite fragments embedded- in a dense ashy matrix. The fragments, which are generally angular, are mostly about 1;10 inch to 11j2 feet across; in most areas, however, they are all less than 1 inch across. Although the fragments are generally somewhat altered, they can be seen in thin section to contain considerable plagioclase in. long rectangular laths. The average composition of the plagioclase is about An47 (calcic andesine) . Small amounts of altered pyroxene (at least in part augite) have also been identified, together with a little chlorite, calcite, and magnetite. In addition to the fragments of rhyodacite a few of siltstone have been noted. Crystal fragments make up :from 2 to 10 percent· of the rock; these consist chiefly o:f quartz and sanidine, but include minor amounts of plagioclase, magnetite, and hematite. The matrix of the breccia is partly glassy. but consists in part of very fine grains. Its dark color and the presence of plagioclase microlites suggest that it is rhyodacitic in composition.
The tuffs generally occur in small isolated poorly exposed outcrops, but on the prominent hill just north of the rnapped area they can be seen to be interbedded with the breccia. They are of several types. Some, especially north of the rnapped area, are dark brown and appear to be made up of small rhyodacite fragments. Most in the mapped area are light tan to light gray and contain considerable quartz
and sanidine. Much of-the tuffs are very fine grained,

and in the southeast end of Kellys Hole the only min-

erals recognizable in them are quartz and a smaller

amount of calcite. They are well stratified, and this

fact, together with the presence of much well-rounded

quartz and of some calcite cement, strongly suggests

they are waterlaid.

The occurrence of the coarser grained rocks to the .

west and to the north suggests that the vent ·from

which the material came was to the northwest, prob-

ably. in the adjoining Dugway Proving Ground SW

quadrangle.

·

PLAGIOCLASE CRYSTAL TUFF

Occurrence and relations.-A northwest-trending band 15,000 feet in length, along the northeast edge of the Thomas Range, .contains a .series . of small isolated exposures of plagioclase crystal tuff. This band extends from just south of the large fault which passes south of Bittner Knoll to the easternmost extension of the Thomas Range (pl. 1) . Outcrops of this same rock are also found in the l{eg Mountains, which lie just east of the quadrangle.
The plagioclase crystal tuff crops out on low knolls surrounded by Lake Bonneville sediments. At one place near the east end of the Thomas Range, however, this tuff overlies Prospect Mountain quartzite and contains large fragments of quartzite and limestone. In the Keg Mountains the tuff is overlain by rhyolite of the younger volcanic group. In some localities it shows a distinct bedding that dips from 13° W. to 61° E. The relations of this rock to other volcanic rocks are not fully known, but the following evidence is believed to indicate that it is a member of the older volcanic group: (1) the abundance of crystals in the tuff, (2) its position directly overlying the Paleozoic rocks and below the rhyolites known to belong to the younger group, and (3) its locally steep dips.
Lithology.-The plagioclase crystal tuff varies in color through white, gray, brownish gray, light greenish gray, and pale red purple. It is a compact, wellindurated rock that contains from 20 to 45 percent crystals-chiefly white grains of plagioclase with lesser amounts of biotite-in a dense ashy matrix. In some outcrops the tuff appears massive, but in others it is slabby and forms layers from 1j2 to 2 inches thick. Rock fragments are common near its base, but in most outcrops they are rare.
In thin section the plagioclase is seen to make up from 15 to 30 percent of the rock and to form subhedral to euhedral crystals that are commonly zoned (fig. 21) . These crystals are from 6.5 to 0.5 mm long and 2.0 to 0.2 mm broad., The average anorthite content has a range from about An5a to Ana4, which cor-

few scattered microlites. In some places it contains microscopic cavities. The index of refraction of the glass is less than that of balsam, and stain tests (Gabriel and Cox, 1929, p. 290-292) have shown it to contain considerable potassium. This fact, together with the presence of numerous labradorite crystals, suggests that the plagioclase crystal tuff has the chemical composition of rhyodacite.

SANIDINE CRYSTAL TUFF

responds to labradorite. All the crystals are fractured and are partially replaced along a fine network of fractures which commonly follow cleavage planes. The replacing material differs from place to palce; it consists mainly of calcite and clay minerals, but in one slide it appeared to be potassium feldspar. Biotite occurs in thick pseudohexagonal books, ranging from 0.2 to 2.0 mm in diameter. It contains numerous inclusions, chiefly of plagioclase. In some thin sections green and red-brown biotite were noted (fig. 21), both partly altered to hematite or magnetite. Magnetite, in small rounded anhedra, makes up from 1 to 2 percent of every thin section of these rocks. Sphene, largely replaced by calcite, was noted in some thin sections. Calcite, some of it irregularly replacing other minerals and some of it forming distinct rhombohedrons, can constitute as much as 4 percent of the rock. Very small amounts of apatite and zircon were found in all specimens, and isolated crystals of quartz, sanidine, and topaz in single specimens. The crystals show parallel to subparallel alinement.
The crystal fragments are in a matrix of small fragments of brown ghtss. In some specimens this glass is entirely devitrified and in others contains only a

Occurrence and relations.-A crystal tuff containing abundant sanidine occurs in four areas at the south end of the Thomas Range (pl. 1) : (1) an area about 2,200 feet long by 1,500 feet wide, about a mile west of the mouth of Topaz Valley, (2) a small area about half a mile west of the mouth of Topaz Valley, (3) an elliptical area about 1,500 feet long by 150 feet wide crossed by the main east-west road just west of the southern tip of Antelope Ridge, and (4) a small area 7,500 feet west-northwest of the one last mentioned. The comparatively small area covered by this unit suggests that it was formed by explosion from a single vent in the southern part of the Thomas Range.
The sanidine crystal tuff forms rolling hills and rounded outcrops resembling those of porphyritic rhyolite. Little is known of the relations of this tuff to the other volcanic rocks of the older group. The largest area of outcrop is entirely surrounded by alluvium, and though the rocks to the north and west are vitric tuff and rhyolite of the younger volcanic group and those to the south and east are rhyodacite, the contacts are nowhere exposed.
Lithology.-The sanidine crystal tuff is a compact welded tuff, light gray to dark l:>rown on fresh fractures but dark brown on weathered surfaces. The rock also contains small fragments of ·dark glass, light-colored devitrified glass, and pumice in some places; one fragment of siltstone was found. Small
cavities are common in this tuff. Crystals, chiefly of sanidine, make up 20 to 70 percent of the rock, and are imbedded in a light-gray to brown ashy matrix.
One can see a distinct pyroclastic texture, shown largely by the many fractured crystals in thin sec-
tion. The sanidine, which makes up as much as 55 percent of this rock, is in euhedral crystals or frag-
ments of euhedral c-rystals, ranging in diameter from 0.15 mm to nearly 2 mm. Smaller enhedral to sub-
hedral crystals of andesine (An43 ) make up from 1 to 6 percent of the rock. Quartz constitutes about 5 percent of the rock; it forms rounded grains com~ monly rimmed with clay or sericite. Plates of green
and brown biotite make up 1 to 3 percent of the tuff.

80 GEOLOGY AND MINERAL DEPOSITS, THOMAS AND DUGWAY RANGES, UTAH

Still less abundant are magnetite, sphene, hornblende, and zircon.
The matrix of the crystals is a light-br'6wn homogeneous glass, vesicular in some places and containing some shards. Fractures in the glass are commonly lined with highly birefringent Clay minerals.
The sanidine crystal tuff is similar in mineralogy to the quartz-sanidine ~uff described in the following section, but it is compacted and generally contains about 10 times as much sanidine as quartz.
QUARTZ-SANIDINE CRYSTAL TUFF
Occurrence and relations.-A tuff containing abundant crystals of quartz as well as of sanidine is found mainly in scattered outcrops in the central part of The Dell and at the base of the steep scarp in the northeast part of the Thomas Range (pl. 1) .
The quartz-sanidine- -crystal tuff forms -rounded· hills, some several hundred feet high, in the fiats that bound the area underlain -by massive flows of the younger volcanic group. In most places the outcrops are surrounded by alluvium or Lake Bonneville sediments; in the northeast part of the Thomas Range, however, the tuff is unconformably overlain by rocks of the younger volcanic group, and in the vicinity of the Good Will property (fig.· 50) it is conformably overlain by vitric tuff of the older volcanic group. There are no well-exposed contacts between the quartzsanidine tuff and other members of the older volcanic group.
In most places the quartz-sanidine crystal tuff lacks internal structure, but in several outcrops north of Eagle Rock Ridge it has a distinct .bedding that strikes northeast and dips 35° to 47° NW. Inasmuch as this strike and dip are parallel to those of the Paleozoic sedimentary rocks on Spor Mountain, the tuff was probably tilted at the same time as the Paleozoic rocks, long before the eruption of the younger volcanic rocks. The ·crystal tuff exposed in The Dell and the northeastern part of the Thomas Range may be of the same age, for the two localities are on the same line of strike.
~ithology.-The quartz-sanidine crystal tuff is a white, pale to dark yellowish-brown, or grayish-red, generally well-compacted rock. About 25 to 75 percent consists of crystals, which are embedded in a dense aphanitic groundmass. The crystals· are chiefly clear quartz and sanidine, but a little biotite is visible in some specimens. Cavities, which may be as large as a half inch in diameter, are numerous in some areas. Some of this rock can be classified as a welded tuff, but the degree of welding varies from

place to place, and in general the lighter colored tuff is less consolidated than the darker. In the northeastern part of the Thomas Range white to pinkishwhite, moderately consolidated tuff grades into grayish-red tuff that is firmly welded. In The Dell hard brown welded tuff is interbedded with more friable white tuff. The differences in consolidation and welding are probably due to differences in the temperature of the particles. when they came to rest, and the darker colors of the more firmly welded tuffs may be due to more complete oxidation of the iron caused by higher temperature. At one .place in the central part of The Dell the fragments were apparently molten, and cooled so quickly that the .matrix became a black glass. A conspicuous layer of black glass, from: less than a foot to more than 75 feet thick, lies near the base of 'the largest exposure of this tuff, and can be .followed discontinuously northeastward for about 6,500 feet. At the Good Will property (fig. 50) friable crystal tuff grades upward into tuffaceous sandstone.
A few rock fragments, nearly all consisting of glass, pumice, or devitrified glass, are generally present in the quartz-sanidine crystal tuff, but in some places these fragments are absent and in others may make up as much as 10 percent of the rock. Although some of the fragments noted are an inch across, most are less than a quarter of an inch across. One piece of quartzite was· noted in a specimen from the outcrop by the road just east of the Fluorine Queen (fig. 50) .
As determined in thin sections (fig. 22), quartz crystals make up from about 15 to 50 percent of the rock and sanidine ·crystals from 10 to 40 percent. Although most of the mineral fragments in the tuff are bounded by fractures, the quartz is commonly in euhedral bipyramidal crystals, which weather out from the more friable tuff.
Many of the quartz crystals are broken and em-
bayed. The quartz grains range in diameter from
0.05 mm to 3.5 mm, and the sanidine grains from about 0.05 to 4.5 mm. Plagioclase crystals make up from less than 1 to about 15 percent of the rock and average about 5 percent. They are generally smaller than the quartz or sanidine crystals, having a maxi-

sphene are found in many specimens in smaller amounts, and apatite, topaz, fluorite, and calcite were noted in one or two specimens. The calcite partially replaces the feldspars.
The groundmass is a light- to dark-brown glass that is partly devitrified. It commonly contains shards (fig. 22), and in a few places it contains trichites or helonites. Small amounts of tridymite have been noted in a few sp.ecimens, and bands and spherulites of chalcedony in several.
0 hemical composition.-Chemical analysis (table 15, no. 4) indicates that the quartz-sanidine crystal tuff is rhyolitic in composition (Rittmann, 1952, p. 95). The norm contains more orthoclase and anorthite and less albite than that of the porphyritic rhyolite flows of the younger volcanic group. Although topaz is rare, the analysis indicates that this rock contains more fluorine than any other rock except the porphyritic rhyolite from the plug on Eagle Rock Ridge. The heavy-mineral fraction separated from a specimen of brown welded tuff contained only 0.01 percent fluorite. In view of the scarcity of fluorine-bearing mineral~ it appears likely that the fluorine is largely in the glassy matrix.

VITRIC TUFF
Occurrence {JJ1U], relations.-Relatively thin layers of vitric tuff, both unwelded and welded, occur in the older volcanic group at several widely scattered localities. The largest body is exposed in outcrops scattered over an area 3,500 feet long by 700 feet wide in the northern part of the . Thomas Range, about 1% miles south of the main east-west road connecting Callao with Vernon (pl. 1). Exposures several hundred feet long are common in The Dell near the Good Will property (fig. 50), and isolated exposures, too small to show on plate 1, occur in the flat just northeast of the Thomas Range and also a mile north-northeast of Dugway Pass in the Dugway Range.
The vitric tuff is best exposed in the northern part of the Thomas Range, where it forms low cliffs along the gently sloping sides of some ridges. At most other localities it is poorly exposed because it is friable and occurs in flat debris-coyered areas.
The rocks described in this section include all but one of the layers of vitric tuff in the older volcanic group, and these layers must differ in age. The age of the vitric tuff in the northern part of the Thomas Range is uncertain. This rock overlies porphyritic rhyolite of the older group and is overlain in turn by white vitric tuff of the younger volcanic group. The underlying vitric tuff, howev'llr, may itself belong to the younger group: It is welded, as is much of the older tuff, but it contains numerous lithic fragments, as does most of the tuff in the younger group.
Most of the vitric tuff here described, however, is of about the same age as the quartz-sanidine crystal tuff (p. 80). Vitric tuff more clearly of the older group, interbedded with quartz-sanidine crystal tuff, is exposed just southwest of Colored Pass and also near the Good Will property.
In the southern part of the Dugway Range, there is a narrow discontinuous layer of vitric tuff between rhyodacite and porphyritic rhyolite.
Lithology.-The vitric tuffs believed to be in the older volcanic group-other than the red one to be described later (p. 84)....:_are cream-colored, light- to medium-brown, moderate greenish-yellow, and palegreen rocks containing as much as 50 percent small angular to rounded fragments of glass in a dense ashy matrix. Most of these fragments are pumice, although in the welded tuff in the northern part of the Thomas Range they are more commonly devitrified
glass or parts of spherulites. Small crystals can be seen in thin sections, but they
nowhere make up more than 5 percent of the rock.

-82 GEOLOGY AND MINERAL DEPOSITS, THOMAS AN·D DUGWAY RANGES, UTAH
Most are either sanidine or quartz, but minor amounts of plagioclase, biotite, magnetite, and calcite are present in some places, and one thin section contains a few grains of altered pyroxene.
The matrix as seen in thin section is a brown glass, which is partly devitrified in the welded tuff. Some of the glass is commonly in shards.

PORPHYRITIC RHYOLITE
Occurrence and relations.-Porphyritic rhyolite is widely distributed in the Thomas and southern Dugway Ranges (pl. 1) . This rock is found generally either on the margins of the main mass of younger volcanic rocks or in valleys within that mass. The larger areas of outcrop are: (1) along the east margin of the volcanic rocks in the southern part of the Dugway Range, (2) in the north-central part of the Thomas Range, (3) at the northwest end of The Dell, (4) in the central part of The Dell, east of Eagle Rock Ridge, (5) along the southern and southeastern part of Spor Mountain, (6) at the south end of the Thomas Range, and (7) on the east side of the southern part of the Thomas Range, in the vicinity of the Autunite No. 8 claim. Many smaller areas occur in the eastern part of Thomas Range, on Spor Mountain, and in the southern part of the Dugway Range.
The porphyritic rhyolite forms rounded ridges or hills with as much as 700 feet relief. It is unconformably overlain by tuff, breccia, and rhyolite of the younger volcanic group (fig. 23A). The relations of the porphyritic rhyolite to other members of the older volcanic group are difficult to determine in most places. In the southern part of the Dugway Range, however, porphyritic rhyolite overlies rhyodacite, and at the north end of Spor Mountain small porphyritic rhyolite dikes cut the rhyodacite (fig. 19). At the Autunite No. 8 claim, the porphyritic rhyolite is apparently overlain by black glass-welded tuff (fig. 25). In the southeastern part of the Dugway Range it is underlain by a small bed of vitric tuff of the older volcanic group, but in the central part of The Dell it is probably overlain by a bed of the older vitric tuff. The relations of the porphyritic rhyolite to the quartz-sanidine crystal tuff, the sanidine crystal tuff, and the plagioclase crystal tuff are not known.
The porphyritic rhyolite unconformably overlies Cambrian limestone and dolomite in the southeastern part of the Dugway Range, and plugs and small dikes of the rhyolite cut Silurian dolomite on Spor Mountain. One of the larger plugs, an oval body 1,600 feet long by 750 feet wide near the south end of Spor Mountaip, is partly surrounded by a narrow

rim of glassy rock containing phenocrysts identical with those in the main mass. Other evidence of an intrusive origin for at least part of this rhyolite is the occurrence of two small volcanic necks on the flats at the southeast end of the Thomas Range (fig. 23B) . The central part of the southernmost neck (fig. 23B) forms a prominent spire of lighter color than the rhyolite surrounding it. Although much of the porphyritic rhyolite is clearly intrusive, some of it may be extrusive.
Lithology.-The porphyritic rhyolite is mostly light gray, but some is light brownish gray or pale brown. It contains 15 to 70 percent phenocrysts of sanidine, quartz, and plagioclase, in a matrix of glass. In some places where intrusive rhyolite magma has cooled quickly, as in the rim of the large plug in the southern part of Spor Mountain and in the outer

part of one of th~ small volcanic necks southeast of the Thomas Range, the matrix is black glass.
Sanidine generally forms the most numerous phenocrysts but varies widely in abundance; it makes up as little as 2 percent to as much as 55 percent of the rock. It is in anhedral to euhedral crystals that vary widely in size, even in the same thin section, but are · generally between 0.5 and 3.5 mm in diameter. Quartz makes up from 3 to 45 percent of the rock. It forms anhedral to euhedral crystals about 0.5 mm to 3.0 mm in diameter that in some places are embayed by the matrix. Plagioclase, in smaller crystals, makes up 1 to 15 percent of the rock. Its observed composition ranges from An4 to An45, but the overall composition of most crystals is between An20 and An43• Biotite, the chief dark mineral, occurs in ragged or 'welldeveloped crystals that may be very scarce or may constitute as much as 3 percent of the rock. Magnetite, which is always present but never forms more than 3 percent of the rock, generally occurs in small rounded or irregular grains. Small crystals of zircon and sphene are found in amounts of less than 1 percent in some specimens. Topaz is absent in most specimens, but is commonly present in the plugs on and around Spor Mountain (fig. 24) and forms as

much as 3 percent of one specimen. Hornblende, apatite, fluorite, and muscovite have been noted in a few specimens.
In thin section the groundmass is seen to be mainly clear light-brown or deep-brown glass, most of which contains small microlites and crystallites (belonites and trichites). In many places the glass has been partly or completely devitrified, and in some places the groundmass consists mostly of small spherulites. When the glass is clear, it contains perlitic cracks. Some specimens contain tridymite and a little cristohalite in minute grains that generally fill small cavities.
Most of the porphyritic rhyolite at the southeast end of the Thomas Range, from a point about 1.3 miles west of the mouth of Topaz Valley to a point 1 mile north of the Autunite No. 8 prospect, contains broken crystals and is texturally similar in many respects to a tuff, but it is regarded as a flow breccia for the following reasons: (1) In the vicinity of the Autunite No. 8 property the rock is made up of irregular and wedge-shaped pieces recemented with rhyolite of similar composition; (2) there are two small volcanic necks that consist of this rock ; (3) some thin sections contain broken crystals whose parts have ;moved only a small distance apart, as if their movement had been restricted by a viscous medium; (4) cracks in some crystals are filled with glass; (5) in some places no fracturing is visible; and (6) the glass commonly shows flow lines. Fracturing somewhat similar to that in this rock was observed by Minakami, Ishikawa, and Yagi (1951, p. 131-133) in the andesite of the active volcano Showa-Shinzan, a small roofed volcanic dome that was formed on the flank of the Usu volcano in 1944. The fresh lava exposed at the top of this dome is broken into irregular or wedge-shaped pieces, which those geologists believed to have been formed when lava that had consolidated early was fractured by upward movement of underlying still-fluid lava. Some brecciated porphyritic rhyolite in the southeastern part of the Thomas Range is probably of similar origin.
Chemical composition.-Chemical analyses were made (table 15, nos. 5 and 6) of two samples, one (no. 5) collected at the north end of Eagle Rock Ridge and the other (no. 6) 0.3 mile east of the Autunite No. 8 prospect; both analyses indicate that the rock has a rhyolitic composition, according to the classification of Rittmann (1952, p. 15). The two samples, however, show a greater difference in chemical composition than any two of the rhyolitic rocks in the younger volcanic group (table 15, nos. 7-16). The norm of no. 6 is higher in quartz, anorthite, and

84 GEOLOGY AND MINERAL DEPOSITS, THOMAS AND DUGWAY RANGES, UTAH

the iron oxides (magnetite, ilmenite, and hematite) and lower in orthoclase and albite, while that of no. 5 is lower in quartz, anorthite, and iron ·oxides and higher in albite than any rock of the younger group.
BLACK GLASS-WELDED TUFF
Occurrence and relations.-Black glass welded tuff is limited to three small areas in the southeastern part of the Thomas Range. One of these areas, 600 feet long by 450 feet wide, lies just north of the discovery pit on the Autunite No. 8 property (pl. 1); another·, 800 feet long.by 200 feet wide, is 1,500 feet S. 20° W. of this same pit, and the third, 200 feet long by 100 feet wide, is 500 feet west of the first.
This welded tuff is fairly well exposed on many small knolls. It rests on an irregular eroded surface cut on porphyritic rhyolite (fig. 25), and Is uncon-

crystals are zoned and range from about An45 to An57• Biotite makes up 4 to 5 percent of the rock and forms euhedral crystals 0.25 to 1.6 mm in length. Small anhedral grains of magnetite make up about 1 percent of the rock. A few small grains of quartz were noted in one slide, and very small quantities of apa- . tite and hornblende were observed. The groundmass consists of brown glass, largely in the form of shards. Some of the groundmass occurs as partly devitrified areas or bands and consist largely of spherulites. Small cavities in the rock are commonly filled with tridymite, and in some places with cristobalite.
The plagioclase phenocrysts in this tuff are similar to those of the plagioclase crystal tuff in the northeastern part of the Thomas Range, but this rock is distinguished from the other by its black glass matrix and elongate pumice fragments.

formably overlain by white vitric tuff of the younger group. Near the Autunite No. 8 discovery pit the vitric tuff fills a gully of northeasterly trend cut into the welded tuff. About 300 feet farther west there are boulders of the welded tuff in the lower part of the vitric tuff. The smallness of the area in which this welded tuff occurs suggests that it consists of material thrown out during one brief eruption from a single vent.
Lithology.-This welded tuff is a dark-brown to black glassy porphyritic rock containing elongate fragments of brown pumice as much as 10 inches long, which make up from less than 1 percent to as much as 20 percent' of the rock.
The welded tuff is distinctly layered because of alinement of lenticular pumice fragments, flakes of biotite, rectangular plagioclase crystals, and shards of glass. Phenocrysts of plagioclase, together with much less biotite, make up from 30 to 50 percent of the rock. Small cavities one-half to three-quarters of an inch long were noted in some places.
The plagioclase is seen to form subhedral to euhedral crystals from 0.13 to 2.75 mm in diameter. Some

RED VITRIC TUFF AND ASSOCIATED CONGLOMERATE AND SANDSTONE
Occurrence and relations.-Red vitric tuff intimately associated with red conglomerate and sandstone is exposed in scattered outcrops in the following areas in the southwestern· part of the Dugway Range (pl. 1): (1) on the :flats about 3Y2 miles northwest of Dugway Pass, (2) at the foot of the rhyolite flow along the southwest edge of the Dugway Range, and (3) in the valleys of the south-central p~rt of this range. The tuff is confined to the westernmost parts of these areas,. and grades eastward within a short distance into red conglomerate and sandstone.
Small ledges of the red vitric tuff crop out in the bottoms of washes and the cut banks of stream channels, and the rock forms low ridges partly covered . with alluvium between washes. Good outcrops are scarce, particularly on the low rounded spurs which extend westward from the volcanic foothills of the range. The conglomerate is more weathered, as a rule, than the tuff, but the presence of conglomerate is indicated by boulders and cobbles of sedimentary rock resting on a reddish-brown soil.
These rocks probably belong to the older volcanic group. In many places the red tuff appears to be intruded by a green spherulitic glass, and is overlain by highly fractured red rhyolite of the younger group. Many of the fractures in this rhyolite are filled with pebble dikes in which the pebbles consist of hard red material similar to the tuff. In most places the red sandstone and conglomerate probably rest directly upon sedimentary rocks of Paleozoic age, although no actual contacts were seen. The sandstone and conglomerate are overlain in some places by white to pink vitric tuffs at the base of the younger volcanic group, but in other places the tuffs are absent and

the sandstone and conglomerate are directly overlain by rhyolite of the younger group.
The steepest dip observed in this unit is 16°, but the average dip is about 5°. The strike is variable, probably because the material was laid down in most places on the eroded surface of the Paleozoic sedimentary rocks.
Lithology.-The vitric tuff has a distinctive brickred color, is well-indurated, and consists of scattered rock fragments in an ashy matrix. The tuff commonly has flaggy bedding and in places it has a conchoidal fracture. The rock fragments are mostly angular pieces of volcanic rock, but they copsist in small part of sedimentary rocks. Vesicles are common in the tuff, and in places make up as much as 30 percent of volume of the rock. Quartz-lined vugs are present locally.
Thin sections show that about 20 percent of the red tuff consists of small broken corroded crystals, chiefly quartz but including considerable sanidine and a very little biotite and magnetite. The crystals are generally less than 0.25 mm in diameter. The groundmass consists almost entirely of iron-stained shards of devitrified glass (fig. 26), but locally contains some interstitial calcite. The shards have undergone little or no compression.
By lateral gradation and interbedding, the tuff passes into dark-red, moderately to slightly indu-
FIGURE 26.-Photomlcrograph of r ed vltrlc tutr showing closely packed shards and r elict outlines of shards. X 18; plain trans· mitted Ught .

rated sandstone and into conglomerate that consists chiefly of rounded to subrounded fragments ranging in size from sand to boulders. The fragments are chiefly of limestone and dolomite, but include some cobbles of volcanic rocks. Much of the sand-size material consists of round frosted quartz grains. Crossbedding is common, and the conglomerate contains lenses of sand in most exposures. The conglomerate and sandstone contain a small proportion of pink to red clay, probably derived from ash. Red iron-staining is common in the pieces of sedimentary rock as well as in the matrix.
The presence of well-rounded clastic particles and the distinct bedding indicate that the sandstone and conglomerate were deposited by running water.
INTRUSIVE BRECCIA
Occurrence and relations.-The breccia now to be described is exposed mainly in the north-central and northeastern parts of Spor Mountain. It there forms bodies of widely differing size; many are only a few feet across, but one on the east side of Spor Mountain is 1,500 feet wide by 6,000 feet long. Outside the vicinity of Spor Mountain the breccia occurs in an area about a square mile in extent south of ·wildhorse Spring, and in a small area near the head of Shadscale Canyon, in the southern part of the Dugway Range.
The breccia is much weathered, and generally forms smooth slopes thickly covered with brick-red soil strewn with oriented blocks as much as 100 feet across derived from several older formations. Where small bodies of this breccia have been intruded into fault fissures, they are often rather hard to distinguish from rhyolite dikes, which weather to red soils near their contacts with carbonate rocks, and from rocks in fault zones altered by solutions moving along these fissures.
Most of the bodies of intrusive breccia cut Paleozoic sedimentary rocks, which are generally shattered near the contact. On Spor Mountain the breccia has been emplaced in rocks of Silurian and Ordovician age, and near the head of Shadscale Canyon in rocks of Cambrian age. Although the breccia is in contact with rocks of the younger volcanic group at several places along the east side of Spor Mountain, none of its contacts with these rocks are well exposed. The available evidence, however, suggests that the intrusive breccia belongs to the older volcanic group rather than to the younger. This correlation is supported by the fact that the intrusive breccia contains fragments of porphyritic rhyolite and rhyodacite of the older volcanic group but no fragments of the younger

86 GEOLOGY AND MINERAL DEPOSITS, THOMAS AND DUGWAY RANGES, UTAH

volcanic rocks; the younger volcanic group, more-

over, is not known to be cut by any body of intrusive

breccia.

Lithology.-Although the intrusive breccia varies

considerably in composition from place to place, it

consists for the most part of small to large pieces

of sedimentary and volcanic rocks in a matrix of sec-

ondary dolomite or· volcanic material. Many masses

of rock mapped as intrusive breccia consist of dolo-

mite blocks in a red matrix of secondary dolomite.

Some contain blocks of igneous rock mixed with

blocks of dolomite; some are composed almost en-

tirely of. igneous blocks in a red dolomitic matrix;

and a few of the smaller masses are made up of ig-

neous blocks in an igneous matrix, mainly glass.

Although most of the sedimentary blocks are dolo-

mite, a few of limestone and quartzite have been

noted. · In some places the smaller dolomite fragments

are completely or partly silicified. The igneous rock

in the intrusive breccia is mostly porphyritic rhyo-

lite, but in a few places it is partly rhyodacite. About

3,000 feet south-southeast of the Bell Hill mine, in

outcrops along both sides of a wash, small fragments

of rhyodacite are intermixed with blocks of dolomite

as much as 15 feet in diameter. Intrusive breccia

composed almost wholly of porphyritic rhyolite is

well exposed' in the cut leading into the main Lost

Sheep pipe and also near the mouth of the lower

adit at the Blowout pipe.

·

The rock fragments that make up part of this brec-

cia ranges from grains less. than 1 mm in diameter to

blocks as much as 100 feet in diameter. The larger

blocks are chiefly of dolomite; the pieces of igneous

rock rarely exceed 6 inches in diameter.

The breccia on Spor Mountain is believed to have

been formed by gaseous explosions, or "blowouts,"

that shattered volcanic and sedimentary rocks, frag-

ments qf which fell into the "blowout" craters and

were in some places cemented with lava. Walker

(1928, p. 942) in a proposed classification for explo-

sion pipes containing similar breccias, divided them

into four types: (1) those consisting only of ex-

ploded material, (2) those in which the interstitial

spaces between the breccia fragments are filled with

lava, (3) those in which the breccia is penetrated by

one or more dikes or small columns of lava, .and (4)

those in which the breccia is nearly or completely dis-

placed by lava. All four types are found on Spor

Mountain. Breccia· pipes of explosive origin have

been found in the Inner Hebrides, Scotland, by

Geikie (1897, p. 276-297) and in Missouri by Rust

(1937, p. 48-75).

YOUNGER VOLCANIC GROUP
GENERAL FEATURES
About 95 percent of the volcanic rocks in the Thomas and Dugway Ranges are assigned to the younger volcanic group. This group rests unconformably on the older volcanic group and is probably of · Pliocene age (Seep. 116). The younger volcanic group consists in the main of five subgroups. Each of the subgroups, where it is completely represented, is accordingly made up, in ascending order, of vitric tuff, volcanic breccia, and lava flows. These rocks exhibit considerable variety of color and texture, but are all rhyolitic in composition. The dominant rock in all the subgroups is gray rhyolite.
In addition to these products of cyclic eruption, the younger _v.olcanic.group includes.a material, .briefly designated as "green glass" because of its prevailing color and texture, that was formed by local remelting of the volcanic rocks. This material cuts across the flows and pyroclastic beds in some places but is concordant with them in others.

E Flow layering, due to subparallel orientation of phenocrysts, microlites, and crystallites caused in turn by differential movement within the lava, is generally conspicuous in the rhyolite flows; the layers exhibit abrupt variations of strike and dip and form numerous folds with amplitudes that do not exceed a few hundred feet-too small to be adequately represented on the scale of the mapping (pl. 1). Toward the tops of the flows, the layers commonly form even more contorted folds that may have an amplitude of only a few inches (fig. 29). The bases of the flows are some-

what irregular and undulating, but in general are fairly flat (pl. 4). In most places the flow layering is not parallel to the bases of the flows. Irregularities in the bases of the flows, as marked by the varying attitudes of basal obsidian layers, are believed to reflect the initial attitude of flows extruded on irregularly undulating surfaces, though it may include the effects of weak folding in continuance of the deformation that affected the older volcanic group. Small
domal protuberances on these flows, formed either by erosion between periods of eruption or by the piling up of volcanic rocks during the flow, are believed to be fairly common, and in the northeastern part of the Thomas Range (pl. 1) a valley that cuts through a flow exposes one of these structures on an underlying flow (pl. 4). In other areas, especially in the northern part of the Thomas Range, a group of small patches of obsidian surrounded by rhyolite may represent the tops of such domal structures. Such knobs have been noted on the Autunite No.8 property, where

porphyritic rhyolite of the older volcanic group was eroded before the deposition of white vitric tuff of the younger group (fig. 25). The white tuff laps up on these hills, and near their sides it has an initial dip of 15°. Higher up the tuff is almost horizontal. A section of another knob can be seen in the steep scarp east of the central part of The Dell, where the gray rhyolite of the younger volcanic group is overlain by a series of pyroclastic rocks and flows. These rocks are fairly thick along the sides of the knob but pinch out near its top. An obsidian band at the base of the overlying rhyolite is separated from the underlying rhyolite by tuff and volcanic breccia except at the top of the knob (fig. 30).
Because rhyolite is a viscous lava, it commonly has uneven tops. Hardening of the surface of a flow may cause irregular swelling and rising as more lava is added underneath the top. Irregularities of surfaces may also result from erosion between periods of eruption. About a mile northwest of Colored Pass, there is a cliff more than 200 feet high cut in the top of a rhyolite flow; the flow was subsequently buried under vitric tuff that has been partly removed (fig. 31). This cliff cuts across the flow lines of the obsidian and gray rhyolite and was almost certainly formed by erosion.
Tuffs commonly fill or partly fill the deeper depres-
sions in the underlying flows, but where a flow of rhyolite reaches a depression that is not filled with
tuff, the obsidian layer at the base of the flow bends over the underlying irregularities and may acquire

n. steep dip; abrupt steepening in the dips of obsidian layers is quite common. Dips of more than 45° are rare, but in a small gully on the south side of Searles Canyon, near its upper end, an obsidian layer is exposed that is almost vertical. Most of these changes in dip, however, are only local; the obsidian layer as a whole is flat lying.
Each of the flows was poured out on a broad undulating surface that resembles a mature land surface

Lithology.-The vitric tuff is generally a friable white rock containing volcanic fragments, chiefly of pumice in a matrix of ash and small crystal fragments. Most of the tuff is white, but much of it is of some pastel shade such as greenish white, btn, yel1owish gray, yellowish green, greenish tan, or grayish orange pink. The rocks mapped as vitric tuff have a wide range in grain size. A few layers consist almost wholly of ash with no visible rock fragments. Most of the layers, however, contain numerous frag-
ments ranging from lft6 to 1 inch in diameter, and
some layers from 4 inches to 2 feet in thickness consist of volcanic breccia containing a few fragments as much as a foot in diameter. The breccia generally grades into tuff. These layers of breccia, which are too thin to map separately, differ from the thicker layers of breccia described below in containing smaller and rounder fragments and in having a more ashy matrix. The proportion of coarse to fine material in tuff varies widely; rock fragments make up as little as 10 percent of the rock in some places and as much as 50 percent elsewhere. More than 95 percent of the rock fragments consists of volcanic materials, the most abundant of which is white pumice. The abundance of this material serves as a convenient distinction from the tuffs of the older volcanic group. Other rocks common among the fragments are gray or reddish gray glass, devitrified glass, porphyritic rhyolite, and tuff. Much less common are fragments of rhyodacite, quartzite, limestone, and dolomite. Obsidian fragments occur only sparsely in most of the tuff, but they increase in abundance toward the top of each tuff layer, and just below the glassy base of the overlying lava they may be more abundant than the fragments of other rocks.
Pore spaces and small cavities, generally elliptical in shape, are common in the. vitric tuff, and may make up as much as 30 percent of the volume of the rock. S~me of the cavities are 6 mm across, but most are much smaller and many are less than 1 mm across.
Crystal fragments are rarely visible in hand specimens. of the v:itric tuff, but in thin s'ections they are seen to make up from 3 to 25 percent of the rock or,
on the average, about 10 percent. Most of the crys-
tals are of quartz and sanidine, quartz being the more
common in some places and sanidine in others. Quartz
makes up less than 1 to 15 percent of the rock, and
sanidine 3 to 20 percent. These minerals form an-
hedral to euhedral crystals and also many fragments,
from 0.05 mm to 2 mm in diameter. Plagioclase in small anl~edral to subhedral crystals, some zoned, is
present in many places but rarely exceeds 3 percent
of the rock. The overall composition of the crystals
712-190 0-64-7

ranges from An25 to An40• Biotite and magnetite are commonly present, but each generally makes up less than 1 percent of the rock. Biotite occurs in small, partly altered prismatic grains and magnetite in small rounded grains. In several specimens a few crystals of zircon were noted, and small amounts of hornblende, topaz, and microcline were found, but each in only one specimen.
The matrix of the tuff is a fine-grained ash, which in thin section is seen to consist of fragments of clear light- or medium-brown glass, in part devitrified, with many irregular cavities. In some specimens. much of the glass is in shards, but in others no shards were found. Some of the cavities in certain specimens are lined with minute crystals of tridymite and cristohalite. A few specimens contain opal and chalcedony. The glass contains few crystallites.
The vitric tuff of the younger volcanic group can be easily distinguished from the crystal tuffs of the older volcanic group by the following characteristics: (1) This vitric tuff consists chiefly of fragments of glass, whereas the crystal tuffs in the older group consist chiefly of pieces of crystals; (2) the crystal fragments in' this vitric tuff are small and generally not visible except under the microscope, whereas those in the older crystal tuffs are large and easily visible in hand specimens; (3) welding in the vitric tuffs is restricted to thin layers no more than a few feet thick and of small extent, whereas in the older crystal tuffs it affected thick beds over wide areas; and (4) pore spaces and cavities are numerous throughout the vitric tuffs, whereas they are either scarce or absent in the older crystal tuffs. Vitric tuffs within the older and· younger volcanic groups aTe much alike in lithologic character and can best be distinguished by their rela-
tions to other volcanic rocks. Chemical composition.-A. chemical analysis (table
15, no. 7) of a specimen of white vitric tuff collected 0.6 mile northeast of the portal of the Bell Hill tun:·- · nel indicated a rhyolitic composition according to the classification of Rittmann (1952, p. 95) . The norm of this rock differs from those of the rhyolite and green glass in the younger volcanic group in containing somewhat less orthoclase and albite and more anorthite, corundum, and hypersthene. The vitric tuff consists of rhyolitic material with some small pieces of rhyodacite and carbonate rocks. Of the other samples from the younger volcanic group, the one that is nearest in chemical composition to this rock is a sample of green glass from Colored Pass (table 15, no. 14) . This latter rock is a · mixture of volcanic material from at least two periods of eruption.

92 GEOLOGY AND MINERAL DEPOSITS, THOMAS AND DUGWAY RANGES, UTAH

Fossils.-The vitric tuff is the only volcanic rock in the Thomas and Dugway Ranges that is known to contain any fossil remains. Petrified wood was found at two localities. One of these is a broad northwesttrending band of tuff, a mile and a half long, the center of which is about a mile northeast of Colored Pass. The other locality is at the south end of the Thomas Range, where several logs were found on the eroded surface of the Garden City formation, half a .mile from the nearest exposures of the tuff. These logs, however, were presumably once enclosed in tuff that has been removed by erosion.
The petrified wood consists of branches or logs from less than an inch to 3 feet in diameter and as much as 8 feet in length. The wood, together with some remnants of its bark, has been completely replaced by brown, gray, or black siliceous material. Several specimens ·of this wood were submitted for identification to R. C. Scott of the U.S. Geological Survey, who reported, "The wood is recognizable as gymnospermous wood, ·hut due to poor preservation no further determination can be made. The wood has lost most of its original organic structure and has undergone ·extensive compression and distortion." Inasmuch as gymnosperms have persisted from Devonian. to Recent time, this material gives no help in determining the age of the tuff.

VOLCANIC BRECCIA

Ocaurrenee and relations.-The volcanic breccia of

the younger volcanic group occurs mainly in the west-

ern part of the Thomas Range and the southern part of th~ Dugway Range. Although it has a wide extent·

in a north-south direction, there if little of it in the

eastern part of the Thomas Range except on Antelope

Ridge. The breccia is known to ·l;le present at the

bases of all the subgroups except the first, whose ba8e

is not exposed, and it is especially abundant below the

upper two rhyolite flows.

·

As was pointed out in describing the general fea-

tures of the younger volcanic group, the iavas of that

group were erupted mainly from five centers roughly

on a north-south line extending through the middle

of the volcanic tract in the Dugway and Thomas

Ranges. The northernmost volcanic center, on Pyra-

mid Peak in the Dugway Range, may have given rise

to explosive eruptions as well as lava flows, for it is

surrounded by one of the thickest masses of breccia.

Other masses of breccia lie either near the western

margin of the zone containing the four main eruptive

centers in the Thomas Range or still farther to the

west. One possible explanation for this, if it is as-

sumed that the breccia came from the same centers as

the flows, is that the explosions were powerful and blew out to the west. Another, which appears more likely, is that the sources of the breccia lay considerably to the west of most of the sources of flows, which may also have erupted much of the vitric tuff. Powers (1932, p. 281-282) and Anderson (1941, p. 367-382) have shown that in the Modoc Lava Bed quadrangle, California, explosive eruptions and lava flows came from separate sources.
This volcanic breccia is rather friable, and where not exposed on steep slopes· it is covered either with talus from the overlying rhyolite or with fragments of rhyolite and obsidian that have weathered out of the breccia itself. There are many excellent exposures of the breccia, however, on steep slopes protected by thick overlying flows of resistant rhyolite.
The volcanic breccia is most commonly underlain by vitric tuff and overlain by ob,sidian. In a number of places, however, the pyroclastic layer consists wholly of breccia, as it does for example, below the uppermost two flows on Antelope Ridge, in certain places near the northeast end of The Dell, and around Pyramid Peak. In a reversal of the general order of deposition, volcanic breccia underlies vitric tuff in a small area in the southern part of Dugway Range. Whether breccia or tuff is deposited first probably depends mainly on whether the eruption began with a violent explosion or began quietly and then increased in violence.
Not only is the breccia confined to certain areas, but its present distribution within these areas is erratic. Part of its erratic distribution is due to it being deposited locally, and part is due to it being removed by later erosion. Along the east side of Pyramid Peak the breccia is scarce or absent, but on the west side several hundred feet of breccia is exposed, its thickness there being near the maximum fig. 27). In
other areas, the breccia may pinch out completely against the flank of a buried hill. Vitric tuff and breccia are found along the sides, brit not on the top, of ·a buried rhyolite hill on the eastern side of The
Dell (fig. 30). Lithology.-The volcanic breccia consists of poorly
sorted angular fragments in a matrix of ash. It varies widely in color, through black, gray, white, greenish white, grayish pink, tan, reddish brown, and orange. The color changes both from one layer to the next and laterally within individual layers.
Fragments make up from about 25 to 85 percent o·f the breccia and are most abundant in the coarser layers. They have a wide range in size. In some layers of breccia they are little larger than those in

the tuffs (less than 11,4 inches in diameter), but in other layers there are fragments as much as 3 feet in diameter. The fragments in the breccia consist almost entirely of volcanic material, and most are glassy (fig. 32). They are commonly obsidian, gray glass, pumice, gray rhyolite, reddish gray rhyolite, and brown porphyritic rhyolite. Pieces of limestone, dolomite, and quartzite are rare and generally less than an inch in diameter. Some of the fragments, especially the smaller ones, are subangular; most, however, are angular blocks of material believed to have been consolidated before the explosions that formed the breccia. No bombs have been found, nor any other evidence that the blocks forming the breccia were in a molten condition when flying through the air. For this reason the rock was called a volcanic breccia rather than an agglomerate, in accord-
ance with the usage of vVentworth and Williams
(1932, p. 45-46, 51). The matrix of the breccia is a compact ash. The
mineral grains in it are mostly too small to be visible in hand specimens, but in thin sections they are

seen to make up as much as 35 percent of the matrix. They are chiefly anhedral to subhedral crystals of sanidine and quartz. Subhedral plagioclase (oligoclase to andesine) is probably next in quantity. All specimens contain small amounts of anhedral biotite and magnetite. Apatite, sphene, hornblende, and pyroxene were noted in individual specimens. Shards of glass are numerous m some specimens and absent in others. In some places there are many small cavities, some of which contain minute crystals of tridymite or cristobalite, or both. In a few places fractures in the breccia are filled with clay minerals and calcite.
One of the commonest types of breccia consists almost entirely of large jumbled blocks of obsidian. In some places, for example, in an outcrop half a mile east of the Bell Hill mine (pl. 1), the matrix is ashy, but in other places it contains varying amounts of black glass. At the bases of some rhyolite flows, obsidian explosion breccia grades into obsidian flow breccia. (Seep. 95.) ·
RHYOLITE
Occu'N'ence, relations, and facies.-Rhyolite is found throughout the eastern part of the Thomas Range, and makes up at least 95 percent of the younger volcanic group. Outside the area mapped, it occurs in the Drum Mountains to the south and makes up a large part of the Keg Mountains to the east. Similar rhyolite is also found in the Honeycomb Hills, which lie about 3 miles west of the Fish Springs Range.
The rhyolite is highly resistant to erosion, and along the east side of The Dell and around Topaz Mountain it forms cliffs as much as 800 feet high (fig. 18B). There is little soil on this rock, and much of it is almost devoid of vegetation.
Rhyolite forms the main part of each of the five major subgroups in the younger volcanic group. A layer of rhyolite usually rests conformably on either vitric tuff or volcanic breccia. It is usually at the top of an eruptive sequence, but in some places the uppermost part of the sequence consists of vitric tuff or breccia. The surface of the rhyolite beneath these pyroclastic rocks is almost unmodified in some places, but in other places it is more or less eroded. Rhyolite of the younger volcanic group is not often found in contact with either the older volcanic rocks or the Paleozoic rocks, but in several places it overlies porphyritic rhyolite of the older group, and along the northeast side of the main volcanic area in the Dugway Range it rests on the upturned edges of the
Paleozoic rocks.

94 GEOLOGY AND MINERAL DEPOSITS, THOMAS AND DUGWAY RANGES, UTAH

Lithology.-The rhyolite varies from place to place in color, texture, abundance of phenocrysts, degree of layering, and presence or absence of spherulites. The variations are gradational, and there may be as many differences between parts of a single flow as between two separate flows; it is rarely possible to determine, by inspection or even by microscopic study, what flow a given specimen of rhyolite came from. Two rhyolite flows in the northwestern part of the Thomas Range, however, can be distinguished in places by the presence of copper-colored biotite flakes in the older flow.
The rhyolite is divisible into three facies: obsidian, red spherulitic rhyolite, and gr-ay rhyolite. A thin layer of obsidian, formed by rapid cooling, is generally formed at the base of a thick flow of rhyolite (fig. 28). Obsidian has also been found within or beneath layers of volcanic breccia in the northwestern part of the Thomas Range and about a mile northwest of the north end of Antelope Ridge. Discontinuous layers of obsidian occur, also, within other bodies of rhyolitic lava south of Dugway Pass, where they probably mark chilled surfaces of flows. The red spherulitic rhyolite is almost always found just above the obsidian near the base of a flow, but in a few places, notably in the northeastern part of the Thomas Range, it occurs considerably above the base. Whether in these places the red layers mark pauses in the outpouring of the lava is not known. Red spherulitic rhyolite resting on obsidian forms extremely irregular layers, which may vary laterally in thickness from less than an inch to 200 feet within a distance of 600 or 700 feet. The spherulitic rhyolite was found in all the subgroups except the lowest, in which only the top of the flow is exposed. The red rhyolite usually grades into gray rhyolite, through rock consisting of red spherulites in a gray matrix, but in ·some places the contact between the two facies is fairly sharp. The gray rhyolite makes up about 95 percent of all the rhyolite in the younger volcanic group.
Because the obsidian facies has sharp boundaries and is useful in distinguishing main subgroups from one another where pyroclastics are absent, it was mapped separately, but the gray and red rhyolites are represented by a single color symbol.
Associated with these three facies of rhyolite is a minor quantity of rhyolitic flow breccia. This is mostly in discontinuous zones near the bases of the flows, just above the obsidian, but in a few places it is at the tops of flows. Most of the flow breccia is in bodies no more than a few hundred feet long that grade laterally into massive rhyolite; these layers are as much as 200 feet thick in some places, but

for the most part they are much thinner. Because of its similarity to the rhyolite, the small size of its individual exposures, and its erratic and gradational contacts, the flow breccia is mapped with the rhyolite.
Obsld1an ractes
Lithology.-The obsidian in most places consists mainly of a black spherulitic glass with a conchoidal fracture, but this rock varies considerably in texture and color within short distances. In some places it has a distinct slabby parting (fig. 33). Some of it is dark gray, and it contains brown, reddish-brown, and light-gray layers and lenses. Lenses, streaks, or matrix of brown glass around black glass spherulites are common. The spherulites noted in the obsidian are of two types. The most common are black and brown glassy spherulites, 1 to 2 mm in diameter, which make up much of the obsidian. Less common are brown aphanitic to porphyritic spherulites from about 1,4 to 6 inches in diameter; these commonly occur in irregular pockets of brown aphanitic rock similar in composition to the spherulites, mostly in the upper 10 feet of an obsidian layer.
Most of the spherulites are incompletely formed; their bases merging with the surrounding rock. Those that are completely formed superficially resemble the concretions in sedimentary rocks. The spherulites are generally solid, but a few are hollow, and some former cavities are filled with chalcedony and opal. At one place a little fluorite was noted in a cavity. In some places, at the south end of the Thomas Range for example, obsidian layers enclose small irregular lenses of red spherulitic rhyolite.
FIGURE 33.-Slabby structure In obsidian layer, north-central Thomas Range.

GENERAL GEOLOGY

95

Some of the obsidian is porphyritic, but phenocrysts rarely make up more than 4 to 5 percent of the rock. The most common phenocrysts are clear to white rectangular crystals of sanidine; quartz is less abundant and plagioclase even less so. In the two specimens in which the maximum extinction angle was measured, the plagioclase was andesine. Trace quantities of biotite and magnetite are found in a few places.
As seen· in thin section, the glass in the obsidian is generally clear and light to medium brown and commonly cont!llins perlitic cracks. In most places it has a well-developed flow structure brought out by differences in the color and texture of the glass and by smrull oriented microlites and crystalli.,tes. In some areas crystallites are abundant; most are trichytes, but in some places they include belonites and globulites. Cavities in the glass are scarce; a few are lined with small crystals of tridymite.
In a few places the obsidian grades into a flow breccia that is of two types, one consisting of angular blocks of black obsidian in a black glass matrix and the other of lenticular black obsidian blebs in a brown glass matrix. The first type is fairly common in some areas, such as the southeastern part of the Thomas Range. Some obsidian layers grade downward into thin layers of flow breccia consisting of blocks of obsidian in an obsidian matrix, and in a few places, one of them 0.8 mile east of the mout~ of Topaz Valley, an obsidian layer grades lateral1y mto a flow breccia. Most of the flow breccia is confined to the basal parts of the obsidian layer and was probably formed by the breaking up of an original chilled crust by continued movement of lava in the overlying flow.
In a few areas, especially west of the Autunite No. 8 prospect, the glass layer consists of numerous elongate fragments of dark-gray or black obsidian in a brown glass matrix; this material closely resembles welded tuff (fig. 34) . The matrix of this rock, however has a conspicuous flow structure and contains unb;okep spherulites and no shards. Along strike this rock grades into normal obsidian. How the elongate fragments were formed is not known. Perhaps they were originally part of a thin crust which was broken ·up and carried along in the moving flow, or perhaps they represent blobs of viscous glass that were thrown upward by explosion, fe1l back into the still molten glass, and were stretched by flowage.
Chemical composition.-A chemical analysis was made of black obsidian col1ected on the west side of the Thomas Range, 1.8 miles north of Wildhorse Spring (table 15, no. 8). This rock was very similar in composition to analyzed specimens of other facies

FIGURE 34. -Specimen from the base of an obsidian layer showing lenticular black obsid1a.n fragments in a brown glass matrix from west of the Autunite No. 8 claim. White bar is 1 inch long.

of the rhyolite, especially to the red spherulitic rhyo-

lite (table 15, no. 9) that commonly overlies the

obsidian layer from which the sample came, and to a

gray rhyolite from the uppermost flow (table 15,

no. 11). The greatest difference in composition be-

tween the obsidian and the rhyolites is that the ob-

sidian contains about 4 times as much HzO as any of

the rhyolites. This is not surprising because glass is

known for its high water content. A compilation of

analyses published in U.S.G.S. Professional Paper 99

(Washington, 1917, p. 56-233) shows that 35 samples

of obsidians, presumably rhyolitic, averaged 1.44 per-

cent water. · The norm of the obsidian (tahle 15,

no. 8) is almost identical with the norm of the gray

rhyolite No. 10. Both rocks would be classified by

Rittmann (1952, p. 95) as alkali-rhyolite.

The values in the table indicate that there is not much difference in composition between the spherulitic and the nonspherulitic obsidian, and the specimens all contain about the same proportion of H20. They thus suggest that the various layers of obsidian do not differ more widely in composition than the various overlying rhyolites.

Red spherulltlc facies

Lithology.-The red spherulitic facies of the rhyo-

lite is made up of numerous small spherulites set in

an aphanitic or glassy groundmass (fig. 35). Its

color is mostly hematitic red but varies to gray, pur-

plish gray, pale red, and reddish brown. Most of

the spherulites are easily visible in hand specimen,

although in a few places none were noted except un-

der the microscope.
The spherulites range from less than Y2 mm to

about 10 mm in diameter. The larger ones, which

generally have hollow centers, are found only in cer-

tain small areas, one of which is near the south end of

Antelope Ridge and another on the south side of a

small ridg pr~spect.

e

11/2 miles Abundant

northwest of the Autunite No. 8 spherulites commonly occur in

layers separated by layers that contain relatively few.

The spherulites consist mainly of radiating fibers of

potassium feldspar and quartz, together with some

glass. The radiating fibers may show a black extinc-

tion cross .vhen viewed between crossed nicols. The

fibers do not generally form complete spherulites;

they are commonly in sheaves or bundles that, in cross

section, fill only a half or a third of a circle. Spheru-

lites appear to have formed late during the crystalli-

zation, for they commonly surround or partly sur-

round phenocrysts. They are also common in the

matrix, where they are superimposed in some places

upon a preexisting flow structure (fig. 38). Flow

structure is common· in the red spherulitic rhyolite.

The individual laminae have an average thickness of about 0.25 mm. The flow lines bend around the phenocrysts, and in some places, particularly just above the obsidian layer, they are highly contorted.
Most of the red spherulitic rhyolite contains few phenocrysts that are visible in hand specimens, and even in some thin sections there are none. In some specimens, however, they make up as much as 30 percent of the rock. On the average they make up about 10 percent of the rock-slightly less than in the gray f acies. They are euhedral to subhedral crystals that range in length from 0.10 to 3.25 mm. They consist mainly of sanidine and quartz; these minerals vary widely in relative abundance, but sanidine generally predominates. Plagioclase, when present, is third in abundance and may constitute as much as 3 percent of the rock. It occurs in small subhedral to euhedral crystals wl{ose average composition ranges from An1s to An35·
The chief dark minerals are biotite and magnetite, but the amount of each nowhere exceeds 1 percent. A very little hornblende is present in some specimens, and a few minute grains of zircon were identified.

The groundmass of most specimens is made up of (1) spherulites enclosed in a matrix that consists of glass containing some microlites and crystallites and (2) mosaics of · interlocking crystals with low birefringence. The crystal mosaics generally form eyeshaped pockets that in places form as much as 20 percent of the rock interlayered with spherulitic rock. The mosaics consist chiefly of quartz and sanidine, but most of them also contain tridymite, cristobalite, or both. Other minerals noted in the groundmass include topaz in a specimen from the southern tip of Antelope Ridge and fluorite in a specimen from a small hill just north of Spor Mountain.
Chemical C011Vp08ition.-A chemical analysis was made of a specimen of red spherulitic rhyolite from the east side of the Thomas Range, 2.5 miles southsoutheast of Dugway Pass (table 15, no. 9). This analysis reveals no significant differences in composition between the red rhyolite and the analyzed specimens of the gray rhyolite (table 15, nos. 10-13).
Gray facies
Lithology.-The gray facies of the rhyolite is generally a dense aphanitic rock containing some spherulites and a few visible phenocrysts of quartz and sanidine in a glassy matrix. Its color in most places is light gray, but in some places it is pinkish gray, medium yellowish brown, and light brownish gray. The exposed surfaces of this rhyolite have a characteristic honeycomb appearance, which is due to the weathering out of pockets along certain layers, especially those that contain lithophysae (fig. 36) . In some areas this rhyolite is broken into crude steps whose risers are vertical joints.
Flow layers are common in some places in the gray rhyolite, although not everywhere; they are commonly folded into anticlines or synclines. Some of these folds are several hundred feet across, but they tend to become smaller and more contorted near the tops or bottoms of flows.
The tops of these rhyolite flows commonly consist of olive-green to br:own glass containing numerous small cavities elongated parallel to the flow structure. In some places normal gray aphanitic rhyolite may be
traced upward through partly glassy rock to nearly all glass at the top of the flow (fig. 29).
Some of the gray rhyolite contains no spherulites, but about half of it contains at least a few; on the whole, spherulites are not nearly as common in this rock as in the red facies. The spherulites are mostly too small to be readily seen in hand specimens. Litho-
physae, from about 'lti to 8 inches in diameter, are
locally abundant, particularly in Topaz Valley. The

Lineation of holes results from orientation of lithophysae parallel to fiow lines. Field of view Is about 15 feet across.
lithophysae are spherical and consist of a series of thin concentric shells of rhyolite separated by hollow spaces. The shells are mostly incomplete and tend to coalesce at one end. Some of the lithophysae have hollow centers. Small crystals of topaz, quartz, or sanidine commonly protrude into the hollow spaces at the center and between the shells. Some authors (Tyrrell, 1948,, p . 98; Grout, 1932, p. 41) consider lithophysae to be large spherulites, but this view is open to question because spherulites are generally made up of radiating fibers and lithophysae of concentric shells:
Locally, and especially in Topaz Valley, the rhyolite contains small cavities or vugs as much as 11/z

inches in diameter, which contain well-developed crystals of topaz, specularite, quartz, pink beryl, bixbyite, garnet, and pseudobrookite that have aroused the interest of mineralogists and mineral collectors (p. 102 to 108).
In most places the gray facies contains only a few small phenocrysts that are visible in the hand specimen. In a few places, however, as in an area at the north end of the Thomas Range, 1 to 2 miles west of Dugway Pass, and in another area on the east side of the Thomas Range, 11/2 miles northeast of Colored Pass, phenocrysts are about as abundant in this rock as in the porphyritic rhyolite of the older volcanic group. In thin sections the phenocrysts, mostly of microscopic size, are seen to make up as much as 35 percent of the rock in some places but to be almost absent in others; the average is about 14 percent. The phenocrysts are chiefly of sanidine and quartz. Sanidine occurs in subhedral to euhedral crystals from 0.05 to 3.5 mm in diameter, and quartz (which is somewhat less abundant) in anhedral to subhedral crystals from 0.10 to 3.5 mm in diameter. Plagioclase is much less abundant than quartz and is not everywhere present, but in places it makes up as much as 3 percent of the rock. It occurs in subhedral to euhedral crystals, which range from 0.15 mm to 2.5 mm in , length. Because of its scarcity, a maximum extinction angle measurement was difficult to obtain in many specimens, but the extinction angles measured indicate that it ranges from about An20 to An53• Biotite and magnetite are the principal dark minerals, but neither is present in all thin sections, and neither forms more than 1 percent of any section. Biotite occurs in small euhedral crystals, which in some places are partly altered; its usual color is copper brown. Magnetite occurs in small rounded grains.
In addition to the above minerals, from a trace to less than 1 percent of the following minerals have been noted in from one to six specimens : zircon, hematite, hornblende, sphene, augite, garnet, topaz, and dark-purple fluorite. Of these minerals, topaz and fluorite have a special interest because of their apparent lack of relation to the total fluorine content of the rhyolite. Topaz was noted in only 3 of the 76 thin sections of this rock, in which it forms small anhedral grains or rosettes in the groundmass. A chemical analysis of one of the specimens thus found to contain topaz (table 15, no. lO) shows a fluorine content of 0.14 percent. If the fluorine were all in topaz, the topaz content of this rock would be roughly 0.9 percent, considerably more than the few small grains found would indicate. Some of this excess fluorine could be in fluorite, but fluorite was found

in only one specimen from the north end of Spor Mountain, where it was very scarce (fig. 37). In thin sections from other analyzed specimens of this rhyolite, in all of ·which there was considerable fluorine, neither topaz nor fluorite was found.
The glass which generally makes up most of the groundmass appears colorless to light or medium brown in thin section. Some of it contains microlites and crystallites, and perlitic cracks have been noted in specimens from the northeastern part of the Thomas Range. In some thin sections most of the groundmass consists of devitrified glass containing only very minute crystals; in others it is a mosaic of interlocking larger crystals, chiefly of quartz and feldspar, with minor amounts of biotite, magnetite, tridymite, and cristobalite.
There are also small pockets or eyes of clear material, made up chiefly of quartz and sanidine crystals, commonly associated with tridymite or, locally, with cristobalite. The tridymite is mostly in small rectangular crystals, but in a few places it forms wedgeshaped twins or is anhedral. Most of the cristobalite shows no crystal form, although in places it forms small rosettes. Where both of these minerals are anhedral they are almost indistinguishable.

of the pyroclastic beds if they were present, or it may be found much lower in the underlying rhyolite. In places the green glass grades along strike into tutt Its contacts generally cut the overlying and underlying volcanic rocks at a small angle. In some places the boundaries of the green glass are so sharp that they can be located within a few inches. In many places, on the other hand, green glass and some other rock are separated by a gradational zone several hundred feet wide. Gradation of white vitric tuff into green glass passes through the following stages : first, parts of the tuff .take on a slightly greenish cast; then the greenish cast deepens and spreads all through the rock, whose texture becomes more uniform and less distinctly pyroclastic; and finally the rock is a pale-green glass with a spheroidal texture. The alteration of tuff appears to be partly a result of impregnation with silica. Similar changes take place in volcanic breccia. In rhyolitic lava, however, the changes are different. Gray aphanitic rhyolite changes first either to a gray porphyritic rhyolite or almost abruptly to a brown porphyritic rock with a groundmass containing varying amounts of dull-brown glass, which changes in turn to a porphyritic spherulitic rock and then to a green spherulitic glass. The transitions from one of these rocks to the next are generally abrupt and in some places there is much interlayering of the various rocks.
Because green glass cuts most of the rocks with which it is in contact, it might be regarded as the youngest rock in the younger volcanic group. Its relations to the other rocks appears, however, to be somewhat anomalous, inasmuch as it cuts sharply across other kinds of volcanic rock in some places and grades into them in others. Some of its characteristics appear to indicate that it was formed by replacement. The writers believe that the green glass may have formed, as suggested by T. A. Steven of the U.S. Geological Survey, in and near the vents and that it consists not only of the vent fillings but also of partially remelted adjacent wall rocks, with the possible addition of some. new material. The generally steep dips of flow layers in the green glass, suggesting that its parent magma moved steeply upward, would be explained by this theory of origin. Some of the larger green glass bodies, moreover, such as those on Pyramid Peak and in the north-central part of the Thomas Range, occur in areas that probably contained vents.
The green glass is rarely seen in contact with the volcanic rocks of the older group or with the underlying Paleozoic sedimentary rocks, but at several places in the southern part of the Dugway Range,

along the east flank of the volcanic rocks, it overlies upturned Cambrian rocks.
Lithology.-The material mapped as green glass includes not only the typical green spheroidal glass but also such gradational rocks as the brown porphyritic rock and the brown, gray, and greenish-gray spheroidal rocks, but no rocks in which a pyroclastic texture is visible. In short, it includes not only typical spheroidal green glass but all transitional material whose derivation is uncertain, and this transitional material covers a larger· total area than the glass.
The material here called green glass is mostly dark greenish gray, but in some places it is grayish green, light gray, brownish gray, brown, or reddish brown. The greenish-gray rock appears, megascopically, to consist almost wholly of clear glass broken by numerous perlitic fractures (fig. 3<8). It is these fractures, rather than the presence of spherulites, th?-t gives the rock is spheroidal texture. In some places, however, the rock contains many spherulites. Spherulites are in fact about as numerous, volume for volume, in the green glass unit as a whole as they are in any of the other volcanic rocks. The spherulites range in size from tiny pellets visible only under the microscope to large nodules 6 inches in diameter. In hand specimens they commonly appear to consist of light-brown or purplish-gray partly devit-

rified glass, and are darker colored than the glass that surrounds them. · In some thin sections the glass in the spherulites is light brown and is surrounded by clear glass (fig. 38), in others it is medium brown and is surrounded by a light-brown glass. Under the microscope the spherulites are seen to consist of radiating fibers that mostly have a lower refractive index than balsam; they are presumed to be mainly potassium feldspar, although some quartz is present. Spherulites or parts of spherulites commonly form on or around earlier formed phenocrysts. The larger ones (over half an inch in diameter) commonly have hollow centers. These cavities may be lined with quartz crystals, minute calcite crystals, or botryoidal masses of opal and chalcedony (fig. 39). Agate, the banded form of chalcedony, is rare, although it is found in a few localities. It is most common on the flats about 1 mile north of the northern end of the Thomas Range. Collectors have dug a number of pits in this area (see prospect symbols on plate 1),· and a brief article on collecting has been written by I ves (1946b, p. 411-415).
In some parts of the glass, conspicuous flow structures are brought out by the alinement of microlites or crystallites or by color-layering in the glass (fig. -1:0). The color layers range from microscopic size to several feet in width. Some bands may be entirely spherulitic material, and in others spherulites are absent.
Small open pockets or cavities, as much as 4 inches across, are plentiful and commonly contain rectangular crystals of tridymite or, in a few places, wedgeshaped twins. Cristobalite is also found in some of the cavities.
Few phenocrysts are visible in hand specimens, but in thin sections (fig. 40) it can be seen that small phenocrysts of quartz and sanidine commonly make up from 10 to 25 percent of the rock. Some of this

rock contains larger and more conspicuous phenvcrysts than the typical green glass, though the phenocrysts are of the same kinds and about equal in average abundance in the two kinds of rock. Quartz in subhedral to euhedral crystals, from 0.08 to 1.5 mm across, is very scarce in some specimens but makes up as much as 20 percent of others. Sanidine in subhedral to euhedral crystals, from 0.2 to 2.25 mm long, has about the same range in abundance. The embayment of both quartz and sanidine crystals in places by glass shows that they were formed before the glass solidified. Plagioclase phenocrysts form at most about 3 percent of the rock. They are generally smaller than those of quartz or sanidine, and some are enclosed in sanidine. Their composition ranges from An20 to An33 and averages about An26• Small more or less ragged crystals of biotite occur in almost every specimen, but nowhere make up more than 1 percent of the rock. Magnetite, in small rounded anhedra, generally occurs only in minute quantity. Some thin sections contain a very few small euhedral crystals of sphene and zircon.

and higher in albite than the norms of most of the rhyolitic rocks in the older group. The biggest difference in composition between this rock and the other rocks of rhyolitic composition is in the water content. In chemical analyses the water content. is divided into H 20- and H 20+ with H 20- .representing the water driven off by heating the rock to about 105°. HzOwould ordinarily represent water held in pore spaces, but some of the H 20- in this glass, which has the second highest H 20- content of all the analyzed rocks in this district and little pore space, may represent water dissolved in the glass itself. The HzO+ con.tent of the green glass (4.05 percent) is the highest found in any rock of this district and is at least six times as great as that found in any of the rhyolites except the obsidian (2.34 percent) (table 15, no. 8).
The specific gravity and index of refraction of two selected specimens of clean dark greenish-gray spheroidal glass of similar appearance, in which some crystallites were visible, were determined, with the
results shown in table 10.

The Thomas Range is a well-known collecting locality for a number of minera:ls which occur in cavities in the gray facies of the rhyolite (fig. 41) and for silica minerals found in several volcanic rocks. Topaz, red beryl, and bixbyite are the minerals of chief intetest in the cavities, and quartz, specularite, pseudobrookite, and garnet are of secondary interest. Although rhyolite flows extend well into the Dugway Range, these minerals are very rare in that area. These minerals first attracted scientific interest to the Thomas Range and have been described by Alling (1887), Buranek (1947), Cross (1886), Hillebrand (1905), Jones (1895), Montgomery (1934; 1935), Pabst (1938), Palache (1934) , Patton (1908), and Penfield and Foote (1897). In the rocks of the younger volcanic group, the silica minerals opal, chalcedony, and the banded variety called agate are commonly found. Not only have the silica minerals, as well as the minerals in cavities in the rhyolite, been of scientific inter·est but they are. in demand as collector's items. These minerals are discussed sepa-

Both clear and opaque crystals are found in the Thomas Range. The clear variety occurs singly or in clusters in small cavities, some of which are found in the hollow centers of lithophysae. These crystals are generally attached at one end, the other end being well terminated. Doubly terminated crystals attached in· the middle were found in a few places. Crystal faces are well developed, and Alling (1887, p. 146147) measured and described two pinacoids, b (010), c(001); two prisms, m(llO), 1(120); a macrodome, d (201) ; two brachydomes, f (021), y (041) ; and four pyramids, i(223), u(111), o(221), e(441), on topaz from the Thomas Range.
Many clear crystals, when broken out of the rhyolite, are pale amber, but on exposure to sunlight fade and become colorless. A few rose and amber topaz crystals, which had not faded, were found at the north end and on the east side of the Thomas Range. Similar rose topaz is reported (Montgomery, 1934, p. 87) from the east side of the Thomas Range just north of Pismire Wash. The topaz crystals vary in size but most of them are half an inch or less in length (along c axis) . The largest clear crystal known measured

2 inches in length and five-eighths of an inch across its greatest width; it was collected from near the center of Topaz Valley (Buranek, 1947, p. 38).
The opaque topaz is light gray to nearly black. Some of the crystals are in solid rhyolite, others are partly in cavities. The crystals appear to have grown in the rhyolite and to have incorporated parts of the rhyolite as they grew. Patton (1908, p. 185) investigated these crystals in thin section; he noted that the interiors are crowded with quartz grains averaging 0.05 mm in diameter and that the feldspar so common in the surrounding rhyolite is missing. Patton's findings suggest that a reaction of fluorine-rich fluids with the feldspar formed topaz and quartz in some manner similar to the formula:

8KA1Si30 8 +2F2+2Hz0-?4[Alz(F, OH)zSi04]

(sanidine)

(topaz)

+20SiOz+4K20+02 (quartz)

All gradations occur between clear and opaque crystals, and some crystals are clear at the ends that protrude into cavities but are opaque where they are attached to the sides of the cavities. In general, opaque crystals are larger than clear crystals and are commonly

To our knowledge the occurrence of beryl in rhyolite in the Thomas Range is unique in the United States.
The beryl occurs in small rose-red crystals whose only developed faces are the basal pinacoid and the

an inch or more in length. Opaque crystals tend to have simpler forms, and the prism, m(110), is the most common. In some specimens a second prism, 1(120), is present, and if terminated, the form is generally a simple pyramid, u(111). The opaque crystals occur in certain localities, just as the clear crystals do, and in some places the two are found together. Smooth opaque crystals were reported by Patton (1908, p. 186) and Montgomery (1935, p. 163) to occur in tuff. In-

Near Wildhorse Spring, however, beryl elongated in the direction of the c axis was found. Most of these crystals were less than 7 mm across and 8 mm high, but one crystal, the largest known from the Thomas Range, measured 13 mm across and 20 mm high (fig. 41, B).

in beryl (table 12) indicates, however, that the total effective alkali content is actually 1.6 percent. (The effective alkali content includes Na, Ca, Rb, and Li; it does not include 1\: because 1\: content of beryl does not affect the index of refraction.) Thus, these charts are not applicable for this particular beryl, and are probably not applicable to any beryl formed in rhyolite.
The spectrographic analysis (table 12) of the mino:r; element content of this beryl is distinctive from beryl found in other environments, and its content of a number of the minor elements is u,nique. This beryl in comparison to beryl from pegmatites, has a relatively low content of titanium, sodium, magnesium, and scandium; a relatively high content of barium and cesium; and one of the highest contents known of rubidium, iron, titanium, zinc, manganese, arsenic, boron, gallium, niobium, tin, yttrium, ytterbium, and zirconium. In contrast, beryl from pegmatites rarely contains any arsenic, boron, niobium, tin; yttrium, ytterbium, and zirconium; iron rarely exceeds 0.4 percent of the mineral; titanium makes up 0.003 percent or less; and zinc does not exceed 0.1 percent. The amount of rubidium in this beryl compares to the amount in beryl from lithium-rich cores of pegmatites.
Beryl in granite commonly is comparable in iron content, and beryl from granite on Mount Antero, Colo., and Sheeprock Mountains, Utah, and at Lone Pine, Calif., and Aqua Verde, Ariz., contains as much as 1.5 percent iron. The presence of abnormally high quantities of titanium, arsenic, manganese, zinc, iron, and rubidium probably reflects the difference in composition of the original material in ·which the b~ryl was formed. The composition of granitic pegmatltes is generally quite low in titanium, arsenic,. manganese,
zinc, and iron, and what little is present generally

Bixbyite was first described by Penfield and Foote (1897, p. 105-108) from original material found by Maynard Bixby. Bixbyite is much less eommon in the Thomas Range than topaz, and known localities are generally restricted to a few small areas ( 1) on the east side of the Thomas Range less than a mile north of Pismire Wash, which is probably the location of Maynard Bixby'$ original discovery, (2) at the north end of the Thomas Range ·over an area of about 1 square mile, (3) at the south end of the Thomas Range in Topaz Valley (Buranek, 1947, p. 40) , and (4) along the west side of the Thomas Range (Montgomery, 1935, p. 168).
Bixbyite is a rare mineral and has been described from only two other localities, (1) Ville de las Plumas, northern Patagonia (Cortellezzi, Himmel, and Schroeder, 1934, p. 129-135), and (2) the Black Range, New Mexico (Fries, Schaller, and Glass, 1942, p. 305-322). In both of these other areas it is associated with silicic volcanic rocks. The type of occurrence in the Black Range is ·almost identical to that in the Thomas
Range.· Bixbyite (Mn, Fe)203 is one of the few easily recog-
nizable manganese oxide minerals. It is isometric and forms simple cubes with a metallic luster in most areas (fig. 41), but in the northern part of the Thomas Range these ·cubes are com.monly modified by the tetragonal trisoctahedron, n (211) , and in a few places by an octahedron, o(111), which ~orms tiny faces beveling the tetragonal trisoctahedron. Although the bixbyite cubes are commonly less than 1 mm across, crystals as large as 6 mm across have been noted along the east side of the Thomas Rang~ (Montgomer;y, 1934, p. 84), and as large as 12 mm 1n the north-

principal elements, as well as the amounts of silicon and aluminum, are similar to those obtained by Foote (Penfield and Foote, 1897, p. 106) in a chemical analysis of bixbyite from the Thomas Range. The silicon and aluminum were believed present in impurities by Penfield and Foote (1897, p. 106) and by Fries, Schaller, and ·Glass (1942, p. 314), who made an analysis of bixbyite from the Black Range, New Mexico. The bixbyite used in the semiquantitative spectrographic analysis (table 13) was carefully hand picked under the microscope and is reasonably free of adhering impurities. The silicon and aluminum are believed by the writers to be part of the bix}?yite and may substitute in minor amounts for some of the other elements.
Although the presence of the manganese-bearing mineral. bixbyite might suggest that the rhyolite is manganese-rich, chemical analyses of four specimens (table 15, nos. 9-12) of the containing rhyolite show . a manganese content of only 0.03 to 0.05 percent. This amount of manganese is a little less than that of the average rhyolite (Washington, 1917, p. 114-141). Inasmuch as bixbyite occurs in cavities and along fractures, it may have been formed by late-stage manganese-rich fluids.
QUARTZ
Quartz, in addition to being an essential mineral in the rhyolite, lines the sides of some of the cavities and lithophysae in this rock. Quartz is perhaps equally as common in cavities as topaz, but because its crystals are small and clear it is easily overlooked or is mistaken for the associated topaz. Quartz is generally found as clear bipyramidal crystals as much as 1 mm across and locally as much as 5 mm across. At a few localities, such as near Wildhorse Spring, half a mile south of Colored Pass, and near.the upper part of the north fork of Pismire Wash, the quartz occurs in crystals that have a distinctive pale blue or purple color.
SPECULARITE
Specularite is perhaps as widely distributed throughout the range as the topaz with which it is commonly closely associated. The specularite is shiny, steely

black, and its crystals occur in paper-thin plates averaging about 1 mm in diameter. The crystals are hexagonal and are flattened parallel to the basal pinacoid. Specularite occurs in lithophysae and cavities, and commonly is found perched on topaz crystals, although in some places the specularite is included in the topaz crystals.
PSEUDOBROOKITE
Pseudobrookite is one of the rarest minerals occurring in the cavities. We did not see this mineral in place, but found several pieces in float near Wildhorse Spring and at the bixbyite locality on the east side of the Thomas Range. Pseudobrookite has been found in place, however, in Topaz Valley (Buranek, 1947, p. 39) and on the east side of the Thomas Range south of Pismire Wash (Montgomery, 1935, p. 165). Pseudobrookite was first found in the Thomas Range in 1934 by Edwin Over, and first described by Charles Palache (1934, p. 15) . This mineral is known in but a few other localities. Fries, Schaller, and Glass (1942, p. 317-318) listed 15 areas in which the mineral occurs, of wh!ch only four are in the United States.
Pseudobrookite (Fe20 3 •Ti02) occurs in black submetallic acicular crystals, which form radiating clusters. Most of the crystals are less than one-quarter of an inch long, but some as long as an inch have been reported (Montgomery, 1935, p. 166). Pseudobrookite lines cavities, particularly along fracture zones; it is commonly associated with specularite and less c.ommonly with topaz and beryl (Buranek, 1947, p. 39 ; Palache, 1934, p. 15) .
Pseudobrookite may be formed by sublimation, inasmuch as it has been found in the flues of furnaces in a soda factory (Doss, 1892, p. 569-584). This mineral is reported near conspicuous fractures in Topaz Valley (Buranek, 1947, p. 39) and along the east side of the Thomas Range (Edwin Over, Jr., .1954, oral communication), and fractures may have served as channels for iron- and titanium-bearing fluids. Possibly pseudobrookite was precipitated from vapors escaping from bodies of cooling lava and rising along
fractures.

Pale-green fluorescent hyalite opal forms veins at several localities, and is associated with uranium minerals at the Autunite No. 8 and Buena No. 1 properties.

Layers are from lJt inch to 2 feet thick and have a
dip as high as 9°. The strike and dip show considerable local variation and probably represent the initial attitude of the beds.
The sandstone is made up of angular to subrounded fragments, about half of which are of clear to brown glass. Some of the glass cont.ains numerous· small plagioclase microlites. Crystal fragments which make· up the other half of the rock include: hypersthene (15 percent), augite (10 percent), plagioclase (23 percent), and magnetite (2 percent). Although the plagioclase may have come from several sources and thus may have a variable anorthite content; most of the plagioclase has a fairly large extinction angle, and is probably similar in composition. Maximum extinction angles of 28°, which correspop.d to that of labradorite (An54 ), have been measured. The minerals and glass that make up this sandstone are identical to those found in the rhyodacite on which it is deposited. The sandstone was probably formed by erosion of the rhyodacite on the mountain above the present 5,250-foot level, and the deposition of the sand in a lake lying along its eastern side below the 5,250footlevel.
The quartz-sanidine sandstone is a white, lightgray, and yellowish-green friable rock with an average grain size of about 0.4 mm. Stratification is poor. The sand grains are angular to subrounded and consist chiefly of quartz and sanidine with minor amounts of plagioclase, biotite, and magnetite. A few lithic fragments of rhyodacite or porphyritic rhyolite are found. The matrix is chiefly clay with a little fine-grained calcite.
A more detailed description of this sandstone is given in the section on the Good vVill property.
The calcareous sandstone is a friable grayishorange to brown rock which consists of about 90 percent very fine sand-size particles. Although the rock is mainly sandstone, it conta;ins a few small conglom.eratic layers 1 to 8 inches thick. These layers contain subrounded to rounded pebbles, 1;4 to 2 inches in diameter, of rhyodacite, porphyritic rhyolite, obsidian, pumice, an aphanitic dark-gray volcanic rock, vitric tuff, and quartzite.
The sandstone is made up of about 37 percent mineral fragments, 20 percent glass, and 43 percent calcite. Angular to subrounded mineral fragments are quartz (15 percent), plagioclase (10 percent), potassium feldspar (5 percent), biotite (1 percent), and magnetite (1 percent), and less than 1 percent hornblende, augite, sphene, and zircon. The plagioclase probably came from more than one source, as it has a varia.ble anorthite content.

Glass is found in a variety of fragments ranging from clear through light brown to dark brown in color and from subrounded to angular in shape. Slender delicate Y-shaped shards are present in some places.
Irregular-shaped calcite grains make up much of the matrix of this rock. Calcite is not found in the matrix of the vitric tuffs that grade into the sandstone on the north and south; hence, the calcite was probably deposited from the lake water in which the sandstone was laid down..
CHEMICAL RELATIONS
Thirteen rock analyses of the volca:lllic rocks of the Thomas Range, have been made in the laboratories of the U.S. Geological Survey by L. M. l{ehl, E. J. Tomasi, and M. 1{. Balazs, are given in table 15, which also includes one previous analysis (Cross, 1886, p. 438) and the norms of all the analyzed rocks.
The volcanic rocks of the Thomas Range have a small range in chemical composition as compared with those of most other volcanic areas. All the rocks of the younger volcanic group, which makes up the greater part of the exposed volcanic material, conta1n between 69.79 and 76.54 percent silica and are rhyolitic in composition. In the rocks of the older volcanic group, the silica percentage ranges more widely-from 58.86 to 77.24 percent.
The chemical variations of individual volcanic rocks or groups of volcanic rocks are best shown by diagrams. ·Because of the restricted range in composition of the rocks of the Thomas Range, however, it is especially difficult to represent their chemical differences graphically. For this reason several kinds of diagrams were used for illustrating several kinds of differences between the ro~ks in tl1e Thomas Range and also for showing some of the broader differences between them and .the volcanic rocks of neighboring regions. One kind of diagram may show how the percentage of each component of a rock varies as the magma differentiates. Other· diagrams can show the differences in chemical composition between two groups of rocks as the magma differentiates, and still others consist of a series of points showing the spread of composition of the rocks under consideration.
All these diagrams are based on the assumption that the chemical analyses are accurate and that the chemical composition has not been changed by any secondary processes, such as silicification or weathering. Diagrams that show the change in chemical composition of rocks in one region as compared to those of another area are generally based on the assumption that all the rocks in one area are related.

In these· latter diagrams, it is also tacitly assumed that the rocks become younger as they become more silicic.
.In many regions not all these assumptions are valid. Inasmuch as the older and younger groups of volcanic rocks in the Thomas Range are of different ages, they are considered separately.
One of the most practical of the two-component variation diagrams in common use is the silica-variation diagram (figs. 42, 43) of the form proposed and applied by Harker (1900, p. 390; 1909, p. 118-146, 333-350). This diagram has the advantages of ease of construction, simplicity of chemical relations, and straightforwardness in graphical addition or subtraction; the only calculation involved is in changing all the Fe20a to· FeO, so that both iron oxides can be represented by a single curve. For some of ·the ·ox-

ides, there is a scattering of points allowing some 'latitude in the drawing of. the connecting curves. In the younger volcanic group this is true with CaO and Na20 (fig. 43) , but in general the position of the curves for these rocks is well controlled. In the older volcanic rocks a fairly wide scattering of points is noted at the silicic end, and the scarcity of points in this part of the graph does not allow for the accurate determination of the curve and for indicating· how much any particular rock differs from the average.
A general comparison can be made, however, between the two sets of curves (figs. 42 and 43) . Even assuming the widest variation possible in the curve for the older volcanic group, little similarity is noted. The curve for the Al20 3 in the younger group is .almost flat, whereas for the Alz03 in the older group it shows a steep drop toward the more siliceous ·end.

latter diagram is similar to that originally proposed by Poldervaart (1949, p. 177-188), but has been modified according to Coats (1953, p. 18-19), who added to the original FeO the amount of FeO corresponding to the Fe20s in the analysis. This is done because of the widespread inconsistency in degree of oxidation of iron in volcanic rocks. Both diagrams include nnalyses of five samples of rocks from the East Tintie mining district, Utah, obtained through the courtesy
of T. S. Lovering (1956, written communication),
and seven analyses representing Daly's averages (1933, p. 9-30).

Figure 44 shows a general decrease in CaO from the dark labradorite-rhyodacite (no. 1) to the porphyritic rhyolites (no. 5) in the older volcanic group; in the quartz-sanidine crystal tuff (no. 4) there is a significant variation from the general trend in the ratio between I\::20 and Na20, probably because this tuff contains fragments of sedimentary rocks. The rocks of the younger volcanic group are bunched close to Daly's average rhyolite, but. all except the vitric tuff contain the same or a less amount of CaO. The bunching of this group suggests that the original magma. was little differentiated. Rocks from the East Tintic district show little relation to either group of volcanic rocks from the Thomas Range.

the East Tintic district fall on or near a smooth

curve (solid) slightly convex toward the iron oxide

corner. In a series where iron enrichment has taken

place, the plotted points fall on a line above this

curve and are more sharply convex toward the iron

oxide corner. The symbols representing rocks of the

younger volcanic group form a small cluster on this

graph, but those representing rocks of the older

volcanic group from a curve (dashed) that diverges

considerably from the solid curve. This divergence is

not due to an excess of MgO but rather to a deficiency

of iron oxide.

Poldervaart (1949, p. 181) gave Daly's averages as

an example of a more salic type of roek. The curve

representing the older volcanic rocks of the Thomas

Range, however, is ··similar to that representing Daly's

averages, but falls below it and thus shows that the

Thomas Range rocks are more salic than Daly's aver-

age rocks.

From these four variation diagrams (figs. 42, 43,

44, and 45), it is possible to compare the general

order of crystallization in the various rocks of the

Thomas Range. The suffix "0" is attached in figures

44 and 45 to the numbers or names of all the rocks

belonging to the older volcanic group. The relative

ages of most rocks in the older volcanic group are too

uncertain to be discussed in relation to the chemical

composition of those rocks. The rhyodacites, however,

are known to be older than the porphyritic rhyolite,

and the variation diagrams show that they contain

considerably less Si02, Na20, K20 and more CaO, FeO, and MgO than the porphyritic rhyolites.

The relative ages of the younger volcanic rocks are

much better known, and are indicated in figures 43

and 44 by the letters "a" to "f," "a" representing the

oldest rock and "f" the youngest. Three analyses of

rocks that all came from a single flow are all marked

"e." In the silica-variation diagram (fig. 43) the

letters are plotted only on the Al20 3 curve, but the positions are the same on the other curves. In the

K20-Na20-Ca0 diagram (fig. 44) the letters are used as suffixes to the locality number. The age relations

between numbers of the younger group are not shown

on the other triangular variation diagram, because

most of the points representing analyses of the

younger volcanic rocks are so close together that they

are of no significance. On the o"ther two variation

diagrams, the random distribution, with respect to age,

of the points marked by the letters shows that no

systematic changes in the chemical composition of the

parent magma took place during the eruption of these

rocks. The primary differences between the members

of the younger volcanic group cannot, therefore, be

fully explained by fractional crystallization, which
operates as a function of time; they are probably due in the main to processes operating locally, such as assimilation or gaseous transfer.
A fifth variation diagram (fig. 46) was prepared in which the Si02 content of all the volcanic rocks in the Thomas Range is plotted against the "k" ratio-
the molecular ratio of K 20 to K20 + Na20. When
the' weight percent of K 20 and NazO are equal, the ''k" ratio is 0.4, and when it is higher, the weight percent of K20 exceeds that of Na20. The "k" ratio is higher than 0.4 in all these rocks.
The "k"-Si02 variation diagram was used by Merriam and Anderson (1942, p. 1723-1725) to compare the volcanic rocks of California, western Nevada, central Nevada, and Utah; many of the available analyses of these rocks list only the SiOz, N~O, and KzO content. Merriam and Anderson showed that the "k" ratio equals or exceeds 0.4 in most of the Utah volcanic rocks and is rather high in some of them; it is

GENERAL GEOLOGY

115

between 0.4 and 0.5 in most of the volcanic rocks of central Nevada, between 0.3 and 0.5 in most of the volcanic rocks of western Nevada, and less than 0.4 and usually less than 0.3 in most of the volcanic rocks of California. The average "k" ratio thus rises in general from west to east. The "k" ratios of rocks in the Thomas Range are generally high, like those compiled by J\{erriam and Anderson for rocks in other parts of Utah. Apparently, moreover, the I\:20 enrichment extends at least from central Nevada through western Utah and into parts of New 1\{exico (l\1erriam and Anderson, 1942, p. 1725; Nolan, 1935, .p. 50; Butler, Loughlin, Heikes, and others, 1920, p. 89; and Lindgren, Graton, and Gordon, 1910, p. 43-44). The reason for this regional abundance of 1(20 is not known. It cannot be explained simply as a result of local hydrothermal alteration, but must be due to some larger scale phenomenon, such as differences in the original composition of the magma between one region and the next. Such regional differences in the average composition of the volcanic rocks as the gradual rise in the "k" value from California to Utah may be commoner than previously suspected. The layers at depth, though probably much more uniform than those nearer the surface, may show gradational changes from one region to the next. Material erupted from these deeper layers would show similar differences which, when modified by such factors as fractional crystallization and assimilation, would show up in the volcanic rocks on the surface.
URANIUM CONTENT OF THE VOLCANIC ROCKS
The uranium content of fresh unaltered· volcanic rocks from the younger volcanic group is at least three times that of the average rhyolitic rock.
Equivalent uranium and uranium contents of 25 volcanic rocks are compiled in table 16. The equivalent uranium content represents a radiometric .measurement based on the assumption that all the radiation comes from the daughter products of uranium, and that these daughter products are in equilibrium with the uranium. If other radioactive substances such as thorium or I\:+40 are present or if the uranium is not in equilibrium with its daughter products, then the assumption is erroneous.. The uranium content is determined by chemical methods and represents the true amount of uranium in the sample, irrespective of the amount of radiation.
The equivalent uranium content in most of the rocks of the Thomas Range (table 16) is higher than the uranium content. The difference can be explained by the presence of the radioactive potassium isotope K+40 and of thorium.

The average uranium analyses of all the volcanic rocks was 0.004 percent equivalent uranium and 0.002 percent uranium. These analyses were also grouped according to rock type and averaged (table 17). Many of the rock types are represented by too few specimens to give a ,good overall average, but nevertheless a significant difference is seen between rocks of the older and the younger volcanic groups.
Individually, rocks of the older volcanic group have a uranium content of 0.002 or lower; rocks of the younger volcanic group have a uranium content that ranges from 0.001 to 0.006. .Hence, rocks with a uranium content of 0.003 percent or higher probably belong to the younger volcanic group.

GEOLOGY AND MINERAL DEPOSITS, THOMAS AND DUGWAY RANGES, UTAH

A comparison of the uranium content of the volcanic rocks in the Thomas Range with that of similar rocks in other parts of the United States is difficult o'wing to the lack of sufficient reliable data. To obtain a general average, the authors compiled analyses of 64 samples of rhyolite and rhyolitic glass collected by R. R. Coats, of the U.S. Geological Survey, in Nevada, Oregon, Idaho, \Vyoming, Montana, Washington, California, Arizon~, Colorado, and Utah. The average of these rockb is not representative of the entire United States, and, because the samples do not represent proportionately the amount of volcanic rocks in each State, they are not truly representative of western United States. The 64 samples, however, were collected from 40 different counties, and the selection may be large enough and widely enough scattered to give a fair approximation of the average uranium content of the rhyolitic rocks in this region. The uranium content of these 64 samples ranges from 0.0002 to 0.0090 percent, and averages 0.0007 percent. This figure is nearly the same as the average we obtained for the rocks of the <;>lder volcanic group. The rocks of the younger volcanic group, with an average of 0.003 percent uranium, contain roughly three times as much uranium as the average rhyolitic rock in weste~ United States. Concentrations of this magnitude are probably significant, and areas surrounding bodies of igneous rock with such a uranium content would seem favorable for seeking new ore deposits.
AGE OF THE VOLCANIC ROCKS
The age of the volcanic rocks determined from the overlying and underlying rocks ranges from Pleistocene to post-Middle Mississippian. The only fossils found in the volcanic rocks were petrified logs, which were not well enough preserved to date closer than post-Devonian.
The Larsen radioactive-decay method of determining age (Larsen, Keevil, and Harrison, 1952), however, indicated about 19 million years or middle Tertiary and probably Miocene according to Holmes, time scale B for a rock in the older volcanic group. The analysis was made by H. W. Jaffe, of the U.S. Geological Survey, on zircon recovered from two specimens of quartz-sanidine welded crystal tuff collected about 1,900 feet northwest of Colored Pass. Both specimens had an alpha activity of 552 a per mg per hr; one contained 4.3 ppm lead and the other 4.5. Average fig~re of 4.4 ppm lead was used in the age calculation.
The age of volcanic rocks elsewhere in west-.central Utah has not been conclusively determined," except in the Long Ridge area west of Nephi where Muessig

(1951, p. 234) found middle or late early Eocene plant fossils in limestone interbedded with volcanic rocks. At Gold Hill the volcanic rocks were tentatively assigned to the late Pliocene (Nolan, 1935, p. 53) on the basis of geomorphic evidence. Thus in a distance of about 100 miles, ages of volcanic rocks may range from Eocene through Pliocene; this range indicates that volcanism in western Utah probably occurred during most of the Tertiary.
The younger group of volcanic rocks in the Thomas Range has not yet been dated. Through indirect reasoning, however, it is possible to show that these rocks are probably Pliocene in age. Inasmuch as they overlie the older volcanic group of rocks, the younger volcanic group of rocks can not be older than Miocene, and because they are overlain by Lake Bonneville sediments, they can not be younger than Pleistocene. Three lines of evidence suggest there was a significant time interval between the emplacement of the older and younger groups. First, it is fairly certain that the younger group was emplaced after the major part of Basin and Range faulting tilted and uplifted the Paleozoic and older volcanic rocks; second, the younger group lies upon an irregular erosion surface cut on the older rocks; and third, an oxidized red conglomerate is present locally between the Paleozoic rocks and the base of the younger group. Thus, the younger lavas as a whole are flat-lying and are little disturbed by faulting, although structural features within the flows, such as flow banding, show steep and diverse dips; nowhere do the flows dip as steeply as the Paleozoic and older volcanic rocks. In some places the lavas extend across faults without evident displacement, as in the central part of the Dugway Range where the extensions of numerous southward-trending faults are not evident in the younger volcanic flows. In the southwestern part of the Dugway Range a reddish-brown conglomerate consisting chiefly of waterlaid sand, pebbles, and cobbles of the Paleozoic rocks, and a few pieces of rhyodacite apparently rests on Paleozoic rocks and is overlain by rhyolite. Its red color indicates a high state of oxidation, that suggests a period of weathering. This red conglomerate is believed to be a fanglomerate deposited during erosion after the major part of Basin and Range faulting and prior to extrusion of the younger rhyolites. The red color is present everywhere the conglomerate is exposed and did not result from Recent weathering. Van Houten (1956), who summarized the stratigraphy of Cenozoic sedimentary and volcanic rocks of
Nevada and northwestern Utah, pointed out that in east-central Nevada and northwestern Utah a widespread fairly well dated (upper Miocene to lower and

GENERAL GEOLOGY

117

middle Pliocene) unit, which he called the "vitric tuff unit," is unconformably underlain by undated "reddish-brown and tan conglomerate and breccia containing pebbles and cobbles derived from Paleozoic rocks" (Van I-Iouten, 1956, p. 2806). Although in most areas where they have been described these rocks are much thicker than the conglomerates in the Dugway Range, their lithology and stratigraphic position are similar.
If the foregoing conclusions are correct, we must allow time for some faulting and tilting and for a period of considerable erosion and weathering after eruption of the older volcanic group and before extrusion of the younger lavas. It seems reasonable to assume that the earliest date for deposition of the younger group of lavas is early Pliocene.
By similar reasoning, we may ·put an upper date on the younger rhyolite. As can be seen from plate 1, the top of the Thomas Range is a fairly flat, partly dissected upland, which appears in g~neral to represent the top of the youngest flows. The upper surface of the rhyolite has a vesicular mid locally glassy appearance over wide areas, and is the almost uneroded top of a flow. There has been some dissection of this surface, however, as shown by the isolated remnants of what may be the same uppermost flow; a small remnant is preserved near the center of the range north of Colored Pass, and a larger one in the north-central part of the range. Locally some deep valleys have been cut in the flanks of the rhyolite masses, but structural evidence indicates that these valleys are in the same general position as those formed before the latest flow and that they were probably only partly filled by earlier flows. Because the amount of erosion is slight to locally moderate, the length of time in which erosion took place was probably also moderate, and the youngest age for the younger lavas could reasonably be late Pliocene.
To suspend so many assumptions on one zircon age date is perhaps highly presumptive, but, lacking better evidence, the foregoing tentative conclusions are offered as the best currently available;
.SUMMARY pF VOLCANIC HISTORY
Many areas of uncertainty in the volcanic history of the Thomas and Dugway Ranges have been pointed out in the detailed descriptions above. Despite these shortcomings, the following summary of the volcanic history may be deciphered from the known facts.
The first volcanic activity probably took place in early l\1iocene time, when rhyodacite and probably rhyodacite breccia and associated tuffs were intruded and deposited upon Paleozoic sedimentary rocks. At about the same time, or soon after, pyroclastic material was erupted from several vents along the east

side of the Thomas Range. The Black Rock Hills were at least partly under water during this time, inasmuch as a rhyodacitic sandstone was deposited along the lower parts of the hills. This sandstone was deposited before all the rhyodacite was emplaced, because it is cut by a small rhyodacite dike.
After eruption of the rhyodacite, a series of rhyolitic volcanics were emplaced, probably in middle l\1iocene time. A number of different types of crystal tuffs, each related to one or more vents, were probably formed first, and they are scattered throughout this region. l\1ost of these rocks were deposited subaerially, but sandstone was deposited locally in a small lake on the west site of the Thomas Range. Porphyritic rhyolite was then intruded into the Paleozoic sedimentary and older volcanic rocks. The upper . parts of some of these rhyolite bodies reached the surface. Intrusive breccia probably was the last rock in the older volcanic group to be formed. The rocks of the older volcanic group were then uplifted, tilted, and eroded to a mature surface.
A second period of volcanism followed, probably in Pliocene time, during which successive sequences of eruption produced vitric tuff, breccia, and rhyolite in that order. This same succession was repeated five times; slight erosion occurred locally between deposition of some of these subgroups. The first two subgroups were erupted in the southern part of the Dugway Range; the later ones were more widespread and occurred mainly in the Thomas Range. In general the volcanism started in the north and shifted southward with time. The rhyolite flowed out from five major centers and a number of small ones. The northernmost major center was Pyramid Peak in the southern part of the Dugway Range, and the southernmost one was Topaz Mountain. The five main centers of eruption form a rough north-south line near the center of the Thomas and Dugway ·Ranges. During and following the rhyolite eruptions, green glass filled fissures or vents and remelted and assimilated wall rock. Hence, areas of green glass mark some of the numerous fissures which served as passageways for . the molten lava.
The volcanic centers were repeatedly active during the eruption of the various subgroups, and some centers were the source of material for at least three separate subgroups. In most places the materiaJ which formed the pyroclastic rocks was thrown out of vents
which probably lay on a line about 1 mile west of the volcanic centers from which the rhyolite issued. At
Pyramid Peak, however, both rhyolite and pyroclastic sediments appear to have come from the same or
closely adjoining vents.

ROCKS OF QUATERNARY AGE

LAKE BONNEVILLE BEDS

Distribution.-At the time of greatest extent of Pleistocene Lake Bonneville, about one-half of the area mapped was beneath water. Virtually all the intermontane area adjoining the Thomas and Dugway Ranges is underlain by poorly consolidated sediments deposited in this lake. The maximum elevation of these rocks is about 5,200 feet, the height of the . highest or Bonneville shoreline as described by Gilbert (1890, p. 93-126). The Lake Bonneville beds (Gilbert, 1875, p. 94) are most conveniently described by placing them in three categories: (1) clay and marl, (2) sand and gravel, and (3) tufa and associated conglomerate.
Cl~y and marl beds occupy topographically low parts of basins and are best exposed (pl. 1) in the valleys between the eastern part of the Thomas Range and the Black Rock Hills, and in the valley of Pismire Wash between the Thomas and Dugway Ranges on the west and Keg Mountains on the east.
Sand and gravel deposited by Lake Bonneville are widely distributed; commonly, these deposits form shoreline features such as beaches, spits and bars. Gravel bars occur across the mouths of many valleys and canyons, and are well-exposed where they have been breached by erosion. A long bar lies across the valley between Antelope Ridge and the hill to the east; behind it is a small playa. The largest bar in this area is on the northwestern end of Spor Mountain, is semicircular in shape, about 50 feet high, and half a mile long. Gravel, sand, and conglomerate overlie the marls in many areas, but the coarse material is difficult to distinguish from later alluvium.
Tufa and tufa-cemented conglomerate are restricted
to the shorelines of Lake Bonneville, chiefly at the outer edges of the 5,200-focit Bonneville and 4,800-
foot Provo terraces. The tufa-cemented conglomerate
is conspicuous on outcrops of Paleozoic rocks on the south side of Spor Mountain and on the east side of
the Black Rock Hills. Lithology.-Marl and clay deposits consist of white
to yellow fine-grained soft clay of variable carbonate

Lohman, were found in the fine fractions of sample 2 (table 18). The most abundant of these was Suirella testudo Ehrenberg. Other diatoms i~ this sample included Epithemia turgida ICiitzing, Oymbella mexiaana (Ehrenberg) Cleve, and Navicula oblonga ICiitzing.
According to Lohman, "* * * deposition in a shal-
low, cool to cold saline lake is indicated by these diatoms" (1956, written communication).
Sand and gravel beds deposited by Lake Bonneville are mostly incoherent and well sorted, and contain subangular to well-rounded sand- to boulder-size pieces of locally derived rocks. These .beds make up .the greater part of the exposures in the area mapped.
Well-indurated tufa-cemented conglomerate, a few inches to 4 feet thic:K, contains angular to rounded rock fragments. Tan massive tufa with only a few rock particles occurs locally; this rock is highly porous and has an extremely rough, irregular surface.
Tenaaes.-The three major shorelines of Lake Bonneville present in this area are the Bonneville, Provo,
and Stansbury. Wave-cut terraces of the Bonneville
or highest shoreline are well exposed on an isolated
hill directly south of Spor Mountain and on the north-
west extremity of the Dugway Range. The Provo shoreline terrace is conspicuous along the northwest
sides of the Thomas and Dugway Ranges (fig. 48B)
and in the Black Rock Hills. The Stansbury shoreline terrace is exposed only at
the northwest tip of the Dug~ay Range. It may be

traced southwestward from this point as a strand line crossing the alluvium to the northern end of the Black Rock Hills.
Aerial photographs show a remarkable series of evenly spaced minor shorelines on the alluvial fans on the southwest flank of the Dugway Range. These features were probably caused by short stillstands of the lake during its recession from the Provo to the Stansbury.
ALLUVIUM
The valleys and flats in and around the Thomas and Dugway Ranges are covered with alluvium of Quaternary age. Below 5,200 feet the alluvium overlies the Lake Bonneville sediments, and it is difficult to distinguish between them. Alluvial fans composed of sand, gravel, and boulders washed down from the mountains are present but are not as well developed as in some other desert ranges. Alluvial cover extends up some of the valleys for long distances, as in Pismire Wash in the Thomas Range and in Fandangle Canyon in the Dugway Range. Talus and slope wash are common at the base of some of the rhyolite cliffs in the Thomas Range. ·Windblown sand and silt a few inches to several feet thick are present in s~me ·areas ·on the larger flats.
STRUCTURE
The Thomas and Dugway Ranges are part of a long uplift that includes Granite Mountain to the north and the Drum and Little Drum Mountains to the south. The individual ranges that make up this uplift trend northwest, whereas most of the other ranges in this part of the Great Basin trend north or north-northeast. The uplift is composed of segments containing ·Paleozoic and possibly Precambrian sedimentary rocks tilted to the west and northwest, granitic rocks of unknown age and structure (Granite Mountain) , and flat-lying volcanic rocks of Tertiary age. The Paleozoic rocks are highly faulted; the volcanic rocks, particularly the younger group, are for the most part unfaulted. Folding, though present, is of minor importance.
Four general episodes in the structural history are recognized : (1) an early period or periods of compression that formed thrust faults, possibly a few transverse faults, and gentle minor folds, (2) a peri9d in which hundreds of diversely oriented transverse and strike faults were formed, (3) a period in which the mountains were elevated and tilted by Basin and Range faults, and (4) a later period during which eruption of the major part of the volcanic rocks, followed by minor faulting, took place. These periods overlapped to some extent, and renewed movement

probably occurred on some faults. The following description of structural features is based on the above episodes.
COMPRESSIONAL FEATURES
At least one and possibly several periods of compression are recorded in the Thomas and Dugway Ranges by thrust faults and minor folds. These structures are displaced by younger faults.
The average strike of the sedimentary rocks in the area rnapped is almost north, but varies between about N. 35° E. on Spor Mountain and about N. 20° W. in the northern part of the Dugway Range. The average dip is about 35° but ranges from about 10° to 65°. It is westerly, except in a few areas. Rock attitudes that do not conform to the regional pattern are commonly due to rotation of fault blocks or to drag along faults.
The only large-scale fold in the Thomas or Dugway Ranges is a gentle syncline whose axis trends from east to northeast along Buckhorn Canyon in the northeastern part of the Dugway Range (pl. 1). This fold plunges about 15° W., and the dips range from about 15° near the axis to about 40° on the south limb. It is terminated on the west by the Buckhorn thrust fault. South of the mouth of Gilson Canyon, beds of the Sevy dolomite and Engelmann formation strike more eastward and dip northward as they approach the Buckhorn thrust (pl. 1) . This fold is due to large-scale lateral drag ori the thrust fault.
Gentle folds, characterized by low dips and variable strikes, are present in the southern Black Rock Hills and on the west side of the Dugway Range, but no distinct pattern could be distinguished in these areas.
Minor folds less than 200 feet across . are fairly common in the thin-bedded parts of the Trailer limestone, Woodman formation, and Garden City formation. A few folds of this type are present southwest of the head of Bullion Canyon.
One large and four very small thrust faults have been mapped in the Dugway and Thomas Ranges; a few other faults whose traces are sinuous may also be thrusts. In general these faults dip steeply, as much
as 58° in places.
Th~· largest thrust fault is named the Buckhorn from exposures near the head of Buckhorn Canyon (pl. 1, 6). It extends about 6.5 miles northwestward from Fandangle Canyon to a point about 1.5 miles northwest of the Four Metals mine, where it disappears beneath the alluvium near the north end of the Dugway Range. In addition, the Buckhorn thrust
fault probably extends southward for at least 3 miles along the west side of Fandangle Canyon.

Northwest of Fandangle Canyon the Buckhorn thrust dips northeast and brings Devonian and Mississippian rocks over Cambrian rocks. Along the west side of Fandangle Canyon the fault dips east and brings Ordovician and Silurian rocks over Cambrian rocks. Only three good exposures of the thrust plane are known. One is at Engelmann Canyon where the Engelmann formation is thrust over the Fandangle limestone and the fault dips 47° NE. Another is on the. west side of Fandangle Canyon where silicified Paleozoic rocks rest on .the Fandangle limestone and the thrust dips 58° E. The best exposure is about 5,500 feet N. 64° W. of the Four ::Metals mine in a small ravine north of the mapped area, where limestone, probably the Madison equivalent, is thrust over the Prospect Mountain quartzite; here the fault dips 20° N.E., and slickensides on the underlying quartzite plunge about 20° N. 50° E. A dip of 34° E. was measured on the map at the point where the fault crosses the divide between Fandangle Canyon and Green Grass Valley.
Parts of the thrust plane are poorly exposed and are masked by silicified rock in down-faulted segments in the Bertha 'trough (section A.-A.'; pl. 2) . In l{ellys Hole the thrust plane is also down-faulted on normal faults along the sides of this graben (fig_. 48), and lies below the surface. A small remnant of dolomite of probable ~fississippian age occurs north of the mapped area high on the side of the ridge of Prospect ~foun­ tain quartzite 2,000 feet northwest of the Black ~{aria shaft. This dolomite is apparently an erosional remnant of the upper plate of the thrust that has been
preserved by down faulting. In the Kellys Hole area the Buckhorn thrust fault
brings the Ochre Mountain limestone (Upper 1\tiississippian) over the Prospect Mountain quartzite (Lower
Cambrian) ; this overthrusting results in the omission of at least 15,000 feet of beds. ·The total thickness of the beds omitted, however, may be several thousand
feet greater, inasmuch as an unknown thickness of the Prospect Mountain quartzite is cut out.. In the Kellys Hole area, the fault is probably near the base of the Ochre Mountain limestone, but eastward it cuts downward through the Woodman formation, Madison limestone equivalent, and probably the formations of Late Devonian age (section A.-A.', pl. 2). The dip of these beds in the upper plate flattens as the thrust plane is
approached, and in some places the beds are nearly parallel with the plane. This feature is well exposed in the area between Fandangle and Engelmann Canyons (pl. 1) . Near the head of Fandangle Canyon the stratigraphic displacement is about 5,000 feet; in

that area the Ordovician Garden City formation is thrust over the Cambrian Fandangle limestone.
Although the true nature of the Buckhorn fault is by no means clear, the available evidence appears to favor a thrust. At least two possibilities may be considered, however: (1) that it is a thrust of moderate dip as shown on plate 2, sections A-A', B-B', and 0-0', or (2) that it is a low-angle normal fault.
Features that suggest that the Buckhorn fault is a thrust are (1) a moderately low dip which in one place is 20°, (2) the large stratigraphic displacement, particularly in the northern part of the fault, where the minimum displacement is estimated at 15,000 feet,

(3) the presence at the surface in the Bertha and Kellys Hole grabens of rocks of the same age, and (4) the necessity of having a heave of at least 30,000 feet (assuming an average dip of the fault of 30°) if the fault is normal. On the other hand, the obviously lower elevation east of the fault of the younger rocks relative to the older suggests that it could be a lowangle normal fault.
The folds in the hanging wall of the Buckhorn fault may have been produced by a period of strikeslip movement in which the east side of the fault moved relatively southeastward as a result of compression from the northwest. Such compression could also account for the Buckhorn syncline.
All the other faults mapped as thrusts are in the Spor Mountain area (pl. 1 and 6). One is near the northwest end of Spor Mountain, two others are exposed on the west side of Eagle Rock Ridge, and one is at the south end of Spor Mountain. These faults dip westward and have a dip-slip movement of less than 1,000 feet; at the surface they are confined to rocks of Silurian age.
The hanging-wall side of the Buckhorn thrust, which includes the eastern and northeastern parts of the Dugway Range, is much less faulted than the footwall side. Similarly, the Black Rock Hills contain few faults compared to Spor Mountain. This sudden change in pattern in fault density has raised the possibility of a thrust separating these two areas and trending northward along the west side of the Dugway Range. No evidence for this fault other than the change in fault densities is known, but, because this area is thickly mantled with Lake Bonneville sediments, additional evidence would undoubtedly be hidden. If such a thrust fault exists, it might possibly be a down-faulted segment of the Buckhorn thrust.
South and east of Kellys Hole are northeast-trending transverse faults that separate the Prospect Mountain quartzite from the Cambrian and Ordovician carbonate rocks. The irregular traces of these faults and one recorded dip of 43° SE. suggest that they may be steep thrust planes. It is also possible that they are strike-slip faults produced by the same period of compression that caused the Buckhorn thrust fault. Some of the other transverse northeast-trending faults in the central Dugway Range may also be related to early compression.
Compressional features of the Thomas and Dugway Ranges have no consistent orientation, and therefore do not suggest a simple stress pattern. The
trends of the two largest structures, the Buckhorn syncline and thrust fault, are nearly at right angles.

122

GEOLOGY AND MINERAL DEPOSITS, THOMAS AND DUGWAY RANGES, UTAH

Thrust faults on Spor Mountain dip in the opposite direction from the Buckhorn thrust. The possible transverse thrust or strike-slip faults south of Kellys Hole are parallel to the Buckhorn syncline, but they are nearly at right angles to the Buckhorn thrust. T~e inconsistent orientation of these structures suggests compression in several directions at different times.
TRANSVERSE AND STRIKE FAULTS

Hundreds of steep transverse and strike faults cut

the Paleozoic rocks in the Thomas and Dugway

Ranges. Even though these faults are all discussed

together, the possibility that some of them are related

to the previous compressional episode should be kept

in mind. For convenience in discussion, the area has

been divided into blocks (pl. 6), which, though arbi-

trary to some extent, encompass areas having some-

what different fault patterns. The blocks are bounded

in most place$ by major faults, principally of the

Basin and Range type, which are discussed on page

126. In addition, the large area of volcanic rocks is

considered as a separate block inasmuch a~ it is com-

paratively little disturbed by faulting; however, it is

probably underlain by highly faulted Paleozoic rocks.

The structure of the volcanic rocks is discussed on

page 128.

·

Considering the area as a whole, several a..')pects of

the transverse and strike faults are ev~dent (pl. 1) :

First; coincidentally or not, these faults are most nu-

merous in rocks of Silurian and Middle and Late

Ordovician age in the Spor ~fountain and Castle

Mountain blocks; and although there are hundreds

of faults in these two areas, most of them have dis-

placements of less than 500 feet (pl. 2). Second, it

. is equally apparent that nearby areas such as the

northern parts of the Dugway Ridge and Black Rock

Hills blocks and the eastern part of the Buckhorn

block are comparatively unfaulted. Third, strike

faults occur mainly in the Spor Mountain block.

Fourth, the transverse faults show no consistent re-

gional trend or offset pattern between one block and

the next. Fifth, transverse and strike faults offset

the large faults that bound the blocks in only a few

places.

The first of the foregoing general statements should

be qualified to some extent. In part, the con~entra­

tion of faults in Upper Ordovician and Silurian rocks

is only apparent, because formations of this age are

comparatively thin and small faults are more readily

discerned. In addition, large areas of Cambrian and

Lower Ordovician rocks in the north-central Dugway

Range are dolomitized; hence, recognition of faults

and formations is more difficult. Rocks of Devonian

and Early Mississippian age, however, have not been extensively dolomitized, and faults are scarce in rocks of this age.
The foregoing observations suggest that each structural block of the Thomas and Dugway Ranges has acted more or less independently during the formation of the transverse and strike faults and that lines of weakness that later guided· many of the faults that bound the blocks existed for some time before the main movement occurred along them.
SPOR MOUNTAIN BLOCK
Details of the structure of the Spor Mountain area have been described elsewhere (Staatz and. Osterwald, 1959, p. 42-45), and only a summary of the important features is included here.
The Spor Mountain block, which includes the area of Spor Mountain, Eagle Rock Ridge, and the low hills to the south and west (pl. 6) is, the most highly faulted of the eight blocks; nearly 1,000 faults were mapped (Staatz and Osterwald, 1959, pl. 1), but only the more important of these are shown on plate 1. Displacement along these faults is generally moderate, and only a few have a displacement of as much as 1,000 feet. Northeast-trending strike faults form the dominant structural feature of the Spor Mountain block, and, together with faults of several other trends, result in a mosaic outcrop pattern (pl. 1) resembling shattered glass.
The sequence of sedimentary rocks on Spor Mountain is repeated (pl. 2, E-E', fig. 49) many times by the strike faults. The Harrisite dolomite, for example, is repeated 11 times in less than 4 miles.
The transverse and strike faults in the Spor Mountain block have been grouped in three sets (Staatz and Osterwald, 1959, p. 43-44) from older to younger: (1) northeast-trending normal and reverse strike faults, with moderate dip, (2) northwest-trending transverse faults, mostly high angle, and (3) easttrending transverse faults. The first two fault sets are prevolcanic, but some faults of the last set cut and displace rocks belonging to the older volcanic group. Bodies of intrusive breccia are common along the northeast-trending strike faults in this area (fig. 49).
BLACK ROCK HILLS BLOCK
The Black Rock Hills and the low hills to the southeast make up a structural block composed of Upper Devonian rocks.
The Black Rock Hills show the same scarcity of transverse faults as the western part of the Spor Mountain block. The rocks north of Goshoot Canyon strike north and dip about 20° W. and are un-

broken except for one east-trending fault of moderate displacement. Strikes and dips south of Goshoot Canyon average N. 81° W. and 15° S., respectively, but the strikes vary from west through north to northeast and the dips from 6° to 20° south and west. Rocks in the southern Black Rock Hills are cut by several west- or northwest-trending faults of small displacement and steep to moderate southerly dip. Repetition of beds in the southeastern Black Rock Hills suggests the presence of .a northeast-trending fault with moderate throw under the alluvium between the hills.
CASTLE MOUNTAm BLOCK
The large Castle Mountain block occupies the westcentral part of the Dugway Range; it is bounded by the volcanic rocks on the south, upper Fandangle Canyon on the east, the Buckhorn thrust fault on the northeast, transverse faults south of Kellys Hole on the northwest, and the range front on the southwest. Rocks of Cambrian through Silurian age occupy most of this block, but Devonian rocks crop out on low hills in the northwest corner. The prevailing strike of beds is north, but northwest and northeast strikes are found in some areas. The average dip is about 35° W.
The Castle Mountain block is complexly faulted, and parts of it show a pattern like that of the Spor
712-190 0-64--9

Mountain block, though strike faults are less common. Faults are difficult fo trace in many parts of the block because there are large areas of nondistinctive dolomitized rock, or rather tmiform carbonate rock, as in the Garden City formation and Fandangle limestone. As shown by sections B-B' and 0-0' (pl. 2) , the block consists of several smaller bloclrs bounded by large normal faults. Within these smaller blocks are many normal faults, and a few reverse faults whose combined effect is to repeat the Ordovician and Silurian rocks. This pattern is most evident just northwest of the north edge of the volcanic rocks and 1.5 miles west of Castle Mountain.
Most of the faults in the block strike northeast, north, or northwest, though some do not fit into any of the above sets. No consistent pattern of offset is apparent, but in general the northwest-trending set is the youngest, and the large faults of this group are part of the younger Basin and Range fault system discussed on page 126. Most of the faults within
the block are normal and dip between 55° and 80°. Faults of the sparsely developed northeast-trending
set are in general the oldest and show the smallest displacement, although there are many exceptions; commonly they die out in short distances or are terminated or offset by the other faults. Such relations are well shown in the area about 1.5 miles west-south-

124

GEOLOGY AND MINERAL DEPOSITS, THOMAS AND DUGWAY RANGES, UTAH

west of Castle Mountain where a small northeasttrending fault separates the Harrisite and Bell Hill dolomites.. It is offset twice by small northwest-trending faults and is terminated by a north-trending fault. Northeast-trending faults that die out within several hundred yards can be seen on a ridge about 0.7 mile southwest of peak 6775 (pL 1) near the south end of the block, where they displace the contact between the Thursday and Lost Sheep dolomites.
Most of the north-trending faults have displacements of several hundred feet or more. In general they are persistent steep normal west-dipping faults that commonly end only against the major northwesttrending faults (pl. 1 and 2). This group of faults most nearly approaches the strike of the sedimentary rocks a;nd is mainly responsible for the repetition of formations in areas such as those at the south· end of the Castle Mountain block on both sides of the narrow capping of rhyolite that marks the northern end of the rhyolite flows. Other groups of faults belonging to the north-trending set are seen on Castle l\1ountain, to the west of Castle Mountain, and in the area south of the head of Bullion Canyon.
Northwest-trending faults are the most conspicuous in the block and in many places are the youngest, because they commonly offset faults of the other two groups.. The most important ones are of the Basin and Range type (p. 126). Many smaller faults of northwest trend are present throughout the block, but are most numerous in the Silurian and Ordovician rocks in the areas 1.5 miles west and 1 mile southwest of Castle Mountain. A few small faults of northwest trend split from, or terminate against, north-trending faults.
Several important faults in the block are difficult to assign to any of the three sets because they curve, or because their strike is intermediate between the three principal directions. One such fault cuts diagonally across the block from the west edge of the
range south of Castle Mountain northwestward and north to the Buckhorn thrust fault at a point about
1.5 miles northwest of the head of Engelmann Canyon. South and west of Castle Mountain this fault separate~ Silurian from Lower Ordovician rocks in most pl.aces; northwest of Castle Mountain Cambrian rocks occur on both sides of it; it is probably a highangle reverse fault (section B-B', pl. 2), but exposures of the fault plane are poor. Another important fault of this type separates Ordovician and Silurian rocks from Cambrian rocks in the southern part of the block. It begins ·near the west edge of
the range about 0.8 mile southwest of peak 6,775 and

is traceable in a northeasterly direction nearly to Fandangle Canyon with numerous offsets on northwest- and north-trending faults.
Two isolated slivers of Garden City formation, 2,000 to 2,500 feet long and a few feet to 250 feet wide, are enclosed by branching faults in the squthern part of the block. One sliver lies 600 feet west of peak 6,401 and 1.2 miles southeast of Castle Mountain, the other lies 3,000 feet west of peak 6,775. The faults bounding these slices dip eastward, appear to be normal and almost parallel, and· show opposite relative movement (section 0-0', pl. 2), but one fault is of larger displacement than the other.
~UGWAY RIDGE BLOCK
The Dugway Ridge block, which extends along the east side of the Dugway Range from the Fandang]e fault southward to the knolls southeast of Dugway Pass (pl. 6), is one of the least faulted of the structural blocks. For this reason and because of the steepness of its eastern escarpment, it contains some of the best exposures in the Thomas and Dugway Ranges. The beds strike north throughout the block, and dip from about 45° W. in the northern part to about 35° W. in the southern part. Most of the faults, which increase slightly in number to the south, are steep normal faults transverse to the strike of the · beds and to Dugway Ridge. A few low-angle normal faults, some of which are strike faults, occur in the southern part of the block. Many of the small faults die out within a few hundred feet.
One of the largest faults in the block is 1,500 feet south of Dugway Pass; it trends nearly west and dips 65° S. It offsets the Cambrian rocks and also cuts and displaces the volcanic rocks of the younger group. This fault is paralleled in Dugway Pass by a smaller fault that offsets Cambrian formations about 1,000 feet. Other similar faults of smaller displacement are present in the vicinity of Shadscale .Canyon, Trailer Wash, and Fera Canyon. Most of these dip moderately to steeply northward. The northwesttrending oblique fault in Straight Canyon is believed to be part of the Basin and Range fault system; it is discussed on page 126. A northwest-trending fault about a mile north of Fera Canyon slices through the Fandangle formation and ends against the large Fandangle fault. The concentration of small faults in the Fish Haven dolomite and Swan Peak formation near the northwest corner of the block may be a result of adjustments to the change in strike of the Buckhorn thrust.

The beds dip 25° to 35° W. in much of the block, but near the Buckhorn thrust and along the Buckhorn syncline the strike and dip are variable.
Compared to the Fandangle block, dips of the rocks :in tl1e Buckhorn are lower, and faults, though less numerous, are more divers~ly oriented. In number and pattern of faults the Buckhorn is most like the Black

BASIN AND RANGE FAULTS
Faults of the Basin and Range type were formed during the third structural episode in the Thomas and Dugway Ranges and include most of the large faults in the area. Elevation of the mountains resulted from uplift on many of these faults, which in most places form the boundaries between the structural blocks, as previously described.
Faults discussed here generally have the following features in common: (1) they are major persistent structural breaks with· displacements amounting to more than 300 feet ; (2) they are normal faults ; (3) they trend either north or N. 45°-65° W.; (4) they terminate virtually all other structures; (5) they have good topographic expression; and (6) they divide parts of the ranges into large tilted blocks.
All the major Basin and Range faults, both exposed and inferred, are shown on plate 6. Some of the larger ones have been named. The main faults are readily divided into those that trend within a few degrees of north, and those that trend N. 45°-65° W.
The north-trending group is exposed principally in two areas-the eastern part of the Dugway Range and the eastern side of Spor Mountain. Actual exposures of the north-trending faults are rare, and some are partly inferred from topography.
The east face of the Dugway Range is an escarpment that extends in a fairly straight line for about 6 miles. The Paleozoic rocks. are tilted about 40° W. No large faults are exposed· at the base of the escarpment, but several small faults ·with a north trend have been mapped near Straight Canyon and Trailer Wash. Repetition of outcrops of Prospect Mountain quartzite, Cabin Shale, and Busby quartzite near Trailer Wash indicate the presence of additional north-strik~ ing faults. The major fault in this group is probably located to the east beneath the alluvium, and may be close to Dugway-Topaz Well, ·which produces hot
water. (See p. 5). It is also possible that the Fan-
dangle fault may curve to a more southerly strike and pass close to this well. Other north-trending faults in the eastern Dugway Range are probably present beneath the alluvium in Fandangle Canyon.
Faults with a north trend have been mapped on either side of Eagle Rock Ridge on the east side of Spor Mountain. At least one of the two faults continues southward to Searle Canyon, where it is either
offset or bends southeastward. The best exposure of the easternmost fault is along the east side of Eagle Rock Ridge where volcanic rocks of Tertiary age are faulted against Silurian rocks. A dip of 48° E. was observed at one place on this fault; plunge of striations indicates that the last movement was nearly dip

slip. West of the south end of Eagle Rock Ridge

near the foot of Spor Mountain a dip of 66° E. was

recorded on another north-trending fault.

Unlike the north-trending faults in the Dugway

Range, which closely parallel the strike of the sedi-

mentary rocks, the fault between Eagle Rock Ridge

and Spor Mountain truncates the sedimentary rocks
at angles of as much as 45°. It should also be noted

that this fault is offset by an east-trending fault near

the south end of Eagle Rock Ridge.

The other main group of Basin and Range faults,

the northwest-trending set, includes some of the largest

faults in the Thomas and Dugway Ranges. Most of

the northwest-trending faults are in the northern and

western parts of the Dugway Range. They will be

.discussed in the order in which they appear from

northeast to southwest. .

One of the largest of the faults is the Fandangle.

It is not exposed, but must have a stratigraphic throw

of at least 9,000 feet (section B-B', pl. 2) and prob-

ably has much more, because the Prospect Mountain

quartzite is brought opposite rocks of Silurian age

on the east side of Fandangle Canyon. Johnson and

Cook (1957, p. 59) found a large gravity anomaly

near the southeastward projection of this fault, and

they also reported a large anomaly along the north-

east side of the Dugway Range north of the mapped

area. It thus appears that the Fandangle fault may

extend from the north tip of the range south-eastward

at least 11 miles.

The next important fault of northwest trend follows

Straight Canyon and crosses Dugway Ridge to Fan-

dangle Canyon, and may not properly belong to the

Basin and Range system. It is included here because

it parallels the Fandangle fault and others in this

area. It apparently ends against the Buckhorn thrust

fault in upper Fandangle Canyon, but its actual ter-

mination is obscure. In places it is a high-angle re-

verse fault (section 0-0', pl. 2); a dip of 83° NE.,

was measured at the head of Straight Canyon. In

the bottom of Straight Canyon the Cambrian forma~

tions are offset about 300 feet.

·

Southwest of Fandangle Canyon is the Engelmann

fault, which can be traced for nearly 6 miles from the

head of Green Grass Valley northward for about 1.5

miles, and thence northwestward across Engelmann

Canyon nearly to Buckhorn Canyon, where it dies out.

It dips westward 60 to 80°. Near the south end the

throw is a little more than 1,000 feet (section 0-0',

pl. ·2) ; in that area it results in: the omission of the ·

upper part of the Lamb ·dolomite and most of the

Straight Canyon formation. Farther north the dis-

This fault system, though doubtless complicated by faults of other trends, offsets the Sevy-Engelmann contact nearly a mile.
STRUCTURE OF THE VOLCANIC ROCK
Volcanic rocks, which cover a large area from the south-central Dugway Range to the south end of the . Thomas Range, are relatively unfaulted compared with the underlying older rocks. The younger group of flows of the Thomas Range is generally fiat-lying (section D-D', E-E' pl. 2), although the internal flow structure is highly contorted in many areas. A structure contour map (pl. 5) on the base of one of the flows of the younger group shows that, whereas the general interfiow surface is relatively horizontal, gentle undulations in this surface appear to coincide rather well with present topographic features; the structurally high points on the map probably represent the vent areas. Local sharp irregularities in obsidian layers at the base of flows are generally initial dips of the glass deposited on an eroded surface.
The attitude of the rocks of the older volcanic group, due to their poor exposure, is more difficult to determine, but in some places they hav.e approximately the same strike and dip as the Paleozoic rocks.
Twenty-two faults were p.oted within the volcanic block; of these, 18 trend from north to northwest, one trends east, and three northeast. In addition, volcanic rocks outside the block in the vicinity of Spor Mountain are cut by faults in some places. All the faults dip rather steeply and displacement on most of them is very small, and may reflect renewed movement on older faults in the basement rock.
The Colored Pass fault (pl. 6), the largest within the volcanic block, can be traced northward for nearly 2 miles ·from the vicinity of Colored Pass. It is a steep normal fault dipping east (pl. 4), and, although the displacement is difficult to measure, the throw is several hundred feet. A small·fault of parallel trend is present about 0.7 mile northeast of Colored Pass, and another trending north-northeast cuts porphyritic rhyolite and tuff southwest of Colored Pass (pl. 1).
A fault of northeast trend lies on the southeast side.
of Topaz Mountain where it extends for about a mile from Topaz Valley eastward. It has a vertical displacement of approximately 60 feet at a point just

west of the Autunite No. 8 claim. There are several small faults of northwest trend in the Topaz Mountain area.
Two minor north-trending faults occur in the northcentral part of the Thomas Range. The largest has a throw of about 50 feet. A series of minor northwestand north-trending faults cuts the volcanic rocks in the south-central part of the Dugway Range. The maximum vertical displacement of these is about 100 feet. Their trend is parallel to some of the faults in the underlying Paleozoic rocks.
Three border faults are exposed or inferred on the edges of the volcanic block. Two are Basin and Range faults that form the boundary between the volcanic and the Spor Mountain blocks. The other is an east-trending fault that forms part of the boundary between the volcanic anq the Dugway Ridge blocks. The vertical displacement on this east-trending normal fault is at least several hundred feet near the east edge of the Thomas Range where the volcanic rocks are brought down against the Cambrian sedimentary rocks, but to the west where rhyolite bounds both sides of the fault the amount of displacement cannot be estimated.
Numerous fractures were noted in the volcanic rocks. At the Autunite No. 8 and Buena No. 1 claims northtrending fractures in rhyolite contain uraniferous opal. At several places near the southeast corner of Antelope Ridge and on the north side of the hills about 0.5 mile east of Antelope Ridge, a number of northwest-trending fractures were noted. Rhyolite, normally light gray in color, is locally bleached white or stained orange in the vicinity of these fractures. The scattered outcrops of rhyolite about 4 miles northwest of Dugway Pass are highly fractured and in some places contain tuffaceous pebble dikes and manganiferous calcite veins.
AGE OF FAULTING
The precise age of the faulting in· the Thomas and Dugway Ranges is not known. Gil~uly (1932, p. 8586) found that an early Tertiary age for some of the faulting in the Stockton-Fairfield quadrangles was the most reasonable, but that a later stage, Basin and Range faulting, probably had its principal movement in Miocene or early Pliocene time. Nolan (1935, p. 63-64) recognized several cycles of faulting in the Gold Hill area ; the earliest he believed began in Cretaceous or early Eocene time, the latest he thought began in late Pliocene time. Lovering (1949, p. 13) believed that the faulting in the East Tintic district was probably contemporaneous with that of the Wasatch (Upper Cretaceous and Eocene). He recognized no Basin and Range faulting in in the East Tintic district.

GEOLOGY AND MINERAL DEPOSITS, THOMAS AND DUGWAY RANGES, UTAH

MINERAL DEPOSITS
The mineral deposits in the Thomas and Dugway Ranges may be subdivided into three principal groups: uraniferous fluorspar deposits, uranium deposits, and lead-zinc-copper-silver deposits. Each of these types is found in a separate area characterized by a particular type of country rock, ore control, and mineralogy. The uraniferous fluorspar deposits are in pipes and veins in dolomite throughout Spor Mountain and consist chiefly of fluorspar with minor silica minerals and clay. The uranium deposits are in replacement bodies and veins in rhyolite and tuffaceous sandstone at the ~outh end of the main part of the Thomas Range; they consist of uranium minerals with opal and ~inor fluorite. The lead-zinc-copper-silver deposits are chiefly veins in limestone, dolomite, and ·quartzite in the northern part of the Dugway Range and contain galena, sphalerite, fluorite, barite, quartz, pyrite, chalcopyrite and their alteration products.
The only organized mining district is the Dugway mining district in the northern part of the Dugway Range. The Spor Mountain area is locally called the Thomas Range fluorspar district, and has been referred to as such in several publications (Fitch, Quigley, and Barker, 1949, p. 63; Staatz and Osterwald, 1959). No district name has been proposed for the area in which the uranium deposits are found.
URANIFEROUS FLUORSPAR DEPOSITS
cr,.ASSIFICA.TION OF DEPOSITS
Fluorspar has been found in approximately 50 deposits large enough to warrant some development work. These deposits fall into three types: (1) pipeor chimneylike bodi~, (2) veins, and (3) disseminated deposits. Figure 50 shows the location of properties mentioned in this section.
Pipes.-Pipelike bodies are by far the most important deposits in the district, and 27 out of 31 producing deposits, from which has come more than 99 percent of the total produCtion, are of this type. Pipelike ore bodies are responsible for most of the production at the Lost Sheep, Bell Hill, Blowout, Fluorine Queen, Floride, Lucky Louie, Hilltop, Oversight, Dell No. 1, Dell No. 5, and Green Crystal properties (fig. 50).
The pipelike bodies range from less than a foot in diameter to 155 feet long by 106 feet wide. Ore bodies with their longest horizontal axes more than 100 feet long include the main Lost Sheep pipe, the large pipe on the Bell Hill property, the Blowout pipe, the two large pipes on the Fluorine Queen property, the western pipe on the Dell No. 5 property, and the

Floride pipe. In plan some pipes are oval, such as the Lucky Louie mine, and others are highly irregular, as at the Bell Hill and Blowout properties. In section a few pipes are vertical, but most show an eastward plunge at angles of 52° to 90°. Table 19 gives the angle and direction of plunge of some of· the better rlefined ore bodies. Most pipes show little variation in plunge, but the Bell Hill pipe shows an abrupt sudden change just below the 87-foot level. Above this level the pipe plunges 52 ° NE. and below this level it plunges 70° ESE.

Most of the fluorspar pipes show a consistent tendency to narrow with depth. Some pinch rapidly, as does the Lucky Louie, which has an oval cross section with a length of 35 feet and a ma.ximum width of 14 feet at the surlace, and a length of 10 feet and a maximum width of 7.5 feet at a depth of 120 feet below the surface. The oval pipe on the Harrisite property is 6 feet long by 4 feet maximum width at the surface and is 4 feet long by 2 feet wide at a depth of 22 feet below the surface. Other pipes that diminish in size at depth are the Floride, the east pipe of the Fluorine Queen, the Blowout, the two large pipes on the Bell Hill property, the Lost Sheep, and the Oversight. Although much of this decrease in size is gradational, some ore bodies seem to show an abrupt widening or flaring toward the present ground surface. Some of these ore bodies include the Lost Sheep, the large ore body of the Bell Hill, the Floride, and the east ore body of the Fluorine Queen. The flaring of the Lost Sheep ore body started approximately 50 feet below the present surface.
Some ore bodies also change radically in shape with depth. Some ore bodies split with depth, as does the large ore body on· the Oversight property, which divides into two smaller pipes about 60 feet below the ·surface (H. L. Bauer, Jr.; see footnote, p. 7). The large body on the Bell Hill property is H-shaped on the surface, is lenticular on the 60-foot level, and below the 150-foot level splits into two lenticular ore bodies. The east ore body of the Fluorine Queen on the adit level has a large irregular horse of dolomite not found on the surface.

In some places intrusive breccia bodies may be hidden inasmuch as they show little resistance to weathering. For example, at the Hilltop property a small intrusive breccia body adjacent to the two ore bodies was exposed only after 3 feet of overburden were removed.

spar ore bodies associated with faults include (1) the largest pipe on the Bell Hill property, which is in a fracture zone between two faults, (2) the second largest pipe on the Bell Hill property, which is in the footwall of a fault, (3) another smaller pipe in the same fault zone, (4) the Floride ore body on the hanging-wall side of a fault (fig. 51), (5) both the Harrisi.te pipes, and (6) the Thursday vein. The disseminated ore body in tuff on the Rainbow No. 2 prospect is also within 20 feet of a fault.
Fluorspar pipes and veins are also commonly found in fractured and brecciated dolomite adjacent to intrusive breccia bodies. Fluorspar ore bodies of this type include three pipes on the Dell property, the southern small pipe on the Dell No. 5 property, the two Hilltop pipes, the Blowout pipe, the main Lost Sheep pipe, and the Eagle Rock vein. Some fluorspar is found in intrusive breccia bodies but consists chiefly of veins of no great economic interest. Veins in intrusive breccia occur in the cut to the main Lost Sheep pipe, near the mouth of the adit to the Blowout pipe, and near the mouth of the adit to the northernmost Dell pipe.
Fluorspar deposits also occur in porous zones. For the most part these include the disseminated deposits which are found in vitric tuffs and in the soft altered contact zone between various volcanic rocks and dolomite.
Some fluorspar pipes show no apparent relation to shattering caused by faulting, to intrusive breccia bodies, or to porous zones. The main ore body at the Oversight mine is 65 feet from the closest fault and 150 feet from an intrusive breccia body. The Lucky Louis pioe is also in a faulted area but is approximately 90 feet from the nearest fault. Similarly, both large pipes on the Fluorine Queen property and the Green Crystal pipe are in a faulted area but not ad-

MINERALOGY OF THE ORE
Fluorite.-The fluorspar ore of Spor Mountain contains 65 to 95 percent fluorite. But unlike the coarsely crystalline material of most other fluorspar deposits, this is generally a soft powdery clay-like mass, a hard boxwork, or a dense aphanitic mass, in which not a crystal can be seen.
The color may be blue, white, yellow, purple, brown, or any admixture. Fluorite in the largest ore body on the Bell Hill property is generally white or yellow, although some blue and deep-purple ore is present; in the second largest ore body on the Bell Hill property, it is mainly deep blue or purple. Fluorite from the Hilltop and Oversight properties is generally brown, and in the other pipes may be a mixture of these colors.
In appearance the fluorite resembles that of either a soft pulverulent clay or dense fine-grained silica. Where it is blue or purple, the fluorite is fairly easy to recognize, but where it is white, yellow, or brown, it shows little resemblance to the fluorite from most other parts of the country. Hard crystalline fluorite in which·distinct crystals are recognizable in the hand specimen is rare and was noted only on the Hilltop property, the Dell No. 5 property, and the claim on the northern part of Spor Mountain (fig. 50). This fluorite occurs in colorless or pale-purple cubes, 1 to 2 mm across, scattered through veinlets.
Bloecher (1952, p. 13), while investigating recoverability of uranium from fluorspar ore, noted that when he roasted dark-purple fluorite from the Bell Hill property to more than 400°C it turned pale yellow or white. One explanation of this color change. is that the deep-purple color in the original fluorite is formed by lattice distortion brought on by the radioactive decay of uranium minerals, and when the mineral is heated, the structure expands, the distortion vanishes, and the color changes from purple to white. In order to prove the correctness of this explanation, Bloecher (1952, p. 18) sorted out the purple from the white ore and analyzed the two ores. His results showed, however, that the white fluorite contained a much higher uranium concentration than the

134

GEOLOGY AND MINERAL DEPOSITS, THOMAS AND DUGWAY RANGES, UTAH

purple fluorite-. The color of the fluorite ·from this pipe is of particular interest because this fluorite had the highest uranium content_ of any fluorspar deposit. Although Bloecher did not explain why the white fluorite had the highest uranium content, Przibram (1956, p. 193) in a later article noted that prolonged and intense radiation can lead to bleaching of colored fluorite. He cited the examples of bleaching in fluorite in some radiactive halos and the bleaching of deep-purple fluorite by radium when it was stored in the Blue John mine, Derbyshire, during World War II. A possible explanation of the color change noted may be that dark-blue or purple fluorite is an intermediate stage between pale-blue and white fluorite. The conditions needed to form white fluorite probably depend not only on the uranium content, but on the proximity of the uranium-bearing mineral to the particular fluorite grain, the grain size of the fluorite, and th~ length of time since the deposit was formed.·
Uranium minerals.-Although all the fluorspar deposits show abnormal radioactivity' vi~ible uranium minerals are quite rare. Fine-gr.ained powdery yellow uranium miner:;tls were found sparsely in six deposits: the Eagle Rock vein; a small ore body 100 feet west of the Eagle Rock vein, the large pipe on the Bell Hill .property, a small vein on the contact between rhyodacite and dolomite on the Harrisite property, the Floride pipe, and the west pipe on the Fluorine Queen property. Uranium minerals are rare except on the Eagle Rock property. At only two of these deposits-the vein at the Eagle Rock property and the west pipe of the Fluorine Queen-did the megascopic uranium mineral occur in the fluorspar; in the others it was found on the dolomite or rhyodacite adjacent _to the fluorspar ore body. In hand specimen the yellow uranium minerals from the various deposits appear quite similar. X-ray examination of the yellow uranium minerals from the Eagle Rock and Bell Hill properties showed them to be carnotite, but the powder pattern of the yellow uranium mineral from the Harrisite property did not match that of any known mineral. A spectrographic analysis showed that uranium and silicon were the two major constituents.
Uranium occurs in some areas, such as the James. town district, Colorado (Goddard, 1946, p. 19), as pitchblende scattered through the fluorspar ore. Several samples from the large ·pipe on the Bell Hill
property, which has the highest uranium content, were put in heavy liquids, but no heavy minerals were ob-
tained. Pitchblende may occur, however, in small
amounts in some deposits, but it does not appear to be an important uranium mineral in this district.

Autoradiographs were made of several specimens of ore containing more than 0.10 percent uranium in an attempt to determine distribution of the uraniumbearing mineral. The autoradiographs showed no concentration of uranium· but a more or less uniform haze over the entire autoradiograph. F. _W. Bloecher (1952, p. 5) sieved the ore and noted that the uranium from the Bell Hill property was more or less equally divided between the various size fractions. The preceding data indicates that the uranium may be present as either U+ 4 in the fluorite lattice or as a distinct 1.uanium mineral with clay-size dimensions.
Sulfides and owides.-No metallic sulfides or oxides are visible in any of the fluorspar deposits nor were any recovered in heavy mineral separations of the ore from a number of pipes. Trace amounts of pyrite, hematite, magnetite, and chalcopyrite have been reported elsewhere-(Bloecher, 1952, p. 5) in a heavymineral separate made on ore from the lower part of the opencut on the largest pipe of the Bell Hill property.
Gangue minerals.-Gangue minerals found in the various fluorspar ore bodies are montmorillonite, quartz, dolomite, calcite, and chalcedony. Montmorillonite is the most common gangue mineral and occurs as a white waxy clay mineral resembling mutton tallow. On drying by exposure to air, it becomes a white powdery substance that is not readily distinguishable megascopically from white fluorite. Six samples of this clay were collected from the lowest adit on the Blowout pipe, from a stope on the 87-foot level of the Bell Hill mine, and from surface workings of the largest pipe on the Harrisite property. X-ray and petrological study of these samples by E. W. Tooker showed that all samples are calcium-magnesium montmorillonite. · l\1ontmorillonite is most prevalent in the deeper parts of a deposit and commonly occurs in rounded balls or masses. In the lower underground workings of the Blowout pipe, these masses of clay are as. large as 1 foot across.
Chalcedony ranks next in abundance to montmorillonite as a gangue mineral and is found in the Lucky Louie pipe, the main Lost Sheep ore body, the east ore body of the Fluorine Queen, the largest ore body on the Bell Hill property, and a number of small prospects. The chalcedony is a dark-gray dense aphanitic mineral that resembles some of the chert found in the dolomite.
Quartz occurs in small clear crystals which coat a boxwork type of ore in the Oversight and Blowout mines and is also found in the lower part of the Bell Hill and Lost Sheep mines, where it commonly coats
chalcedony.

large pipe on the Oversight property, which from the surface to a depth of approximately 80 feet consists of a brown boxwork of fluorite; however, on the adit level, 150 feet below the surface, the ore body consists of fractured dolomite surrounded by a boxwork of brown fluorite veinlets. Also changing with depth is the large ore body on the Bell Hill property, which from the surface to the 129-foot level consists of pulverulent fluorite, on the 150-foot level contains an 8-foot band of vuggy quartz and light-colored dolomit~ in the east end of the ore body, and on the lower levels contains even more abundant impurities.
Most ore bodies have shown a change of mineralogy with depth, and those that have been mined to depths greater than 80 feet show that the upper part of the ore body contains chiefly fluorite and that the lower part contains various other minerals in addition to fluorite. Although the overall tenor of the ore body may decrease considerably with depth, many of these impurities occur on one side or part of the ore body. The fluorspar mined in areas between masses of chalcedony, montmorillonite, or quartz com-
.monly contains as much as OaF2 as the ore in the upper parts of the deposit.

Watson (1953, written communication) of Chief Consolidated Mining Co. stated that, although assay values for every shipment were not returned, a composite assay of those provide~ showed that ore from the Lucky ·Louie in 1952 averaged 81.6 percent OaF2 and 5.2 percent Si02. Seventy samples from the deposits on Spor Mountain were analyzed by the U.S. Geological Survey for fluorine. From these results, the fluorine content is calculated and presented in table 20. The results range from 2.9 percent OaF2 in a small disseminated· ore body to 94.3 percent for high grade ore in the winze of the Bell Hill mine. Excepting samples from the drill hole in the Bell Hill mine, where the ore commonly was mixed with country rock, the lowest grade sample from a producing deposit contained 49.5 percent CaF2 in the Floride deposit. The analyses show considerable variation in grade in the same deposit from opposite sides of the ore body. This variation is due mainly to increase or decrease of the Si02 content, which is the main impurity. · The Si02 content of some mines, such as the Blowout, Lost Sheep, and Fluorine Queen, comes mainly from montmorillonite, because quartz and chalcedony are but minor constituents of the ore.
Uranium oontent.-The uranium content of 181.

CHEMICAL COMPOSITION OF THE ORE

samples taken from the veins, pipes, and disseminated

The fine-grain size of the ore and the lack of distinctive characte.r of most of the minerals ·make it extremely difficult to estimate by visual inspection the tenor of the ore. ·Thus, the variation in both the fluorite and uranium contents of the ore is best de-

deposits ranged from 0.003 to 0.33 percent uranium (table 20). A sample containing 0.59 percent uranium was obtained from the Eagle Rock property, but represents selected pieces of the highest grade material and is not representative of any large part

termined from chemical analyses.

s A carload of ore generally weighs between 50 and 55 tons.

of the ore body. Only four properties had deposits from which samples containing more than 0.10 percent uranium were obtained. The largest of these deposits is the large ore body on the Bell Hill property from which four near-surface samples contained over 0.20 percent uranium. The ore bodies on the other three properties are small. These include (1) a vein of dark-purple fluorspar several inches thick and about 6 feet long in a prospect 3,200 feet northeast of the Lucky Louie mine, (2) a similar-appearing vein with a maximum width of 4 feet, a length of at least 40 feet, in a pit exposing altered dolomite coated with carnotite on the Eagle Rock claim, and (3) two small pipes and several veins containing white fluorspar on the Harrisite claim. ·
The uranium content was determined for most samples both by chemical analysis and by measuring its radioactivity (equivalent uranium). The uranium content is equal to the equivalent uranium content if all the radiation has come from the daughter products formed by decay of uranium, and if these daughter products are in equilibrium with uranium. The results of the analyses (table 20) show some variation in some samples, but the small difference in most
samples suggests that the equivalent uranium con-

tent is a fair measurement of the total uranium content.
The uranium content of an individual deposit varies from place to place even on the same level (table 20). For example, in the Bell Hill mine, 7 samples from the 87-foot level ranged from 0.049 to 0.15 percent uranium and 6 samples from the 108-foot level ranged from 0.029 to 0.12 percent uranium.
A distinct decrease in uranium content also occurs in a number of deposits between the surface and underground workings. An excellent example of this is also furnished by the large ore body on the Bell Hill property.' Samples from the opencut contained 0.32, 0.26, 0.093, 0.25, 0.33, 0.17, and 0.18 percent uranium and samples from the 69-foot level contained 0.17, 0.094, 0.15, 0.049, 0.15~ and 0.069 percent uranium. Another example is the east pipe of the Fluorine Queen, where samples from the opencut contained 0.020, 0.019, and 0.023 percent uranium and those from the adit contained 0.010, 0.006, and 0.008 percent uranium. A similar trend but on fewer samples is seen at the Oversight, where a surface sample contained 0.006 percent uranium and one from the adit
150 feet below contained 0.003 percent uranium, and
at the south ore body on the Lost Sheep property

MINERAL DEPOSITS

which had 0.014 percent uranium at the surface and 0.009 percent uranium in the adit 45 feet below. The main ore body on the Lost Sheep property showed no apparent decrease in uranium content from the opencut to a depth of 150 feet.
At first it was believed that the change in uranium content was due to zoning with a gradual decrease in uranium content with depth. Inasmuch as some of the ore deposits are exposed only at the surface and others are accessible only at two levels (the surface and one underground working), this theory appeared feasible. Table 20 and graphs of individual samples plotted against depth also seem to substantiate this view. When the Bell Hill mine was deepened, it was possible to obtain numerous samples from a number of elevations. A series of_ samples were taken on eight underground levels and from a drill hole that cut the ore body (table 20). The analyses from all levels below and including the 69-foot level showed no greater deviation than was found between individual samples from the same level. A sharp increase in grade occurred, however, between this group of analyses and those taken above in the opencut. A similar abrupt increase in grade came at approximately the same depth from the surface in the east ore body on the Fluorine Queen property. The higl1er grade samples came from between 5 and 20 feet below the surface, and the lower grade ones from the adit 53 feet below the surface. The change in grade can also be shown to occur close to the surface in the south ore body on the Lost Sheep property, where the lower grade sample came from 42 feet below the surface. · The CaF2 content of the deposits shows no apparent relation to the uranium content and may either increase or decrease with an increase of uranium. Thus, the increase of the uranium grade at the top appears related to the present topographic surface rather than to gradual zoning.
Inasmuch as the deposits all occur well above the present ground-water table, the increase in uranium content near the surface probably was caused by slow leaching of the uppermost part of the ore body, in part from material being actively eroded. The uranium is carried downward and redeposited as the water is adsorbed by the dry powdety ore below, at some level between a few inches and approximately 30 feet below the surface. The leaching of the fluor-
spar deposits is slow because of the small annual precipitation. Although no record of the amount of
precipitation has been kept in this area, the annual precipitation is probably bet,veen 5 and 8 inches (table 1). ~{ost of the precipitation in the Thomas Range falls as snow duri1i.g the winter months. The
n2-1oo 0--64-to

slow-melting snow saturates the upper few inches to few feet of the ore body and leaches the uranium out of the fluorite. ·The downward-migrating ground water is quickly adsorbed by the dry underlying ore, and the uranium is precipitated as carnotite or some other secondary mineral. After the snow disappears, the rest of the ore quickly dries out. This type of enrichment will only take place in a dry arid climate where the water table is deep. The depth of the ~ater table is unknown on Spor Mountain, but in tunnels on the Dell and Blowout properties, which pass 220 and 240 feet below the surface exposure of the ore bodies, the water table has not been reached.
ORIGIN OF THE URANIFEROUS FLUORSPAR DEPOSiTS
Jillagrnatic source.-The· eastern part of the Thomas Range consists entirely of volcanic rocks and a lightgray rhyolite that makes up more than 95 percent of the total. The rhyolite is noted for the presence of the fluorine-bearing mineral topaz, which occurs as small euhedral crystals in lithophysae and as larger crystals in vugs. Smaller light-gray rhyolite bodies are found in and adjacent to Spor ~{ountain as dikes, plugs, and flows. Although little topaz is visible in the hand specimen in this rhyolite, small euhedral grains can be seen in thin section to make up part of the groundmass. The topaz in the groundmass appears to have formed early during the crystallization of the rhyolite, but the well-formed topaz crystals in the vugs appear to have formed after most of the rhyolite solidified. This sequence of formation suggests that the rhyolite magma contained an excess of fluorine, some of which combined during the crystallization ·of the rhyolite to form small topaz crystals in the groundmass and some of which formed the larger topaz in the lithophysae and vugs.
The fact that topaz is also foi1nd in some of the rhyolitic tuffs but is. not found in rhyodacite suggests that the fluorine was concentrated in the more silicic later part of the volcanic sequence. Thus, it is probable that the fluorine was progressively concentrated during the differentiation of the volcanic magma and that an excess of fluorine was left in a hydrothermal fluid after the consolidation of at least most of the
rhyolite. These fluids are believed to be the source of the fluorine that formed the fluorspar deposits on
Spor Mountain. The uranium ·in the uraniferous fluorspar deposits
may also have come from the rhyolitic magma, inasmuch as rocks of the younger volcanic group, which make up the greater part of the volcanic rocks, con-. tain roughly three times the uranium content of the average rhyolitic rock in Western United States. (See

fluorspar deposits occurred, however, before Lake Bonneville time, for boulders of fluorspar were found in the Lake Bonneville gravels on the Lucky Louie property. The above data indicates the fluorspar deposition most likely took place some time during the Pliocene.

Bauer (see footnote, p. 7) also described fluorite veinlets in a volcanic breccia. Although most of the fluorspar formed later than both the older and younger groups of volcanic rocks, at one place the volcanics appear to be younger. This place is in the underground workings of the Bell Hill mine, where an intrusive rhyolite tuff or rhyolitic pebble dike cuts the main fluorspar ore body. Thus, the fluorspar deposits formed after the bulk of the volcanic activity, but before the last eruptions.
Because the age of all the vulcanism is not known, the age of the fluorspar deposition can only be approximated. The only volcanic rock dated was a crystal tuff from the older volcanic group, which is middle Miocene in age. The older group was tilted and eroded before the younger volcanic group was deposited, and near the very end of this period of volcanic activity the fluorspar deposits were formed. Hence, a considerable period of time could have elapsed between the deposition of the tuff in probable Miocene time and the fluorspar deposits. The deposition of the

SUGGESTIONS FOR PROSPECTING
Uraniferous fluorspar deposits have been found from the north to the south end of Spor Mountain and on the adjacent Eagle Rock Ridge (fig. 50). Most of the deposits occur, however, in the central and eastern parts of Spor Mountain; little fluorspar has been found in the western part. The lack of known deposits on the west side of Spor Mountain may be due to a lack of sufficient prospecting, but it may also be due to this area's being less favorable.
The area within Spor Mountain can be somewhat limited because no fluorspar deposits have been found in the quartzite of the Swan Peak :formation or the sedimentary rocks below and no ore has been produced from sedimentary rocks above the Thursday dolomite. Thus, the favorable sedimentary rocks are the four Silurian dolomites (Thursday, Lost Sheep, Harrisite, and Bell Hill), the Ordovician or Silurian Floride dolomite, and the Ordovici~n Fish Haven dolomite.
Within these sedimentary rocks, most of the ore bodies are adjacent to either faults or intrusive breccia bodies. Inasmuch as Spor Mountain is cut by approximately 1,000 :faults the job of prospecting along all of them is enormous. Prospecting is most likely to be fruitful, however, in the vicinity of known fluorite veins or pipes, because commonly the ore deposits occur in groups. Prospecting around intrusive breccia pipes is somewhat easier for they are considerably less in number.
The fluorspar deposits are soft and easily eroded and form topographic lows generally covered by dolomite slope wash. In areas where the dolomite occurs as prominent outcrops, oval or circular covered areas surrounded by dolomite are favorable sites for finding either concealed fluorspar pipes or concealed volcanic plugs. Float has been an invaluable aid in the early prospecting. Unfortunately the weathered, detrital fluorspar is very soft and is rarely found far from . the deposits. Commonly it is included in the debris surrounding ant hills and badger and other animal burrows above the deposits. In areas where the dolomite is chiefly a slope-maker or where the bed rock is covered in part by Lake Bonneville sediments, the ore deposits are difficult to find. One such deposit, the large ore body of the -Dell No. 5, was found 6 feet

below the surface, during construction of a road to another deposit.
The ore bodies are all abnormally radioactive, so a scintillation counter or a Geiger counter is helpful in exploring for fluorspar bodies if the overburden is not too thick. This method was used by the Chief Consolidated Mining Co., which found the Lucky Louie, during its prospecting (Fitch, Quigley, and Barker, 1949, p. 66).
If the prospector is interested chiefly in the uranium rather than the fluorite content of the deposits, then the area to prospect is somewhat more limited. Although all the fluorspar deposits showed some abnormal radioactivity, only at the Eagle Rock prospect on the Eagle Rock Ridge and on three properties in the southernmost part of Spor Mountain did any of the ore contain more than 0.10 percent uranium. Detailed maps of these two areas at 1: 6,000 have been published (Staatz and Osterwald, 1959, pls. 3, 4). The .area on the south end of Spor Mountain appears to be the most favorable area, but much of it is mantled or partly mantled with Lake Bonneville sediments. Here, the ore deposits are generally related to faulting. Prospecting should be carried on in the less covered parts with the aid of a scintillation counter. Covered areas, along faults, especially in the area where other fluorite mineralization is present, should be trenched.
HISTORY AND. PRODUCTION
Commercial use of fluorite has grown rapidly in the last thirty years. The prospector of the early twentieth century was not interested in Utah fluorspar because of its low value and remoteness from markets in the East, and hence little early prospecting was done for this ore. Although a little fluorspar was produced in Utah prior to 1944, the increasing demand and prices stimulated by World War II caused production to increase sharply in that year (Thurston, Staatz, Cox, and others, 1954, p. 3). Since 1948 most of Utah's. fluorspar production has come from the Spor Mountain area.
The first fluorspar deposit located in the district was the Floride, which was found in 1936 by Chad and Ray Spor in prospecting northward from the Drum mining district (Fitch, Quigley, and Barker, 1949, p. 65). No production occurred until1944, however; when the Spor brothers shipped their first carload of ore to Geneva Steel Co. at Geneva, Utah. In the 5 years, 1944 through 1948, 8,748 tons of fluorspar was produced (table 21). In 1949 the mine was idle; in 1950, 463 tons of ore was produced and from that time through 1956 the mine was idle. All the ore

above the lower levef (70 feet below the surface) was removed; ore occurs in this mine below that level.
The second major discovery was on the Dell property, which was located in May 1947 by Earl Willden, T. A. Claridge, and Lafe Morley, all of Delta, Utah. They sold this property to Ward Leasing Co. of Salt Lake City, which mined three ore bodies. The inain ore body was intersected just above its contact with the quartzite of the Swan Peak formation about 200 feet below the surface. By 1950 the main ore body as well as one of the others had been mined from the surface to the quartzite, with the production o£ 5,100 short tons of ore. The only mining on this property from 1950 through 1956 was in 1953 or 1954 when lessees removed some of the pillars in the main pipe (table 21).
In 1948 a number of claims containing large pipes were located. The first of these was the Fluorine Queen, located by W. E. Black and F. B. Chesley of Delta, Utah, in March 1948. Two large pipes were discovered on this claim which lies astride a 6,200foot saddle in the central part of Spor Mountain. Production started in 1948 (table 21) from the western pipe. Mining was shifted to the eastern pipe in 1950, where it continued until the fall of 1953 when the mine was shut down. Mining was resumed in the fall of 1955 and was shifted back to the western pit in 1956. This property has been one of the larger· producers in the district and had produced through 1956 a total of 24,087 short tons (table 21).
The next large discovery was made by Albert and Earl Willden on May 10, 1948, in the northern part of Spor Mountain. The claim located on this pipe was called the Lost Sheep because the Willdens were chasing stray sheep when they noted ·fluorspar ore in a mound from a badger hole (H. L. Bauer, Jr.; see footnote, p. 7). The overburden was.cleared off, and production was started by open-pit methods. The opencut in the fall of 1956 had vertical walls approximately 125 feet high. The Lost Sheep has produced more fluorspar than any other property in the district and has operated almost continuously since its dis-
covery to 1956. The Blowout claim was located on a pipe adjacent
to the Lost Sheep claim by Tass and Rex Claridge on May 19, 1948. The pipe is on the divide at the crest of Spor Mountain. The first ore was shipped from an
opencut on the pipe. Mining ceased in the opencut in the fall of 1950 when large blocks of dolomite as much as 20 feet across caved into the pit. An adit
begun in 1950 on the east side of the mountain cuts the ore body 240 feet below the surface. Mining has been carried out by a series of stopes above the adit

level, but the ore contains considerable clay and is lower grade than that exposed in the opencut.
During 1948 smaller pipes and veins were also found on the Oversight, Lucky Louie, Thursday, Eagle Rock, Nonella, Fluorine Queen No.4, Hilltop, and Dell No.5 claims.
In 1949 interest shifted to the southern end of Spor Mountain where many claims were located, including the Bell Hi.ll and Harrisite. The Bell Hill is the only property on the south end of Spor Mountain that has produced more than 2,000 tons of ore. It was located by C. D., D. W., and H. E. Searle and H. J. Ruthiford on July 7, 1949. Several ore bodies occur on this property, but most of the ore has come from the largest pipe, which was mined from an opencut to a maximum depth of 35 feet in 1950. A 233-foot adit driven from the base of the hill'on which the ore body occurs cuts the pipe 87 feet below the surface. An . inclined winze from the end of this adit was sunk in the ore, and the fluorspar was mined from stopes on four levels below the adit. Later, another more permanent winze was sunk from the adit level in the dolomite. In the spring of. 1956 there were a total of six levels below the adit, the deepest being 237 feet below the surface. In the summer of 1956 part of the side of the opencut caved in and the rock broke through the pillars between the levels and made the mine inaccessible. Five smaller ore bodies have bee~ found on this property. Total production of this property through 1956 was 23,644 short tons (table 21), of which more than 90 percent came from the m~in ore body.
Many additional ore bodies have been found on claims where other ore bodies occur. Several smaller ones have been found since the original discovery on the Lost Sheep and Fluorine Queen properties. Some

of the more recent discov~ries such as the Floride No. 5 pipe and the large pipe on the Dell No. 5 occur on claims that have been located on much smaller fluorspar occurrences. Although hundreds of claims had been located on Spor Mountain through 1956, only two claims, the Lucky Louie and the adjoining Enid, had been patented. These claims were owned in 1956 by Chief Consolidated ~ining Co. of Eureka, Utah.
Prior to 1949 all the fluorspar was shipped to Geneva Steel Co., but since 1949 most of the fluorspar has been bought by Continental Ore Buying Co., although some has gone to Colorado Fuel and Iron Corp. and to the Sheffield Steel Co.
Since 1953 production of fluorspar from Spor Mountain has declined chiefly because of competition from ore imported from Mexico and because of the discovery of large high-grade fluorspar deposits on Crystal Mountain near Darby in Ravalli County, Mont.
Total production of the Thomas Range fluorspar district is 111,700 short tons of 'fluorspar, most of which contained more than 70 percent CaF2• Although ore has been shipped from i4 different properties, 78 percent of the production has come from three properties: the Lost Sheep, Fluorine Queen, and Bell' Hill. The next four properties, the Floride, Blowout, Dell, and Lucky Louie, shipped another 21 percent of the total, and the other seven 2 percent. All available production data are given in table 21 on a yearly basis.

others, 1954, p. 24-45). During the next two years, the district was studied in detail and many of the properties were described more fully by Staatz and Osterwald (1959, p. 62-91). Mining continued from 1952 through 1956, but few new data are available on the geology of most of the ore deposits. During this period fluorspar bodies were. found on the Dell No. 5, Green Crystal, Floride No. 5, and Evening Star claims, and the mines working were enlarged on the Eagle Rock claim. These properties are discussed below. The geology of the Dell, Floride, Nonella, and Thursday properties is described in the report by Thurston, Staatz, Cox, and others (1954), the geology of the Bell Hill, Blowout, Blue Queen No. 1, Fluorine Queen, Fluorine Queen No. 4, Harrisite, Hilltop No. 1, Lost Sheep, Lost Soul No. 1, Lucky Louie, and Oversight properties, in the report by Staatz and Osterwald (1959).
DELL NO. ·FIYE
The Dell No. 5 property, in the central part of Spor Mountain (fig. 50) astride a pass at an elevation of 6,100 feet, was located on April 6, 1948, by Albert and Earl Willden, T. A. Claridge, and Lafe Morley of Delta, Utah. The ·workings are· reached from the main haulage road along the east side of Spor Mountain by a steep private road a little over 1 mile in length.
Two small fluorspar pipes are exposed on the claim, one near the low point of the saddle and the other about 250 feet to the north and 140 feet higher up the ridge. The Spor brothers leased this property in 1948 and drove an adit 48 feet west-northwest to the lower ore body; later they extended the adit for 272 feet toward the upper ore body, which it did not meet. The lower ore body was intersected at about 25 feet below the surface and was stoped for 15 feet above and 27 feet below the adit level. The Spor brothers produced 205 tons of fluorspar from this stope. The upper ore body is partly exposed by bulldozer workings and is prospected by a 15-foot adit. No production has come from this ore body. The property was inactive except for assessment work until 1954 when AI and Earl Willden, in bulldozing a road to the Green Crystal claim, uncovered a large pipe on the west end of this property under 6 to 15 feet of overburden. The ore body was mined from an opencut that by the end of 1956 was 140 feet in length, 120 feet in maximum width, and 35 feet deep on the uphill side (fig. 53). The production of this pipe is not known, but it is estimated to be more than 1,000 tons of fluorspar.
Geology and ore deposits.-The two small fluorspar ore bodies occur on the crest of the range in the Fish

-Haven dolomite adjacent to a porphyritic rhyolite plug. The southernmost of these two pipes was about 15 feet in diameter and contained friable white to purple fluorspar. The north pipe had a minimum diameter of 15 to 20 feet, and although the fluorspar was in part powdery, it contained many hard ribs of siliceous material. These two pipes were described by Staatz (Thurston, Staatz, Cox, and others, 1954, p. 33).
The large ore body O:Q the west end of the property also is in Fish Haven dolomite, but the surface exposure is only a short distance above the Swan Peak formation-Fish Haven dolomite contact, and is 90 feet west of a fault offsetting this contact (fig. 53). The ore body is roughly oval in plan, and although it is not completely exposed, the maximum dimensions in the pit are 150 feet long by 140 feet wide. The ore body has near ~ertical walls and probably extends to the quartzite of the Swan Peak formation. Whether the ·ore extends ·down along ·the contact in the dolomite is not known, but it is likely to end at the quartzite, inasmuch as only small veins of fluorspar have been found extending into the quartzite below pipes in other parts of Spor Mountain. The ore body thus probably ends between 25 and 130 feet below the surface (fig. 53).
Most of the ore from the large western pipe is a light reddish-brown, very fine grained friable boxwork. Some of the ore is dark purple that grades into white, and some is hard and compact. The hard compact ore generally occurs as lumps in the more friable ore, but along the western side of the pipe it . makes up large areas. White calcium-magnesium montmorillonite is found in scattered pockets throughout the fluorspar. Three samples of ore contained from 62.5 to 92.8 percent CaF2 (table 20). The highest grade ore came from the more compact material along the west side of the pipe.
The uranium content of five samples from the west pipe ranged from 0.010 to 0.030 percent uranium; that of one sample from the small north pipe was 0.020 percent uranium; and that of one sample from the south pipe was 0.012 percent uranium (table 20).
EAGLE ROCK
The Eagle Rock property is in a small hollow on the east side near the north end of Eagle Rock Ridge (fig.. 50). The center of this hollow is at an altitude of approximately 5,820 feet, 120 feet above the base of Eagle Rock Ridge. In the flats just east of Eagle Rock Ridge a dirt road parallels the ridge. From this road a short mine road that ends 200 feet laterally and 100 feet lower has been constructed to the main workings. A second, very steep mine road in poor

condition reaches the workings from the north end of the ridge.
The property was located by T. A. and Rex Claridge and AI and Earl Willden, all of Delta, Utah, on August 15, 1948. The discovery trench was dug on a small fluorspar vein (pl. 7). A second trench was dug entirely in .dolomite 13 feet northeast of" this trench, and to the west two bulldozer trenches and an opencut were made to explore a covered area, which is underlain by highly altered dolomite. The newest
workings consist of an adit started at an elevation of approximately 5,710 feet on the side of the ridge· and

driven S. 83° W. toward the discovery trench. In April 1957 it was 169 feet long and had just reached the altered dolomite. No ore has been shipped from this property.
Geology.-The Bell Hill, Harrisite, and Lost Sheep dolomites cro"p out on the Eagle Rock property (pl. 7). These dolomites strike approximately N. 45° E. and dip 30° NW. In the central part of the property a gentle sloping depression is covered by slope wash; similar smaller depressions are found elsewhere on the property. The dolomite near the edges of these depressions is commonly brecciated and the fractures

Ore deposits.-Most of the fluorspar exposed on this property is in a small vein on the southeast corner of the large depression. The vein is vertical, and can be traced for 40 feet. This vein is best exposed in the discovery trench and is extremely irregular in size
and shape. The fluorspar vein thins from-4 to Y2 foot
thick in 10 feet along its strike; near the middle of the trench it also thickens from less than an inch to 4 feet thick in 4 feet of depth.
Small masses of fluorspar with a maximum diameter of 1 foot are exposed in a siliceous boxwork at. the end of the adit at the contact of the dolomite with red calcareous clay.
The fluorspar vein is a dark-purple siliceous boxwork and is unusually hard and resistant in contrast to the powdery' fluorspar common in the district. Quartz can be seen in most specimens and makes up at least 50 percent of the vein. The fluorspar content of the vein is low. The one sample analyzed for fluorine was a 1.7-foot channel sample cut across the vein approximately 7 feet below the surface. · The fluorite content of this sample is 35 percent. Small white botryoidal masses of ca1cite, 1 to 2 mm ~cross, are found plastered on the siliceous fluorspar boxwork in a few places.
Bright-yellow powdery carnotite coats the fluorspar in some places. More carnotite is visible in this vein than in any other fluorspar _deposit in the dh:;trict. Three channel samples cut across this vein contained from 0.088 to 0.17 percent uranium. Two samples from the ore pile mined from this vein contained 0.18 and 0.31 percent uranium. The last sample, however, was of selected high-grade rock. Uranium minerals are also exposed in the pit 100 feet west of the fluor-
spar vein at the west end of one of the bulldozer
trenches. This pit is on the south edge of the de-

The Evening Star property covers a low hill in the southwestern part of Spor Mountain (fig. 50). The workings lie on the northwest side of the hill which is 2,300 feet S. 63° W. of the Floride No. 5 pipe, in the NWl!.t, sec. 10, T. 13 S., R. 12 W. The property is connected to the road around the south end of Spor Mountain by a dirt road about a mile long.
The Evening Star claim was located November 6, 1953, by Glen Bunker and Sydney Searle. The workings consist of a bu1ldozer trench approximately 80 feet long and about 6 feet deep near its center. In the center of the trench an inclined shaft about 8 feet deep has been sunk. Production, if any, from this property appears to have been small.
Geology and ore deposits.-A porphyritic rhyolite intrusion makes up the central part of the low hill and is surrounded by dolomite. The rhyolite contains about 20 percent phenocrysts (0.5 to 1 mm across) of clear sanidine and smoky _quartz in a purplish-gray aphanitic groundmass. Commonly the rhyolite weathers dark brown. Rubble from the rhyolite and Lake Bonneville gravels obscures the contact between the rhyolite and the dolomite. The only exposure is in the bulldozer trench, where the rhyolite is in contact with the lower part of the Lost Sheep dolomite. Along this contact is a zone about 15 feet wide of light-gray clayey material, formed by reaction between the rhyolite and the dolomite. Slickensides indicate some shearing or faulting with a trend of N. 26° E. and a dip of 60° SW.
Fluorspar is spottily distributed in the contact zone in irregular masses surrounded by clayey material. Several small veins also occur in this zone; the largest noted was 8 inches wide. The fluorspar is exposed along ·this zone for a distance of 72 feet; it is fine grained, massive, and dark purple. A grab sample of the dark-purple fluorspar off_ the dump contained 0.023 percent uranium (table 20) .

The ore body is near the crest of a ridge at an altitude of approximately 5,470 feet. The ore bin is connected by a road, 1.7 miles long, to the road that passes around the south end of Spor Mountain.
The Floride No. 5 was located by George, Ray, and Chad Spor on April 27, 1944. The first ore, however, was not shipped until the fall of 1954; this came from an opencut. Owing to the difficulty of building a road to the ore body,· an adit 205 feet long was driven toward the ore body "from an altitude of about 5,340 feet (fig. 54). From its end a raise was extended to the S"\lrface at an altitude of 5,440 feet. A 50-foot trench '(fig. 54) was cut from the top of the raise to the opencut, and the ore above this level was. trammed to the raise and dropped down it. After the ore was mined to the level of the top of the raise, a. second inclined raise was constructed off the first raise to the ore body, which was reached approximately 50 feet below the bottom of the open-

cut. The adit was extended late in 1956 toward the ore body, but by the end of the year had not reached it.

GREEN CRYSTA~
The Green Crystal property is in the central part of Spor Mountain on the west side of the main di_vide (fig. 50), and adjoins the Dell No. 5 property to the northeast. The Green Crystal workings lie on the northwest side of a prominent southwest-trending canyon at ·an altitude of approximately 5,900 feet. The workings are reached from the main haulage road along the east side of Spor Mountain by a steep private road about 11,4 miles long.
The Green Crystal claim was located on October 1, 1952, by Al and Earl Willden and T. A 7 Claridge of Delta, Utah. In 1954 the road to the Dell No. 5 was extended to the Green Crystal. The first ore was produced in late 1955 or early 1956 when, according to Al Willden, 8 carloads, or about 500 tons of fluorspar, were shipped. Workings as of the fall of 1956 consist of an opencut approximately 20 feet wide, 40 feet long, and of a maximum depth of 35 feet.
Geology and ore deposits.-The Green Crystal pipe crops out mainly in the lower part of the Floride dolomite, although a few feet of the pipe on the south side is in the underlying Fish Haven dolomite. This ore body does not appear to be within 150 feet of any fault.
The pipe is oval in plan and is 43 feet long by about 18 feet wide. It appears to plunge steeply in an east-southeast direction.
The ore is generally pale to dark purple, although in places it is light reddish brown. . The fluorspar is very fine grained and occurs mainly as a boxwork, although in some places i~ is found in solid masses. Brown clay is the chief impurity; some chalcedony and white clay were also noted. A 9.5-foot channel sample taken in the upper part of the ore body along its nqrthwest side contained 92.5 percent CaF2 (table 20). This sample also contained 0.020 percent uranium and a sample taken 15 feet lower in the pipe contained 0.038 percent uranium.
URANIUM DEPOSITS
Deposits important chiefly for uranium are found in a poorly defined area in the southern third of the main part of the Thomas Range. These deposits are of two types : veins and disseminated deposits.

VEINS
Vein deposits are found in several places in the southern part of the Thomas Range. These deposits are of little economic interest and no ore had been shipped from any of them through 1956. A small amount of development work has been done on several deposits including the Buena No. 1 (fig. 50) and the Autunite No. 8 (pl. 1). The deposits consist of a number of small veins from one-thirty-second to onehalf an inch thick that fill steeply dipping irregular fractures. These veins may be from less than half an inch to more than 1 foot apart. The areas in which the veins occur are generally not large; the largest known is on the Autunite No. 8 property; it is about 100 feet long and has a maximum width of 25 feet. Some areas are only 10 feet long and a few feet wide; in a few places only a single veinlet is present.
Veins are most common in the porphyritic rhyolite of the older volcanic group, but they are also found in ·rhyolite and vitric tuff of the younger volcanic group.
The relation of the uranium-bearing veins to structural features is not as clear as is that of the uraniferous fluorspar deposits. Four groups of fractures contain veins with abnormally high radioactivity on the Autunite No. 8 property. These lie from 100 to 800 feet south of one of the few faults cutting the volcanic rocks. The fault has a northeast trend and most of the fractures have a northerly trend; these trends suggest the possibility that the fractures were formed by tension set up by shearing movement along the fault.
DISSEMINATED DEPOSITS
Disseminated uranium deposits are known only on the Good Will property in the central part of The Dell (fig~ 50). The only uranium production through 1956 came from these deposits.
Uranium in the disseminated deposits occurs in limestone pebbles or cobbles in a limestone conglomerate and in a tuffaceous sandstone that underlies the conglomerate. Inasm11ch as the limestone cobbles make up only a small part of the conglomerate and only a few of the· cobbles contain any uranium minerals, the conglomerate is of little economic interest. Uranium deposits in the tuffaceous sandstones, however, are of considerable potential economic interest.
The exact size an'd shape of the uranium deposits in the tuffaceous sandstone are difficult to determine except in the various workings because the entire area is covered with slope wash and alluvium. Areas of · abnormally high radioactivity, however, range from patches a few inches square to the main ore body,

from the chemical analyses by from 8 to more than 6,000 percent. Seven of the 16 samples show 25 percent or less variation, and the analyses are comparable in agreement with those obtained from the veins. The variation in the rest of the Good Will samples is so large that a radiometric analysis is obviously of little value for determining the grade of the ore. Radiochemical analyses on the two samples showing the greatest variation indicate that the discrepancy is not due to the presence of parental thorium (Th232 ) but to the daughter products of the uranium. The big difference in equilibrium of the uranium between the disseminated deposits on the Good Will property and the numerous veinlets may be due to the disseminated deposits' being in a permeable sandstone and
the other deposits' being in a relatively impermeable
rhyolite or tuff. In the permeable sandstone, ground water can circulate and separate the uranium from its daughter products.
ORIGIN OF THE URANIUM DEPOSITS
The uranium-bearing fluids that formed the uranium deposits are believed to have been derived from the same source as those that formed the uraniferous fluorspar deposits; for example, a hydrothermal fluid formed during differentiation of the younger volcanic group. Uranium content of the rocks of the younger

• Analysts, R. P. Cox and Mary Finch. 6Analysts, J. P. McClure, R. L. Daywitt, and James Wahlberg. 6 Analyst, J. P. Schuch.
volcanic group is roughly three times that of the average rhyolitic volcanic rock in the western United States, and the magma that formed them would contain the necessary uranium needed to form these deposits. The traces of fluorite found in these deposits could easily be formed by fluorine derived from the fluorine-rich volcanic rocks.
The same original source of the uranium deposits and the uraniferous fluorspar deposits is still suggested, however, by both types of deposits' containing the same rather limited suite of elements, and both types of deposits' being formed at approximately the same time (after most of the younger group of volcanics and before Lake Bonneville sediments) .
On the Good Will property the uranium-bearing fluids migrated upward, probably along the fault that lies to the east of the main workings (pl. 8). The migration of these fluids into the adjacent country rock was dependent on the porosity and permeability of the particular rock unit. In the upper part of the disseminated deposits, uranium is concentrated in some of the limestone cobbles in a conglomerate. Although this conglomerate is more permeable than the nearby tuffs, it has rather dense matrix which probably restricted circulation. As a result, replacement of the limestone cobbles has beeri limited and erratic.

MINERAL DEPOSITS

151

In the lower part of the disseminated deposits, uranium is concentrated in a tuffaceous quartz-sanidine sandstone whose high permeability permits uraniumbearing fluids to pass more or less freely through it; the moderately high porosity of this sandstone furnishes space in which uranium minerals can be deposited. The well-sorted water-laid crystal tuff that underlies the tuffaceous sandstone is slightly better sorted than the ·sandstone and is made up of the same minerals in approximately the same proportions. This tuff, however, has considerably more fine material, chiefly ash; its porosity is approximately half that of the sandstone and its permeability is many times less. The porosity and permeability of the sandstone control the deposition of the uranium..
SUGGESTIONS FOR PROSPECTING
Uranium deposits consisting of veins probably occur in several places other than those now known. The small size of the veins and the wide spacing between them, the limited size of the areas in which groups of veins occur, and the small proportion of uranium in the veins, suggest that deposits of this type are likely to be of little economic importance. l-Ienee, prospecting for uranium deposits in this area should be concentr:ated on the disseminated deposits.
The disseminated deposits in the limestone conglomerate on the Good Will property are of little economic value because the uranium occurs only as a partial replacement in parts of some of the limestone cobbles.
The disseminated deposits in tuffaceous sandstone or other equally porous rock afford the best opportunity of finding new, economically important uranium deposits in this region.· Tuffs, which are so common in the Thomas Range, contain considerable fine ash, and have a low permeability and porosity. Probably only sandstone or tuffaceous sandstone is porous enough to contain economically significant deposits . of uranium. Tuffaceous sandstone in the Thomas Range is known at three localities: (1) a quartz-sanidine sandstone that contains the uranium deposits is on the Good Will property, (2) a calcareous sandstone is at the base of the steep western escarpment of the main part of the Thomas Range at the north end of The Dell, and (3) a pyroxeneplagioclase sandstone is in the Black Rock Hills. Although the number of sandstone ·exposures are quite ljmited, these rocks, owing to their friable character, are commonly covered by slopewash where the relief is not great. For example, the sandstone on the Good Will property is nowhere exposed except in the workings and along the roads.

Because the most favorable site for the disseminated deposits is in the sandstones and the most likely areas for sandstone are generally covered, prospecting can best be carried out ih the low areas surrounding the main part of the Thomas Range by carefully crisscrossing the area with a radiation counter. One of the more favorable areas to search would be The Dell, where two of three known sandstones occur. The best radiation counter for this type of work would be a scintillation counter. because its greater sensitivity allows the user to scan a greater area and detect radiation beneath a thicker cover of overburden.
HISTORY AND PRODUCTION
The first uranium deposit discovered in the mapped area was in 1950 on the Autunite group of claims on the east side of the Thomas Range. Enthusiasm for this property was high because of ,the mistaken belief that the fluorescence produced by the opal gangue was largely due to autunite and because of several analyses which were in error by factors of 10 or more. Interest in this property died out largely in the fall of 1950 when the true grade of the deposit was found. Only sporadic development work was done from 1950 through 1956.
During 1953 and 1954 another statewide search for uranium deposits was spurred by the discovery of rich deposits on the Colorado Plateau. Several hundred claims for uranium were located in the Thomas Range. Many of these claims are entirely underlain by great thicknesses of Lake Bonneville sediments and show no abnormal radioactivity. . In April 1954 uranium ~as found on the Good Will claim. In the next two years work was mainly exploratory bulldozing of long trenches, digging of pits, and drilling of vertical holes. Through 1956 a total of 129 tons of ore had been shipped to the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission's buying station in Marysvale, Utah, and to Vitro Corp. in Salt Lake City.
In August 1954 the Buena No. 1 claim was located on the east side of The Dell, east of 'the B-ell Hill property. This property is of minor importance and exploration has been confined to a small discovery pit.
INDIVIDUAL DEPOSITS
Although the disse~inated deposit on the Good Will property is the only producer of uranium in the Thof!laS Ra~ge, a description of the vein deposits on the Autunite No. 8 and Buena No. 1 claims is also included here because of widespread inte:rest in these deposits by the miners and prospectors.

AUTUNITE NO.8
The Autunite No. 8 claim is on the east side of the Thomas Range near its south end in the SW1;4 sec. 10, T. 13 S., R. 11 W. (pl. 1). The deposit occurs on the north side of a small canyon near its mouth at an altitude of approximately 5,620 feet, and is reached by 2,200 feet of private road that joins the dirt road along the east side of the Thomas Range.

The Autunite No. 8 claim was located on July 15, 1950, by ,V. ,V. Sorenson, C. S. Boyle, and G. E. and
C. F. Wilson. The mine workings consist of two pits,
one about 40 feet long, 15 feet wide, and 10 feet deep, and the other 6 feet long, 4 feet wide, and 4 feet deep (fig. 55). No ore has been produced from the Autunite No. 8.

are well exposed on the Autunite No. 8 claim. The oldest rock is porphyritic rhyolite that contains numerous phenocrysts of sanidine and quartz. The quartz grains adjacent to the uranium deposits are smoky. The porphyritic rhyolite is overlain irregularly by black glass welded. tuff (fig. 55). Following the emplacement of these older volcanic rocks a period of erosion occurred. The area was then covered by a white vitric tuff. Beds in this tuff are generally horizontal except along the sides of canyons where initial dip in this rock may be as steep as 30°. Approximately 500 feet west of the main workings of the Autunite No. 8 the white vitric tuff is overlain conformably by about 800 feet of rhyolite (pl. 1).
One of the few faults that cut volcanic rocks in the Thomas Range has been traced from the east branch of Topaz Valley northeastward to a point about 700 ·feet northwest of the Autunite No. 8 discovery pit. This fault, 1,200 feet west of the discovery pit, has a vertical displacement of approximately 60 feet.
The deposits on the Autunite No. 8 claim consist of numerous steep-dipping small veins of uraniferous opal. Most of these veins have a general north to northwest trend and a few have a northeast trend. The veins are from one-thirty-second to one-quarter of an inch thick.
The largest and best exposed area of uraniferous opal veins is in the vicinity of the discovery pit on the east side of a small canyon (fig. 55) ; the area in which these veins are exposed is about 100 feet long and has a max:imum width of about 25 feet. The chief mineral in the veins is opal, which in some places is botryoidal. The uranium occurs in the rather rare mineral weeksite, which was originally describ~d from specimens collected by the senior author on this property (Outerbridge, Staatz, Meyrowitz, and Pommer, 1960, p. 39-52). This mineral is yellow and occurs in finely fibrous rosettes similar in appearance to uranophane. These rosettes are 0.2 to 1 mm across and are found both encrusted and interlayered with the opal. In a few places weeksite is found along fracture walls free of opal. The indices of refraction of weeksite are:
Na.=l.596 N,B=1.603 Ny=1.606
Weeksite is faintly pleochroic and does nof fluoresce under either short- or long-wave ultraviolet light. Its che~nicn1 formula is l\2(U02)2 (Si205)3·4H20.
Other vein minerals are calcite and fluorite. The calcite is common only in parts of some veins and occurs as clear crystals as much as a quarter of an inch across. The fluorite is less common than the

uranium mineral; although some of it occurs as purple crystals, most occur as small colorless crystals.
Two samples from the mineralized area, .one from an 8-foot horizontal channel cut across the west end of the discovery pit and the other from a 2.2-foot vertical channel 80 feet east of the first sample, contained 0.026 and 0.013 percent uranium, respectively (table 22) . Inasmuch as the veins are generally separated by as much as 2 to 3 inches of barren rhyolite, the grade of the individual veins is much higher. A sample of carefully selected material containing a high proportion of vein material with visible weeksite contained 0.20 percent uranium.
A second abnormally radioactive area is in the porphyritic rhyolite on the west side of the small canyon .(fig. 55), 180 feet west-northwest of the discovery pit. This area contains numerous small vertical veins with a northerly strike. The veins are in an area approximately 70 feet long by 12 feet wide. Opal is the only mineral noted. A 4-foot channel sample of the rhyolite with numerous opal veins contained 0.022 percent uranium (table 22).
A third ab:r;wrmally radioactive area occurred in the vitric tuff of the younger volcanic group, approximately 600 feet west of the discovery pit. The tuff at this locality strikes N. 10° E. and dips 5° NW. The mineralized zone is in the bottom of a narrow canyon and has an exposed length of only 10 feet and a width of 2.5 feet. Numerous small fractures in the tuff are filled with pale bluish-green opal. A 2.5foot vertical channel sample across this ledge contained 0.009 percent uranium (table 22).

GEOLOGY AND MINERAL DEPOSITS, THOMAS AND DUGWAY RANGES, UTAH

RELATION OF ORE DEPOSITS TO STRUCTURAL FEATURES
The lead-zinc-copper-silver deposits of the Dugway Range are found along faults. The two chief types of faults that localize the ore bodies are the major northwest-trending faults, including the Buckhorn thrust, and subsidiary faults related to the major ones. The pyritic copper deposits are in the shattered wall rock adjacent to the major northwest-trending faults, and the fissure veins are in quartzite and in carbonate rocks formed along the subsidiary faults. The northwest-trending Buckhorn thrust fault appears to be the major controlling structure, inasmuch as no significant deposits are known that are more than half a mile from it.
The ore bodies that occur in the fissure veins in the quartzite commonly are in a zone in which the 'largest fault or faults are complicated by minor faults that intersect the main fracture or fractures (figs. 59, 60, and. 62). Ore bodies occur in quartzite both in faults near the central part of the quartzite outcrop, as at the Lauris, Bryan, and Rattler claims, and near th~ edge of the outcrop in faults subsidiary to the major faults that separate the quartzite from the carbonate rocks, as at the Confidence, Rainbow. and Black Maria claims. At the Confidence and Rainbow properties the mineralized faults trend nearly at right angles to the major fault, and at the Black Maria property the mineralized fault is parallel to a major fault. All the mineralized f~ults in the quartzite trend north or northeast and dip eastward, and they probably formed as a result of shearing along the major northwesttrending normal faults bounding Kellys Hole and the other fault troughs to the east. Most of the known mineralized faults in the quartzite are on the east sides of the three quartzite blocks. This fact, together with the strike of the faults, suggests that a relative southeastward movement of the west or quartzite side of the major faults may have formed shear zones in the quartzite. Alternatively, inasmuch as the quartzite is the lower plate of a thrust fault, these
faults may be a series of reverse faults formed in the overridden plate. Where irregularities in the fault planes formed, podlike ore bodies were noted.
The lead-zinc deposits that are fissure fillings and replacement bodies. in the car·bonate rocks occur in small faults or shears, or in the gouge between branching faults. About half these faults strike northeast, and half strike northwest. In some areas, however, the mineralized faults have one common trend, such as in the Buckhorn area south of Bullion Canyon where most of these faults strike northwest. Small pipelike bodies are formed in some places at the june-

ture of two sets of fractures, as on the 95-foot level of the Four Metals mine and on the Fraction claim.
The pyritic copper deposits in general are irregular bodies which occur adjacent to major northwest-trending faults. The Metal States and the Surplus ore bodies occur adjacent to and in the hanging wall of the large fault bounding the southwest side of the graben that forms Kellys Hole. The Bertha ore body occurs at the northeast end of the Bertha graben between the two faults that bound the sides of this graben. Because these ore bodies are poorly exposed, little detailed structural information is available.
Ore deposits at the Bertha and J\{etal States properties and at a few other places may be close to the Buckhorn thrust fault. The heavy gouge at the Bertha suggests the proximity of this thrust plane. The attitudes of mineralized structures do not form a regional pattern. Even attempts at generalizing ·the pattern meet with numerous exceptions..
MINERALOGY OF THE ORE
The mineral assemblage of the Dugway district ore deposits. is fairly simple. The common primary ore minerals are galena, sphalerite, chalcopyrite, and pyrite. Small quantities of tetrahedrite or tennantite were noted at one deposit. The main gangue minerals are quartz, 9halcedony, fluorite, and barite. Lesser amounts of siderite, calcite, aragonite, and chlorite are present at some deposits. The primary sulfide minerals have been oxidized near the surface to produce. secondary lead, zinc, ap.d copper minerals. The principal secondary minerals are limonite, hematite, cerussite, smithsonite, hemimorphite, chrysocolla, malachite, azurite, and copper pitch. Other secondary minerals, some of which have been noted at only one deposit, are chalcocite, covellite, cuprite, hydrozincite, anglesite, gypsum, chalcanthite, jarosite, and wulfenite. The secondary minerals occur in earthy or hard nondescript masses in the oxidized zone of most deposits, and would commonly pass unnoticed but for their high specific gravity. Crystals of most of the minerals except fluorite and barite are less than onequarter of an inch across.
PRIMARY ORE MINERALS
Galena.-Galena oc~urs in most of the deposits and is the principal ore mineral. It commonly occurs as irregular veinlets or as small individual crystals scattered through a gangue of quartz or fluorite. Specimens from the upper parts of the deposits are generally altered, with the result that the outlines of the grains are irregular owing to embayment by such

MINERAL DEPOSITS

161

minerals as cerussite. Galena appears to be one of the earliest minerals formed in these deposits.
Sphalerite.-Sphalerite appe·ars to exceed galena in abundance only at the Four Metals mine. It is also found in the ores from the Bryan, Bertha, Surplus, and Francis claims and from a small prospect just north of the Ophir claim. Inasmuch as the sphalerite alters more easily than galei1a, the sphalerite may have been more abundant in the original ores than is now ~1pparent. Sphalerite is rare in surface exposures. It occurs in small veinlets or isolated crystals and ranges from dark brown or nearly black to amber yellow. At the Bryan claim sphalerite is yellow to gray brown. In general the sphalerite in the Four Metals mine is dark brown and closely associated with, but probably slightly later in formation than, galena; in places it appears to be contemporaneous wi,th pyrite.
Ohalcopyrite.-Chalcopyrite occurs as tiny inclusions along the cleavage of galena at a prosped in the central part of the Bertha graben and in trace amounts on the dumps at the Bertha, New Park, Surplus, and a few other mines. It is · probably more common, particularly in the. pyritic copper deposits, than is indicated by the observed occurrences on the dumps and in the upper parts of the ore bodies.
Py1·ite.-Pyrite seems to be abundant in some areas in the district, absent in others. In the major deposits pyrite is most common at the Four ~1etals, Metal States, Surplus, and Bertha properties; at all four, it occurs as cubes as much as three-quarters of an inch across,. scattered through a dark gray-green gougelike material. A specimen from the Surplus claim contained numerous small pyrite cubes in quartz. At the Four Metals mine the pyrite appears to be tht ln.test sulfide 'formed, for some of the crystals have cores of galena or sphalerite. Pyrite also occurs in small amounts at several properties in Bullion Canyon but was seen in only one of the veins in the Prospect ~1ountain quart'lite.
Tet1·ahedrite or tennantite.-Tetrahedrite or tennantite was found at only one locality, a prospect in the central part of the Bertha graben. Here the tetrahedrite or tennantite was noted in small grains that
occurred as replacements of galena along the cleavage planes.
GANGUE MINERALS
Q~ta1·tz.-Quartz is present at nearly every prop~ erty in the district and is the most common gangue mineral. Comb or vein quartz, fine-grained quartz, and chalcedony are found. Two generations of quartz appear to be present in some deposits, such as in the ore shoot at the Bertha mine. One variety is a fine-

grained chalcedony in narrow bands and rings associated with fine-grained hematite; the other is a coarser grained variety that forms crystals as much as 0.5 mm across and occurs in veinlets. Banded crustiform quartz is common in veins in the Prospect Mountain quartzite.
Fluorite.-Fluorite, next to quartz, is the commonest gangue mineral in the district, and is found in the quartzite at the Bryan, Lauris, Rattler, Confidence, Black Maria, Golconda, Eureka, and Rainbow properties and in the Fandangle limestone at the Great Eastern, Pride of the West, and Nautilus claims. In addition, numerous fractures containing fluorite were noted in the Prospect Mountain quartzite north and west of the Bryan claim. Fluorite occurs in two forms in the Dugway district: as colorless to palegreen cubes and octahedra as much as one-half an inch across, and as massive or columnar banded veins from less than an inch to more than 10 feet wide. The latter type of fluorite is commonly pale apple green where fresh broken, but loses its color on prolonged exposure to the sun. Massive pale-purple and orange fluorite was also noted in a few places. The columnar or massive fluorite occurs only in veins in the Prospect ~1ountain quartzite; cubes and octahedrons may occur at any of the localities. Quartz is the most common associate of fluorite. In some thin sections fluorite was seen to fill in scattered spaces between quartz grains. In a few places galena is found in fluorite.
Barite.-Barite is most common in deposits in carbonate rocks, such as those south of Bullion Canyon and J(ellys Hole, and at the Four Metals n1ine. The only occurrence seen in the veins in quartzite is at the south vein on the Confidence claim. The barite occurs as crested groups of white bladed crystals from microscopic size to crystals 1 inch or more across. One vein made up almost entirely of barite on the Juno claim is as much as 1.5 feet wide. Barite is probably one of the latest minerals formed.
Siderite.-Siderite in crystals large enough to identify is common at only a few places.. It was noted at several prospects in the vicinity of the Pride of the West claim and southeast of the Boston claim. It may, however, be a constituent of the brown altered dolomite that occurs around some of the deposits.
0 alcite and aragonite.-These carbonates are rather wid_ely distributed in the district, although they are not abundant anywhere. White calcite in rosettes made up of small tabular and scalenohedral crystals
occur in the vein at the Bryan claim. Tiny needles of aragonite were noted on cavity walls at a prospect in the Fandangle formation.

GEOLOGY Al~D MINERAL DEPOSITS, THOMAS AND DUGWAY RANGES, UTAH

Hydromioa and ohlorite.-Greenish-gray clayey patches and cavity fillings in some of the ores, as at the Bertha property, appear to be a mixture of chlorite and hydromica.
SECONDARY l'tiiNEBALS
Limonite and goethite.-No attempt ·was made to distinguish between the amorphous and crystalline varieties of iron oxide, limonite and goethite, but they are common in the oxidized zones of most of the deposits of the district.
Hematite.-Hematite is common in the ore throughout the district. It is associated with pyrite at the Bertha mine, where it obcurs as thin lamellar plates and groups of plates. It also makes up the greater part of some veins, as at the south vein on the. Confidence property.
Oerussite.-In the Dugway district cerussite is the most common of the secondary lead minerals. It· occurs in the oxidized zone of practically every deposit that contains galena. Cerussite is particularly- abun. dant at the Lauris, the Four Metals, the Confidence, a prospect southeast of the Boston, and the lead ore shoot at the Bertha. The cerussite occurs either in clusters of small clear crystals or in irregular masses. The latter occurrence is more common, and at some places, such as the Confidence and the Lauris claims, these masses niay be several inches across. The ~as­ sive mineral is commonly white to gray in color and . may be earthy or compact. A fresh surface, however, will generally show an adamantine luster. Cerussite commonly occurs as rims around galena crystals.
Smithsonite.-Smithsonite was found at only a few properties, yet, because of the difficulty of identification~ it is probably more common than the known localities indicate. It occurs at the north vein of the Francis claim as apple-green reniform and botryoidal nodules as much as 2 inches across. Elsewhere, as at the south vein of the Francis "claim, on the Juno claim, and at the surface at the Four Metals mine, it occurs as earthy masses that are white, gray, or very pale green.
H emimorphite.-The zinc silicate, hemimorphite, occurs in small amounts at a number of properties. It is not nearly as common as cerussite, but is fairly abundant at the Bald Eagle-Raymond mine, and at the Bryan claim. At both places it· occurs as sheaflike clusters of small clear crystals lining cavities.
Ohrysooolla.-The blue-green copper mineral chrysocolla is most abundant at the north adit of the Metal States property where it occurs in thin seams and pockets associated with copper oxides and carbonates. This mineral is locally common, in many

places especially along or adjacent to some of the larger faults, as at the Belcher and Black Maria claims.
Malaehite and azurite.-The two copper carbonates malachite and azurite are common throughout the district. In only a few places, such as the north adit at the Metal States property, the Black Dragon, the Belcher claim, and the Black Maria claim, are they abundant. Malachite is more common than azurite, and both are generally associated with chrysocolla and with copper pitch. Malachite and azurite commonly occur as thin films and veinlets in altered dolomite and quartzite. In a few places small rosettes of malachite crystals were noted. A thin section of material containing malachite from the Black Dragon claim south of the Raymond-Bald Eagle claim showed that some of the fibrous crystals were optically more similar to brochantite and atacamite· than malachite.
Copper pitoh.-Copper pitch, as used here, includes the black copper oxides such as melaconite and tenorite which are commonly found mixed with chrysocolla. Such material is common at the northernmost adit on the Metal States, the Surplus, and the Belcher properties.
Ohaloooite.-A few very· small grains of a soft gray mineral, probably chalcocite, were noted in a specimen from the Bertha mine.
Oovellite.-Traces of covellite were noted in specimens from the Bertha J?ine. It is also present in trace amounts at a prospect in the central part of the Bertha graben, at several prospects on the Pride of the West claim, and at a prospect just north of the Ophir claim. The covellite is generally accompanied by and replaces small grains of chalcopyrite or galena.
Ouprite.-The copper oxide cuprite was positively identified at only one place in the district, a small copper prospect on the Black Dragon claim just south of the Bald Eagle claim. A thin section revealed its presence .as small irregular stringers in the center of malachite veinlets. Cuprite may be present in small amounts at some of the other copper properties.
H ydrozinoite.-Thin coatings and patches of a mineral which fluoresces bluish white to very pale yellow were noted at a few places on ore from the Bryan claim, Morrell ,shaft, and Four Metals mine. This powdery mineral gave a strong zinc test that indicates it is probably hydrozincite.
Anglesite.-Anglesite is rare in the district. Very thin seams were found around some galena crystals iN a few specimens.
Gypsum.-Gypsum occurs at the Four Metals mine, but it is mainly associated with the pyritic copper

MINERAL DEPOSITS

163

deposits-the Bertha, Metal States, and Surplus. Most of the gypsum seen was on the dumps at these properties, where some or all of it may have forined from oxidation of pyrite. It occurs in translucent platy crystals generally less than 1 inch across. Ohalcanthite.-Fine blue crystals of copper sulfate are common on the walls of the workings and in the muck at the Bertha property and at the Four Metals mine.
Jarosite.-Reddish-brown and bright-yellow earthy material in oxidized ore at the Four Metals mine and at the south vein of the Confidence claim is mostly jarosite.
Wulfenite.-A few lemon-yellow tabular crystals of the lead molybdate, w.ulfenite, occur in cavities in altered dolomite at two prospects about 250 feet southeast of the Boston claim.
CHEMICAL COMPOSITION OF THE ORE
Four metals-lead, zinc, silver, and copper-are of importance in the ores of the Dug·way district. Only minor amounts of gold are present. Silicon, fluorine, barium, calcium, oxygen, and sulfur are the chief elements of the gangue.
Lead content.-The most widespread ore element is lead, and every sample analyzed contained at least a small amount. Some of the ore contains only lead and a li~tle silver. The assays (table 25) ranged from 0.51 percent, in a sample from the copper de-

posit in the north adit at the Metal States property,

to 45.21 percent, in a sample from the small workings

south of the main Four Metals shaft. The average

lead content of the ores of the district is probably

between 8 and 10 percent.

Although galena is abundant in most of the ore, a

large proportion of the lead produced was recovered

from ·cerussite, the secondary lead carbonate. The

scarcity of lead sulfate (anglesite) in the district is

probably due to the fact that lead carbonate is much

less soluble than lead sulfate.

Zilnc content.-Zinc is abundant at only a few mines

such as the Four Metals and Francis. Assays (table

25) ranged from 0.058 percent in the ore at the upper

tunnel on the Lauris claim to 41.48 percent on the

95-foot level at the Four Metals mine. Excluding

the Four Metals and Francis properties, the average

of the remainder of the assays is a little less than 1

percent.

·

Inasmuch as most of lhe samples were collected

from workings near the surface and sphalerite is more

soluble than galena, the zinc content· of some of the.

veins may increase considerably below the zone of

oxidation. Zinc is most common .in the fissure veins

and replacements in carbonate rock, and least com-

mon in deposits of pyritic copper ore, although small

lead-zinc veins within these pyritic copper depos-

its may be comparatively rich in zinc (table 25,

Assay data available on primary ore from the Four ORIGIN OF THE LEAD-ZINC-COPPER-SILVER DEPOSITS

Metals mine show a fairly close relation of silver to lead, that is, 1 ounce of silver is present for approximately each 5.5 percent lead. Silver content of the ore is not related to the zinc content. Thus, the silver at the Four Metals mine is probably contained mainly in galena. At many of the other deposits in the district, silver has much the same ratio to galena and is probably contained· in it. The silver content from the small lead vein at the Bertha property (table 25) and. that reported at the Buckhorn property (Butler, Loughlin, Heikes, and others, 1920, p. 462), however, are at least twice as high as might be expected from this lead-silver ratio. Hence, some of the silver probably occurs in undetected silver minerals such as

Character and sowrce of ore-formmg fiuids.-The primary minerals of the Dugway district are relatively simple and are those commonly associated with mesothermal and, to some extent, epithermal deposits. As little is known about the composition of the deposits at depth, even a brief description of the nature of the ore-forming fluids is difficult. That the fluids were of low or moderate temperature and under relatively low pressure is illustrated by the crustiform nature of the ore in some deposits, the presence of chalcedony, barite, and fluorite in most of the veins, and the lack of li~e-silicate minerals.

tuffs, and a few small altered rhyodacite dikes. The character of the ore strongly suggests, however, that the source of the fluids which formed the deposits was different from that which formed the uraniferous fluorspar and the uranium deposits in the Thomas Range.

The Dugway district was discovered In 1869 and organized in 1872 (Butler, Loughlin, Heikes, and others, 1920, p. 462). The first discovery in the district was made by Sam Gilson on the Buckhorn claim (Engineering and Mining Journal, 1891, p. 503), and

The depth of such intrusions, if present, cannot be predicted from present knowledge of the area, although the lack of contact metamorphism and prevalence of low-temperature minerals and textures suggest that an igneous source will not be found at depths of less than a thousand feet.
Age of minf!ffalization.-The age of ore formation in the Dugway district can only be approximated by inference. At the northeast corner of Kellys Hole small quartz veinlets containing chalcopyrite and galena are present in rhyodacite breccia. This rhyodacite breccia is no older than that of the older volcanic group farther south in the Thomas Range (see p. 116), as seems likely, then the mineralization is

Journal (1891, p. 704), reporting on development within the district, stated that "Dugway district has 2 stores, 3 saloons, some 30 tents and a big boarding .house. Water has to be brought 18 miles and sells for $2.50 per 40 gallons." The isolation of the district, the scarcity of water, and the .lack of timber hampered development of this area from the beginning. A small smelter near the mouth of Bullion Canyon was completed in 1876, but apparently treated only a small amount of ore. · Little is known of the production of the district prior ~o 1934. The Buckhorn had the largest production of the mines worked in the early days. Heikes (Butler, Loughlin, Heikes, and others, 1920, p. 463) estimated that prior to 1903 about 1,000 tons of ore,

probably Miocene or younger in age. The ore also mostly lead ore, was shipped from the district. The

166

GEOLOGY AND MINERAL DEPOSITS, THOMAS AND DUGWAY RANGES, UTAH

reported that in 1917 "there were three properties pro-
ducing ore, of which two * * * shipped copper ore,
and Laurel (Lauris) shipped a car of 50 percent lead ore." According to Heikes (1922, p. 447), in 1919 "lead ore containing silver from the Laurel (Lauris) mine comprised the principal part of the Dugway district's output made by four producers and aggregating 83 tons." Also according to Heikes (1928, p. 437), in 1925 the Francis claim produced 159 tons of lead ore· containing 2.54 ounces of gold, 688 ounces of silver, 1,500 pounds of copper, 97,637 pounds of lead, and about 19,000 pounds of ziric.
Production of metals from the district in 1934 and from l937 through 1951 is shown in table 26. The Four Metals mine produced about 7,000 short tons of ore during this period. The largest production from this district was attained in 1945 when nearly 2,000 tons of ore -valued at $56,679 was shipped. After the end of World ·war II activity declined, and no production was recorded in 1952 or 1953; since 1951 there has been only sporadic development work and .a few small shipments of ore. Some of the properties worked in the last ten years include the Bryan, Lauris, Four Metals, Francis, Confidence, Raymond-Bald Eagle, Bertha, and Metal States. In 1946 the Francis, leased to the New Park Mining Co. and operated by Tom P. Costas, shipped oxidized lead-zinc ore. In 1948 and 1949 R. G. Lee and Willis Smith leased the Four Metals mine and shipped a total of 322 tons of

lead-zinc ore. In 1955 lessees Hollinger and MacFarland shipped copper ore from the Bertha. There was no mining in the district in 1956.
Using (1) the estimate by Butler, Loughlin, Heikes, and others (1920, p. 462) of 1,000 tons of ore produced in the Dugway district prior to 1903 and (2) the average production of the 2 years reported from 1903 to 1934 as a yearly average for this period, the authors estimate the total production ·of the .district from 1869 through 1956 to have been about 12,000 short tons of ore. The Four Metals-Smelter Canyon group of mines has been responsible for by far the largest amount, probably about 60 percent, of the district's production.
The figures in table 26 indicate that the average recovered metal content per ton of · ore mined from 1934 through 1951 has been about 0.01 ounces of gold, 1.4 ounces of silver, 1.3 pounds of copper, 153.6. pounds of lead, and 202.7 pounds of zinc. The average value of a ton of ore was about $35. Ores mined early in the district's history were much richer, particularly in silver. Most of the ore shipped in recent years has gone to smelters at Bauer and Tooele, Utah.
INDIVIDUAL DEPOSITS
Descriptions of mines in the Dugway district are limited to those workings that were readily accessible in 1956. Most of these deposits have had at least some development work in the last 10 years. Thu~, an

· The Bertha claim is in the southeast or upper end of a narrow valley in the north-central part of the Dugway Range. This property is approximately 1 mile due ·south of the Four Metals mine and 3,000 feet east of the southern part of Kellys Hole (fig. 57). A steep dirt road leading to the property branches from the road through the northern end ·of the Dugway Range one-quarter of a mile west of the Four Metals mine.
The Bertha claim was located in the 1890's and
patent,ed on May 16, 1900, by J. B. Thompson and
associates. A little copper ore was shipped to a smelter near Stockton, Utah, around the turn of the century. Some work has been done at various times since then, the most recent being in 1955 when the property was leased to Hollinger and MacFarland who shipped 78 tons of ore to the American Smelting and Refining Co. In 1956 the property was owned
jointly by J. F. and T. Q. Cannon and J. C. Orme..
The workings on the Be~tha consist of a shaft, a prospect pit, and an adit. The pit is only about 8 feet deep ; the shaft is inclined at 41° in a N. 24° E. direction and is ~pproximately 95 feet deep. This shaft connects with the main adit by a 14-foot crosscut. The adit has approximately 400 feet of workings and is extremely irregular. A map of this adit .on the scale of 1 inch to 40 feet was made by tape and compass (fig. 58). At the base of the shaft an·other level was present, but it has been back-filled.
Geology.-The Bertha property is in dolomite of unknown age in the southeast end of a graben between two . upfaulted blocks .of Prospect Mountain quartzite. The faults bounding the downfaulted blpck join about 800 feet southeast of the portal of the adit; to the northwest, however, they diverge (pl. 1). These faults are from 200 to 400 feet apart

in part by the adit (fig. 58), but neither the southeast nor the northwest end of the ore body is exposed. ·The ore body has a minimum length of 80 feet and a width of 32 feet on the adit lev,el. Short crosscuts above the adit level expose the ore body for an additional 21 feet to the southeast and for 15 feet to the south. Near the surface the ore body has been oxidized to a brown limonitic gossan, which is well exposed near the adit mouth and around the shaft on the adit level (fig. 58). If the secondary limoniterich part of the ore body is added to the primary pyritic part, then the minimum length of the exposed ore body is 180 feet.
The ore consists of a dark greenish-gray finegrained clayey material through which are scattered numerous pyrite cubes from 0.4 mm to 20 mm across and in places small patches of covellite and malachite. A polished section shows that the ore consists chiefly of pyrite and hematite in dark-green to black claylike material. Hematite occurs in flat plates and clots which may replace the pyrite. Thin seams of chalcopyrite, in part altered to covellite, are present in the pyrite. A few very small grains of a mineral resembling chalcocite were noted, but not positively identified. Shears in the ore body and the adjoining· dolomite are commonly coated with malachite or azurite. Chalcanthite was noted on the walls of the adit in several places. The only other recognizable mineral is gypsum, which although abundant on the dump, is only rarely found in the underground workings, where it occurs along fractures.
A chip sample taken around the edge of the stope at the southeast end of the adit (fig. 58) contained 3.7. percent copper and 1.2 percent lead (table 25). The copper content of this sample agrees closely with the 3.6 percent reported by Billingsley and Lyons

near the Bertha workings and appear to dip towards (1926, written communication) from this same de-

the center of the graben; a segment of the· Buckhorn posit. The lead content is surprising, because lead .

thrust fault probably underlies this area. The rock minerals were not seen. in any of the hand specimens.

A few small pieces of lead vein similar to that described below may have been taken. in the sample.
In addition to the main pyritic copper ore body, a lead vein occurs along a small fault in the adit 6 feet west of the main ore body (fig. 58). The vein is about 4 feet long and from 1 inch to 2.2 feet thick. A winze sunk on this vein is approximately 30 feet deep. A polished section of the vein material is made up of about 35 percent galena, 20 percent cerussite, 10 percent limonite, and 35 percent quartz. Cerussite is commonly pseudomorphic after the galena. A little calcite was also noted in the vein. A thin section of a specimen from the dump, probably from this
same lead vein, consisted of 60 percent quartz, some

of it chalcedonic, 20 percent hematite, 10 percent galena, 5 percent cerussite, 1 percent hemimorphite, and 4 percent a dark brownish-green, nearly isotropic_ mineral that is probably sphalerite partly altered to smithsonite.
A channel sample (table 25) taken across this vein at its widest point contained 27.7 percent lead, 3.4 percent zinc, and 18.3 ounces of silver per ton. The silver content Is the highest of any samples given in table 25.

west of the Metal States shaft (fig. 57). The upper workings on the property are reached by a rough steep road about .5,000 feet long which branches off the main road at the divide on the north end of J{ellys Hole.
The Bryan claim is unpatented and was first located about 75 years ago. It was relocated by Margaret and George Willis Smith of Stockton, Utah, in October 1955.
Two sets of workings are on the Bryan claim. The lower group, at an altitude of 4,720 feet, is at the north end of the claim and the portal is on the adjoining I-I;arding claim. These lower workings consisted of an adit about 300 feet long with several cro:sscuts. In 1956 the portal of the adit was caved. · The upper group, at an altitude of 5,100 feet, consists of 2 small adits 15 feet apart vertically. The portnJs of both adits are in unconsolidated Lake Bonneville gravels. The upper adit is caved at the portal;

the lower adit, which is 108 feet long, is partially caved (fig. 59).
Geology and ore deposits.-The Bryan claim is entirely underlain by white massive Prospect Mountain quartzite. A, conspicuous fault zone having an easterly dip and a north-northeast trend traverses the claim. The ore occurs in veins along this structure. Surface exposures of this fault zone are poor, but in a cut near the portal of the upper workings a fault surface is exposed which dips 65° E. In the lower adit (fig. 59), fractures that dip steeply to the east and west were noted in the quartzite but the main fault along the footwall side of the ore body dips 32° to 45° E. The hanging-wall side of this ore body is not exposed but it has been stoped for as much as 35 feet along the fault and as much as 10 feet away from the fault (fig. 59). Vein material consists chiefly of
pale-green fluorite in colloform layers %, to 3 inches
thick. The fluorite shows no crystal faces and its

width suggests that this vein was from 1 to 3 feet thick. It has been worked to a depth of about 25 feet in some places in the trench, and probably does not extend far below these workings, inasmuch as a long crosscut driven on the 95-foot level under this vein failed to intersect the ore body.
The. veins in the workings approximately 600 feet south-southeast of the main Four Metals shaft are much smaller than those in the two vein systems described above. Ore is scattered along the fractures at irregular intervals and the shoots range in thickness from 1,4 to 6 inches (pl. .9) .
The mineralogy of all the veins is similar and fairly simple. The primary ore consists of galena, sphalerite, and pyrite in a gangue chiefly of quartz, but contains also some calcite and clay and a little barite. Chlorite was noted in one specimen. No primary copper minerals were noted, but the presence of chalcanthite along a shear on the 220-foot level, and the small aniounts of copper noted in the chemical analyses (table 25) indicate that some copper minerals are present. The relative amounts of pyrite_, galena, and" sphalerite vary from place to place, but sphalerite 'is generally more common than galena, .except in the working 500 feet south of the main Four Metals shaft (pl. 9, small insert). Pyrite is found not only in th~ ore shoots but also in clay along the fractures. Galena was apparently the first mineral formed, inasmuch as in polished sections it is surrounded by sphalerite and pyrite. In general, sphalerite was deposited next and then pyrite, which commonly occurs as small (0.1 to 2 mm) striated cubes perched on the other sulfides. In one place, however, the three sulfide minerals· appear to have been deposited together. The grain size of the sphalerite and galena is variable, but most crystals are between 0.5 and 1 mm across. After the sulfides the gangue minerals quartz and calcite were formed, and they fill the interstices between the sulfide minerals.
The upper parts of the veins are oxidized. Part of the ore on the 50-foot level, and probably most of the ore above this level, is oxidized; the greater ·part of the ore mined from the trench 65 feet east -of the Four ~1etals shaft was oxidized. In the oxidized ore zone, the pyrite has been changed to limonite and hematite, the sphalerite to smithsonite, and the galena to cerussite. Alteration of the galena to cerussite appears to have been slower than the oxidation of the other sulfide minerals, as the cerussite commonly sur-
rounds cores of galena in places where no other sul-
fide minerals are present.
The grade of the. ore varies markedly. By 1956·
considerable ore had been stoped from the ore bodies

on most levels and little ore was visible. Two samples were cut from pillars in sphalerite-rich parts of the main ore shoot (table 25) . The zinc content of these samples is probably higher and the lead content lower than in most parts of this ore body. All available assays of ore from the Four Metals mine indicate that the overall ratio of zinc to lead is about 2 to 1. A series of tonnage-grade figures on ore shipped by R. G. Lee and Willis Smith to the smelter in 1948 and 1949 was obtained through the courtesy of Mr. L. K. Requa and is given in table 27. The lead content of these shipments ranged from 5.7 to 12.6 percent and the zinc content from 5.4 to 23.6 percent. The relation of lead to silver (table 25) suggests that the galena is probably argentiferous.

FRANCIS
The Francis property lies across the top of a small ridge near the middle of the Dugway Range, approximately 2,000 feet southeast of the shaft on the Bertha property (fig. 57). This property is reached by ·a steep dirt road from the southeast end of Kellys Hole.
The Francis claim was patented July 17, 1894, by John F. Delaney and associates. According to the county treasurer's records, the owner in 1956 was George B. Curley of Salt Lake City, Utah. Two veins, approximately 350 feet apart, occur on or near this property. Inasmuch as the veins are similar in nature and are both referred to by ~he miners as the Francis, they are herein discussed together~
The earliest work was on the southeast vein, which had a tunnel open on both ends and approximately 160 feet long that followed the vein along a fairly flat ridge. This tunnel reached a maximum depth of about 20 feet below the surface, and the ore, mainly secondary lead and zinc carbonates, was stoped out above the tunnel. No workings are below the tunnel· level. Although some ore has evidently been produced from this deposit, no record on the amount or
grade is available.

174

GEOLOGY AND MINERAL DEPOSITS, THOMAS AND DUGWAY RANGES, UTAH

On the second or northwest vein two trenches 48 and 30 feet long (fig. 61) were dug. These trenches have a maximum depth of 8 feet. The portal of a 105-foot adit is 68 feet southwest of the vein. This adit tends northeastward and meets the vein 43 feet below the trench.. An inclined shaft driven along the vein connects the southwest end of one of the trenches with the adit. A second shaft 15 to 20 feet deep is 15 feet south of the first shaft.
Geology.-The veins on the Francis property are in the Trailer and Fandangle limestones, 300 to 600 feet south and west of the Prospect Mountain quartzite. The northwest vein is in the Trailer limestone just beneath its contact with the Fandangle, and the southeast vein is in the Fandangle limestone within 20 feet of its contact. with the Trailer limestone.
Ore .deposits.-Ore has been produced from two veins on the Francis property. The northwest vein trends northwest at the surface and dips steeply, but in the adit it trends northeast and dips 63° SE. (fig. 61). This vein is exposed for 100 feet along strike and splits into two branches near· its southeast end.

On the surface it ranges from about 2 to 6 feet in thickness; in the back of the adit, however, it is only 1 foot thick, and at the floor only several inches thick.
The vein material appears to be made up largely of limonite and clay with some malachite. Smithsonite is present locally in irregular gray, greenish-gray, or brown masses that are difficult to distinguish from the rest of the vein. Near the north end of the northernmost trench, however, a few pieces of green botryoidal smithsonite were found. No sphalerite was noted. Lead also occurs in the veins, chiefly as cerussite. This mineral is generally found in irregular gray patches; it also occurs in tiny (as much as 1 mm across) clear crystals in small vugs. One piece of galena was found on the dump. The gangue minerals, in addition to iron oxide minerals and clay, inelude calcite and a little barite.
Analyses of two channel samples taken across this . vein, one from the adit, the other from the inclined shaft 4 feet below the surface, ar~ given in table 25. They indicate that zinc is probably the chief constituent of the ore, although lead is important.

The southeast vein trends north-northeast and dips irregularly. The vein is exposed for approximately 185 feet along its strike. Most of the vein has been stoped out .to a width of 1lj2 to 3 feet.
The ore from the southeast vein is similar to that of the northwest vein. Vein material consists chiefly of hematite and limonite; locally thin films of green malachite and a little calcite are present. No ore minerals are readily visible in hand specimen, but in thin section approximately 10 percent cerussite and 10 percent smithsonite were noted in one specimen.
LA URIS
The Lauris claim is on the south-facing slope of a steep quartzite mountain in the northwest corner of the Dugway Range. This claim adjoins the Bryan claim· on the south; (fig. 57) the ore bodies on the two properties lie on the same fault zone. The southern end of the Lauris claim is about 2.1 miles S. 72° W. of the Four Metals mine, and 0.7 mile S. 4° W. of the ~1etal States shaft. The lower adit of the property is reached by a rough road about 1 mile long which joins a dirt road on the flats along the northwest side of the Dugway Range.
The deposits, now called the Lauris, were first located about 1880. · This area has formerly been called both the Laurel tunnels and the Louis claim. The Lauris claim is unpatented and was relocated October 29, 1955, by Margaret and George Willis Smith of Stockton, Utah.
Production has been intermittent from this property. Records of early production are not ·available, but according to Ifeikes (1921, p. 200; 1922, p. 447),
"·* * * the Laurel (Lauris) shipped a car of 50 per-
cent lead ore" in 1917 and "lead ore containing silver from the Laurel (Lauris) mine comprised the principal part of the Dugway ·district's output made by four producers and aggregating 83 tons in 1919."
The claim is developed by two separate workings : at 4,760 feet altitude, a lower adit that is 430 feet long and has a few small oyerhead stopes, and, at an altitude of 4,912 feet, an upper adit that is 100 feet long and has stqpes extending upward about 25 feet to the surface and downward about 55 feet (fig. 62). Most of the production has come from the smaller upper workings. · Geology and ore deposits.-The Lauris claim lies along a fissure vein entirely within the Prospect Mountain quartzite (fig. 62). In the vicinity of the adits the b.eds strike north-northeast and dip about 25° NW. The fault ·zone in which the vein occurs strikes north and consists of several bifurcating shears that dip from 60~ to 84° E. There are also a few minor

northwest-trending shears that offset the larger faults in some places.
No sulfide ore was seen in the lower adit, or on the dump, although numerous veins of light-green massive banded fluorite are present. These veins of fluorspar are from lj2 inch to 6 feet wide and generally occur as lens~s along the faults. The largest fluorspar vein is about 60 feet from the portal of the adit. This vein has a maximum thickness of 6 feet above the adit in a stope, but it pinches rapidly downward to less than a foot at the adit level. The only other minerals noted in the fluorspar vein were quartz, hematite, and limonite.
The ore body exposed in the upper workings is almost completely mined out. It lies between two faults that dip eastward 68° and 69° at the adit level (fig. 62) . The size of the stope indicates the ore body had a maximum length of about 60 feet and a maximum width of about 5 feet, and extended down dip from the. surface for about 80 feet. A pillar of ore exposed above the adit level contained 2.7 feet of ore consisting of bands of galena and secondary lead minerals and l-inch bands of fluorite. A few inches to 1.4 feet of fluorite can be seen along faults at the south end of the ore body and at the bottom of the stope.
The ore from the upper adit is made up of bands, which in one polished seCtion consisted of a lj2-inch. band containing about 60 percent massive galena, 35 percent cerussite replacing the galena, and 5 percent quartz scattered through the cerussite. Bordering this is a 2- to 3-mm band consisting almost entirely of cerussite and an outer band containing white fibrous fluorite and a little hematite, quartz, and cerussite along cracks. A thin section of a fluorite-rich band contained 15 percent quartz, in anhedra ranging from 0.5 mm to less than 0.1 mm, that filled cracks and locally replaced the fluorite. Colorless fluorite made ~p 10· percent of the section and occurred as angular brecciated and rectangular pieces as much as onequarter of an inch across. Other minerals included 10 percent hematite as opaque to dark-red clots and small plates, a possible trace of barite in small vein-
lets, a few percent clay, and small amounts of cerussite as an interlacing network in the other minerals.
A few bands of colloform quartz as much as hal£ an inch wide and some green copper staining were noted in pieces of material on t~1e dump. Much of the fluo-
rite, which when fresh is normally a pale apple green, bleaches white on prolonged exposure to sunlight.
The ore from the upper and lower adit is princi-
pally fluorite (table 25). The fluorspar in the lower adit is of metallurgical grade without beneficiation.

MINES AND PROSPECTS OF THE BUCKHORN AREA
A number of small mines and prospects ·are· in the area west of the Buckhorn thrust fault (pl. 1), east of the main divide of the Dugway ~ange, and for about 1 mile south of the head of Bullion Canyon. There are 20 patented claims in this area, including the Virginia, the first (1879) patented claim in the Dugway mining district. Most of the other claims in the Buckhorn area were patented about 1897 and have not been worked for many years. The workings are now in poor condition, and the names of many are unknown. Because they are all geologically similar they are discussed here together.
Although some of these small mines were undoubtedly worked in the 1870's the peak of activity in this part of the district occurred in the 1890's. The Buckhorn mine is reported (Heikes, in Butler, Loughlin, Heikes, and others, 1920, p. 462) to have produced in 1891 sixty tons of silver-lead ore worth about $68,000. Some of the ore was reported to contain as much as 1,800 ounces of silver per ton. Probably little or no ore has been produced from this mine since that time.. Production records are not available for any of the other mines in this part of the district.
Most of the workings in the area are small and inaccesible, and few were examined in d~tail. There are several vertical shafts having dumps, the size of which indicate several hundred feet of workings, but many of the workings must be classified as prospects consisting of short adits and small opencuts. Some of these doubtless produced small amounts of rich leadsilver ore.
Probably the three most productive mines in the Buckhorn area were the Yellow Jacket, RaymondBald Eagle, and Buckhorn. The Yellow Jacket workings, on the Yellow Jacket claim (fig. 57) at the head

Some work has been done on this deposit in recent years, although it is not known if any ore was shipped. The Buckhorn mine, which has not been worked for many years, is located 4,500 feet southeast of the northwest vein at the Francis claim. The nearest road to the mine is the one to the Raymond-Bald Eagle property. This road crosses the crest of the Dugway Range 3,500 feet northwest of th~ Buckhorn mine. The workings consist of two branching adits having a total length of about 500 feet, several short adits, a shaft, and an opencut, now mostly filled. The opencut is about 28 feet. across, 42 feet long, and a maximum of 12 feet deep as presently exposed. Most, if not all, of the ore came from this pit.
Geology and ore deposits.-Nearly all the deposits in this area are in the Fandangle limestone, princi-· pally in the lower massive part. In most places the Fandangle, normally a gray limestone, has been altered to a brownish-gray dolomite; and near many of the mineralized areas the dolomite is chocolate brown. Nearly all the deposits appear to be small replacement pockets of argentiferous lead ore. Only one prospect in this area, the Black Dragon, showed significant copper mineralization. The workings on most properties were confined to the near-surface oxidized ore. The Raymond-Bald Eagle and Black Dragon are close to the major faults separating the Prospect Mountain quartzite from the limestones. The rocks of the area are considerably broken, however, by numerous small and a few moderate-size faults having a northerly or northeasterly trend, ·and there are also a few faults with an east-west trend. All these structural features are cut off by the northwest-trending Buckhorn thrust fault which bounds the area on the east. Few, if any, of the faults just mentioned contain ore bodies. Most of the ore pockets appear to be along small shears related to these faults; some

of Bullion Canyon, consist of several opencuts, short are at or near the intersection of two such shears. No

adits, and a vertical shaft. A poor road about 1.2 consistent trend to the ore-bearing shears was dis-
