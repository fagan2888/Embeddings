GEOPHYSICAL LOGS AND HYDROLOGIC DATA FOR EIGHT WELLS IN THE COYOTE SPRING VALLEY AREA, CLARK AND LINCOLN COUNTIES, NEVADA
By David L. Berger, Kathryn C. Kilroy, and Donald H. Schaefer
ABSTRACT
Geophysical logs, drilling operations, pump-test data, and waterquality determinations are presented for eight wells in the Coyote Spring Valley area of southeastern Nevada. The wells are in an area where thick units of Paleozoic carbonate rock are overlain by Tertiary semiconsolidated basin-fill deposits and Quaternary alluvial deposits. Data collected by the U.S. Geological Survey were augmented with data from previous investigations; however, complete sets of logs and other data are not available for all eight wells. Geophysical data presented include natural-gamma, neutron, gamma-gamma density, caliper, watertemperature, acoustic, single-point resistance, long- and short-normal resistivity, and spontaneous-potential logs. Drilling penetration rates, lithologic columns, and well construction are also summarized and presented. Measurements of drawdown and recovery during and after constant-discharge pumping periods are also included. Also presented are results of chemical and physical analyses for major-ion chemistry, trace constituents, stable and radioactive isotopes, temperature, pH, specific conductance, and dissolved oxygen.
INTRODUCTION
In 1985, the U.S. Geological Survey began investigating the geology and hydrology in southern Nevada to better understand the regional carbonate-rock aquifer systems. This study, known as the Nevada Carbonate Aquifers Program (NCAP), is being made in cooperation with the State of Nevada, the Las Vegas Valley Water District, and the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation.
As part of the NCAP, geophysical, lithologic, hydrologic, and geochemical data were collected from eight wells: three wells drilled by the Geological Survey in 1985, four drilled by the U.S. Air Force for the Nevada-Utah MX missile-siting investigation, and one well that apparently was drilled as a stock well prior to 1958. Figure 1 shows the location of all eight wells, and table 1 lists identifying information for each well.

* In this taMe, each site is identified by a short well name, the local (Nevada) site-identification system, and by latitude and longitude. Except for this table, only the short well name (for example, SHV-1) Is used In the report, for convenience. The local site-identification system is based on an index of hydrograplilc areas in Nevada (Rush, 1968) and on the rectangular subdivision of the public lands referenced to the Mount Dlablo base line and meridian. Each number consists of four units separated by spaces: Tho first unit is the hydrographic area number. The second unit is the township, preceded by an N or S to indicate location north or south of the base line. The third unit is the range, preceded by an E to indicate location east of the meridian. The fourth unit consists of the section number and letters designating the quarter section, quarter-quarter section, and so on (A, B, C, and D indicate the northeast, northwest, southwest, and southeast quarters, respectively), followed by a number indicating the sequence in which the well was recorded. For example, well 217 S16 E63 09DDAB1 is In Hidden Valley (hydrographic nren 217). It in the first well recorded in the NWk of the NEfc of the SEfc of the SElt of section 9, Township 16 South, Range 63 East, Mount Dlablo base line and meridian.

The wells are in an area encompassing approximately 400 nd/; it includes Coyote Spring Valley, Hidden Valley, and the Muddy River Springs area. This area lies within the southern portion of the Basin and Range Province. Tertiary basin-fill deposits and Quaternary alluvial deposits overlie thick units of Paleozoic carbonate rock. Five wells in this study area are completed in the carbonate-rock aquifer.
The data were collected for future analysis to determine in-situ hydrogeologic conditions of the carbonate-rock aquifer, and thereby increase the understanding of regional flow systems in southern Nevada.
The authors thank the residents of nearby Moapa Valley for their assistance in completing the field work. A special thanks is given to Robert Plummer for his hospitality. We also acknowledge the support and cooperation of the U.S. Air Force for the use of their data from the exploratory MX project.
METHODOLOGY
Drilling Operations
U.S. Geological Survey Test Wells
The Geological Survey drilled three test wells: CSV-1, CSV-2, and CSV-3 during October, November, and December 1985. The drilling was done by hydraulic-rotary and air-foam methods. Table 2 lists data on drill bit sizes, casing, and drilling fluid used at these sites. Drill cuttings were collected at 10-foot intervals and where lithologic changes occurred. A solution containing a lithium bromide concentration of 20 milligrams per liter (mg/L) constituted the water part of the drilling fluid at each site. When chemical samples were later collected, a sufficient volume of water was first pumped from the aquifer so that the bromide tracer was reduced to low, natural concentrations. At each site, the surface casing was sealed and enclosed with a 5-foot section of 12-inch-diameter galvanized pipe, which was then cemented in place and capped with steel flat stock and locked.
Existing Wells
During 1980 and 1981, Ertec Western, Inc. (formerly Fugro National, Inc.) made hydrologic investigations in the Coyote Spring Valley area for the U.S. Air Force. Four deep exploratory wells were drilled and analyzed by geophysical logs, aquifer tests, and lithologic identification to assess ground-water potential as part of MX missile siting investigations. Ertec Western, Inc. (1981) has published data for two of these wells (CE-DT-4 and CE-DT-5). Some of the information presented in this report is from that published reference, while the remainder is from field notes and other documents provided by the U.S. Air Force and Ertec. A brief summary on location and drilling operations of the
-A-

four MX wells is presented in the section on geohydrologic data in this report. Table 2 lists the bit sizes, casing information, and type of drilling fluid used at the MX sites. During drilling, lithologic samples were collected at 5-foot intervals, at apparent formation changes, and wherever changes were observed in drilling conditions. Upon completion of drilling, spontaneous-potential, resistivity, natural gamma, 3-d velocity, and 3-diameter-caliper logs were run in the wells. In addition, video logs were run in CE-DT-4, CE-DT-5 and CE-DT-6. An abandoned stock well (SHV-1) was also investigated and the data
are presented in the section on geohydrologic data in this report.

Geophysical Logs
The geophysical well-log data collected by the Geological Survey were recorded simultaneously on an analog strip chart and a digital magnetic cassette. All well logs are referenced with zero depth at land surface. Table 3 lists the types of logs and depth intervals for each test well. Graphs of the logs are presented in the section on geohydrologic data in this report. Calibrations for the neutron and gamma-gamma tools are available at the Geological Survey Carson City office. The MX geophysical logs may be obtained from either the Nevada State Engineer or the U.S. Geological Survey, Carson City, Nev.

Water-Quality Analyses
Water-quality samples were collected by the Geological Survey during 1986 at wells CSV-2, CE-DT-6, CE-VF-2, and SHV-1. Previous water-quality samples were collected by the Geological Survey in 1980 and 1981 at CE-DT-4 and CE-DT-5. All samples were analyzed at the U.S. Geological Survey Central Laboratory in Denver, Colo. In addition, isotope analyses were performed at the Central Laboratory for carbon-13, carbon-14, and tritium; at the U.S. Geological Survey Research Laboratory in Reston, Va., for deuterium and oxygen-18; and at the Global Geochemistry Corporation Laboratory in Canoga Park, Calif., for sulfur-34. Results of the above analyses are presented in table 4. The data include major-ion chemistry, trace constituents, stable and radioactive isotopes, temperature, pH, specific conductance, and dissolved oxygen.
Wells CSV-2 and CE-VF-2 were pumped a total of 130,000 and 64,000 gallons, respectively, before sampling. Well SHV-1 was bailed three well volumes before sampling; however, the bromide concentration of the (ground water) sample was still above background concentrations of the area, making this sample questionable. Well CE-DT-6 is used as a water-supply well for the Moapa Valley Water District and, therefore, was pumping for several months before it was sampled. Wells CE-DT-4 and CE-DT-5 were drilled and tested as part of the MX project, so both wells were pumping for several days before they were sampled. Samples from all the MX wells are good representatives of water in the aquifer.

Aquifer Tests

Water-level drawdowns and recoveries were observed during aquifer tests on five wells that penetrate carbonate bedrock. These tests were carried out between 1980 and 1986 by Hydro Search, Inc.; Ertec Western, Inc.; and the Geological Survey. Results of these tests are presented in tables 5-13 and in figures 6, 7, 13, 14, 17, 18, 22, 23, 26, and 27 in the section on geohydrologic data in this report.

Table 1 includes water-level data for the eight wells studied.

Currently (1987), the Geological Survey is operating a continuous

water-level recorder in well CE-DT-4. Water-level information obtained

during aquifer tests is also reported in the section on geohydrologic

data in this report.

GEOHYDROLOGIC DATA FROM THE EIGHT WELLS
CSV-1
Well CSV-1 is in Moapa Valley, Clark County, and is approximately 1.5 miles south of the intersection of State Route 168 and an abandoned highway (figure 1). The well site is near the intersection of Wildcat Wash and Pahranagat Wash east of the northern edge of the Arrow Canyon Range.
The Geological Survey began drilling on October 10, 1985. The drill penetrated 765 feet of basin-fill sediments and reached ground water at approximately 344 feet below land surface. The drilling penetration rate and lithologic log are shown in figure 2. A shift in the natural gamma and neutron logs near 550 feet indicated possible bedrock and gave reason to attempt a core sample from the well bottom; however, no sample was recovered due to core-barrel damage. The well was cased with two polyvinyl chloride (PVC) piezometers: a 2-inch-diaraeter piezometer and a 4-inch-diameter piezometer (table 2). A bentonite plug was installed at a depth interval of 362 to 369 feet to prevent leakage along the 4-inch casing. The annulus was then filled with clean gravel pack from 362 feet to the surface plug. Geophysical logs for this well are presented in figure 3.

CSV-2 Well CSV-2 is in Moapa Valley, Clark County, and is approximately 3.2 miles north of the intersection of State Route 168 and Warm Springs Road (figure 1). The well site is in an unnamed drainage on the southwestern flank of the Meadow Valley Mountains and south of Farrier Wash.
The U.S. Geological Survey began drilling on October 23, 1985. Limestone bedrock was penetrated at 17 feet and the water table was reached at approximately 390 feet below land surface. Drilling continued through the limestone section until October 26, when the 8-footlong drill bit and stem broke off at a depth of 478 feet, after penetrating a large fracture and dropping several feet. Numerous attempts to retrieve the bit and stem were unsuccessful. The well was cased to bedrock with 10-inch-diameter PVC. The drilling penetration rate and lithologic log are shown in figure 4. Geophysical logs are presented in figure 5.
An aquifer test for CSV-2 was made by the Geological Survey in June 1986. Prior to this test, the well was developed by pumping for 2 days at approximately 5,500 gal/d. A 20-horsepower, 6-inch-diameter submersible pump with a 3-inch-diameter discharge pipe was used for the test. The intake was set at 430 feet. A combined total-discharge and sweep-hand flow meter was installed in-line to measure well discharge. Discharge was piped 60 feet from the well to a small wash that transported flow from the site. Water levels were measured in the well with a recording pressure transducer set at 420 feet and calibrated on site. The drawdown test lasted 21 hours with a constant discharge of about 100 gal/min. Total recovery was observed within 1 hour of stopping the pump. Tables 5 and 6 and figures 6 and 7 present the test data.

CSV-3 Well CSV-3 in Coyote Spring Valley, Clark County, is adjacent to U.S. Highway 93, approximately 7 miles south of the intersection of U.S. Highway 93 and State Route 168 (figure 1). The well site is in the southernmost part of Coyote Spring Valley, between the Las Vegas Range and the Arrow Canyon Range. The Geological Survey began drilling on November 6, 1985. Drillingfluid circulation was lost at 430 feet due to a highly permeable and unconsolidated zone identified as a washout on the caliper log. Four thousand gallons of bentonite drilling mud was used as a sealer, but circulation was not regained. On December 18, 1985, a second episode of drilling was started using a 200-gallon mixture of Suprafoam^ and Supramud to prevent circulation loss. At 515 feet, fluid circulation was lost which required thickening of the drilling fluid. On December 22, a total depth of 780 feet was attained, penetrating basin-fill deposits. The water table was reached about 580 feet below land surface, The hole later collapsed at a depth of 320 feet, and after reopening, 6-inch PVC was installed to a depth of 756 feet with 20 feet of perforated screen at the bottom. A 10-inch diameter, 7-foot section of PVC surface casing was cemented in place. The drilling penetration rate and lithology log are shown in figure 8. Geophysical well logs are shown in figures 9 and 10.

CE-DT-4
Wells CE-DT-4 and CE-DT-5 are in Coyote Spring Valley, Clark County, and are adjacent to State Route 168 approximately 3 miles east of the intersection of U.S. Highway 93 and State Route 168 (figure 1). CE-DT-4 is located approximately 300 feet west of CE-DT-5. The well sites are in the southeasterly draining Pahranagat Wash and just north of the Arrow Canyon Range.
Drilling began on CE-DT-4 on November 20, 1980. Limestone bedrock was penetrated at 30 feet below land surface, and a total depth of 669 feet was attained on December 6, 1980, when circulation loss terminated the drilling. The water table was reached at 352 feet below land surface. Due to vertical deviation of the well, cement was installed from 20 feet to the surface, drilled with a 7-7/8-inch-diameter milltooth tricone bit, and reamed with a 17-1/2-inch-diameter button bit. Three feet of 16-inch casing was set at the surface to facilitate sampling. Ten-inch-diameter surface casing was installed from 0 to 50 feet; the remainder of the hole was uncased. The drilling penetration rate and lithologic log are shown in figure 11. Figure 12 shows the geophysical well logs for the hole.
Well CE-DT-4 was tested in December 1980 by Hydro Search, Inc. The well was developed by surging five times with the drill-rig airlift at 1,100 ft-Vmin before a pump was set. Details of the pump setup are not available. The test lasted 3 days and 5 hours, and the discharge rate was about 530 gal/min (figure 13). Recovery occurred within 2 minutes after the pump was turned off and only a few water-level measurements were made (figure 14). Water-level drawdowns during pumping and recoveries after the pump stopped are shown in table 7. CE-DT-4 was also used as an observation well when aquifer tests were made at CE-DT-5.

CE-DT-5
See section on well CE-DT-4 for location of this well. Drilling began on CE-DT-5 on April 13, 1981. It was completed on May 6, 1981, at a total depth of 628 feet. Limestone bedrock was reported at 110 feet and the water table was reached at 350 feet below land surface. The well was cased with 20-inch-diameter steel casing and cemented to 126 feet. Frequent loss of circulation of drilling fluid was recorded. Two zones of significant circulation loss were encountered at 387 feet and 571 feet. The upper zone was cemented off and drilling continued through the lower zone until it became apparent that significant saturated fractures were penetrated. The drilling penetration rate and lithologic log for this well are show in figure 15. A temperature log is shown in figure 16.
Well CE-DT-5 was tested during August and September of 1981. The well was developed by bailing 37 times. The bailer held 30.8 gallons. A vertical turbine pump with 10-inch-diameter discharge pipe was used in testing the well. The intake was set at 500 feet. Discharge was measured with orifice plates and a piezometer tube, and was piped 200 feet to an alluvial channel. Water levels were measured in the well and at observation well CE-DT-4 with a recording pressure transducer. Periodic checks were made by electric sounder and barometer to correct for atmospheric-induced drift. Water levels at six other observation wells and discharge at six springs were monitored daily but no effects due to pumping were discerned. The test, which was the eighth in a series of constant and step discharge tests, lasted 30 days and 3 hours, with a 3-hour shutdown for maintenance 13 days and 14 hours into the test. The initial increase in drawdown between 0.07 and 0.60 minutes, as shown in figure 17, represents the filling of the pump column before water from the formation was pumped. Table 8 and figure 17 present data from MX test well CE-DT-5, and table 9 and figure 18 present data from observation well CE-DT-4 during the testing at CE-DT-5.

CE-DT-6 Well CE-DT-6 is in Moapa Valley, Clark County, adjacent to State Route 168 approximately 6.7 miles east of CE-DT-5 (figure 1). The well site is in the southern portion of the Meadow Valley Mountains and was drilled as an observation well for use during aquifer tests at CE-DT-5. Limestone bedrock and the water table were reached at 78 and 457.4 feet below the land surface, respectively. Drilling began on May 21, 1981, and was completed on June 3, 1981. A total depth of 937 feet was attained. Eighty-seven feet of 12-3/4inch surface casing was cemented into place and 8-5/8-inch well casing was installed from land surface to the bedrock. The drilling penetration rate and lithologic log are shown in figure 19. Temperature and caliper logs are shown in figure 20. Water levels measured from October 28, 1985, to January 28, 1986, for this well are presented in graphic form in figure 21. The Geological Survey made a 66-hour constant-discharge aquifer test December 6-12, 1986. Drawdown data are listed in table 10 and shown in figure 22. Recovery data are listed in table 11 and shown in figure 23. Water levels were measured with a recording pressure transducer calibrated onsite. Total recovery occurred within 5 minutes after the pump was turned off.

* This well does not have a foot valve; therefore when the pump is first turned on the pumping rate is high until the discharge pipe fills with water up to the surface.
a After 900 minutes, recorded water levels remained within 0.5 feet of 498.85 feet but fluctuated "randomly" about that level, perhaps due to variations in recorder power supply, barometric pressure, or pumping rate.

CE-VF-2
Well CE-VF-2 in Coyote Spring Valley, Lincoln County, is adjacent to U.S. Highway 93, approximately 4 miles north of the intersection of U.S. Highway 93 and State Route 168 (figure 1). The well site is east of Pahranagat Wash in Coyote Spring Valley.
Drilling began on December 15, 1980, and was completed sometime before April 1981 (exact date not known). The reported total depth is 1,221 feet and the water table was near 611 feet below land surface. Doloraitic limestone bedrock was penetrated at 850 feet. The well is cased with 10-inch-diameter blank casing from 0 to 860 feet and is uncased from 860 to 1,221 feet. The casing was set with cement from the surface to 50 feet and from 840 to 860 feet. Nongraded gravel pack was placed in the annulus from 50 to 840 feet. The drilling penetration rate and lithologic log for CE-VF-2 are shown in figure 24, and geophysical well logs are shown in figure 25. Another well, CE-VF-1, was drilled as an observation well approximately 300 feet north of CE-VF-2. A reported depth of 714 feet was attained, bottoming in basin-fill deposits. The water level is 593 feet below land surface, indicating a vertical gradient between CE-VF-2 and CE-VF-1.
Well CE-VF-2 was tested by the Geological Survey in February of 1986. The well was developed initially in 1981 by bailing 25 bails per day for 5^ days (16.5 gallons per bail). The pump, flow-meter assembly, and pressure transducer used in 1986 were the same as those used in the test at CSV-2. The pump intake was set at 707 feet and the discharge was piped 80 feet away from the site. The well was pumped at 77 gal/min for 14 hours, and recovery took 2 hours. The pump stopped unexpectedly due to mechanical failure and, as a result, the exact time for the beginning of the recovery portion of the test is uncertain within 1 to 4 minutes. The initial recovery measurements exhibit a great deal of scatter due to rapid oscillations of the water in the well or to problems with the pressure transducer or recorder. Despite these initial difficulties, the long-term recovery of water levels was accurately measured. See tables 12 and 13 and figures 26 and 27. Measurements of water levels in an observation well 300 feet away, CE-VF-1, showed no change during the 14-hour test. The observation well does not penetrate the carbonate aquifer.

SHV-1 Well SHV-1 in Hidden Valley, Clark County, is adjacent to U.S. Highway 93, approximately 16.5 miles south of the intersection of U.S. Highway 93 and State Route 168 (figure 1). This well was drilled sometime before 1958 on U.S. Bureau of Land Management land, apparently for use as a stock well, and is now abandoned, The well was plugged above the water table until the Geological Survey redrilled it to a depth of 920 feet in December 1985. The water table is 832.3 feet below the land surface. The caliper log indicates 5-inchdiameter casing to a depth of 45 feet and 6-inch uncased hole below. The drilling history and well construction are unknown. Geophysical well logs of this well are shown in figure 28.
