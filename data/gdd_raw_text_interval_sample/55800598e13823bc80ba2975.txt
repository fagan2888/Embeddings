GEOLOGY OF THE JOHNSON RIVER AREA, ALASKA
By G. WILLIAM HoLMES and HELEN L. FosTER
ABSTRACT
Th(! vegetation, topography. and geology of the .Johnson River area are representative of the entire eastern interior region of Alaska. This area has a vegetational cover of both boreal forest and upland tundra, has a continental subarctic climate, and is within the zone of discontinuous permafrost. The topographic units include the rolling hills of the Yukon-Tanana Upland, the terraces and moraines on the Tanana-Kuskokwim and Northway-Tanacross Lowlands, and the rugged peaks and deep canyons of the Alaska Range.
The bedrock is composed mostly of metamo·rphic and igneous rocks. The metamorphic rocks, largely schist and gneiss. have been profoundly deformed and are possibly Precambrian in age. Quartzite, hornfels, and amphibolite are minor constituents: of the metamorphic complex. The metamorphic rocks have been invaded by granitic rocks1 of Cretaceous age, and dikes of several ages cut both the metamorphic and igneous masses. Contacts between the igneous' and metamorphic rocks include contact breccias, crosscutting intrusive contacts, and a contact zone of mixed igneous and metamorphic rocks. Although the granitic rocks include granodiorite, granite, quartz monzonite, quartz diorite, and diorite, similarities in mineral and chemical composition of representative rocks and similarity in the absolute age of scattered specimens suggest that they are genetically related and probably part of a single pluton. Lead-alpha age determinations were in close agreement and ranged from 90 to 110 ( ±10) million years.
Very small depo·sits of Tert:iary carbonaceous silt and clay and T'ertiary gravel occur in the foothills of the Alaska Range. The former deposits contain a pollen flora transitional between the warm-temperate forest of the early and middle Miocene and the boreal forest of the Pleistocene.
Pleistocene glaciation of tl~e Alaska Range \vas intense and produced a variety of glacial forms, including long valley glaciers, icecaps, outlet glaciers, and cirque glaciers. The older advance has be('lll correlated \Vith the Delta Glaciation of the Delta River area and resulted in broad high-level icecaps as \Yell as long valley glaciers that extended to the Tanana r~owland. Broad sheets of gravel were deposited during the Delta advance and formed fan aprons and terraces ou the lowland. A later advance that has been correlated 'vith the Donnelly Glaciation was as extensive in the main valleys but did not form icecaps so numerous or so large as. those of the Delta Glaciation. The retreat of the Donnelly ice was interrupted by short pauses or readvances in some of the higher valleys; during its final decay, deep eanyons were carved in Delta till.
Eolian activity was probably at a maximum during and immediately following glacial advances, 'vhen the supply of silt and sand was abundant and vegetational cover was sparse. Thick deposits of loess covered the hills and terraces along
1

2 GEOLOGY OF THE: JOHNSON RIVER AREA, ALASKA
the Tanana River, and large, scattered sand dunes accumulated. Similarly, formation of patterned ground, talus, rubble, and colluvium was greater during periods of glacial climate. Phenomena of Rece.nt age such as' small end moraines and rock glaciers and pingos possibly reflect climatic fluctuations since the last major glaciation. On the other hand, terrace, flood-plain, alluvial-fan, alluvialsilt, and organic-silt deposits, although important elements in the landscape, do not appear to reflect climatic events so distinctly as glaciations or related phenomena.
INTRODUCTION
LOCATION
The Johnson River area, in east-central Alaska., is about 150 1niles west of the Canadian border, about 245 miles north of the Pacific coast, and about 150 miles southeast of Fairbanks (pl. 1). The mapped area. coincides with the U.S. Geological Survey Mount Hayes C-1 and C-2 quadrangles and the south half of the Mount Hayes D-2 quadrangle and covers about 710 square miles (pl. 1). Parts of the Alaska Range, the Tanana-Kuskokwim Lowland, and the Yukon-Tanana Upland constitute this area (fig. 1) that is named for the short, broad river that flows northward from the Alaska. Range to join the Tanana River in the Mount Hayes C-2 quadrangle.
PREVIOUS INVESTIGATIONS
The earliest major geological reconnaissance of the Johnson River area was 1nade under the leadership of Brooks (1900), who explored the Tanana River valley in 1898. Subsequently, numerous investigations were 1nade in the Alaska Range and in the Yukon-Tanana Upland; these are sum1narized in two principal publications. Mertie (1937) presented his work and that of sever.al others, including Brooks, in a comprehensive publication on the Yukon-Tanana Upland. Moffit's work of more than 30 years in the Alaska Range and adjacent areas appears in short publications as well as in an excellent treatise on the region (Moffit, 1954). Recently, detailed work has been cmnpleted by P·ewe and Holmes in the Delta River and Gerstle River areas (fig. 1), and reconnaissance studies have been made by Holmes along the Alaska Highway from Delta Junction to Tok Junction (Pewe., 1952; P.ewe and others, 1953; Holmes and Benninghoff, 1957; Pewe and Holmes, 1964 ; Holmes and Pewe, 1965 ; Holmes, 1965 ; Foster and Holmes, 1965).

the surficial deposits in the surrounding region. Distribution of the geologic units is shown on the accompanying map (pl. 1). The section on bedrock geology includes a brief ·discussion of the metamorphic and igneous rocks that underlie the area, as well as a description of younger units of limited extent; emphasis 'vas on mapping the surficial deposits and determining the Quaternary history of the area.
F-ield1.vork.-The principal field studies were made in the summers of 1957 and 1960. Six months were spent on fieldwork, about 1 month of which included bedrock mapping. Mapping 'vas done on aerial photographs (scale 1: 50,000) and on enlarged topographic base maps (scale 1: 40,000). Most of the mapping was done on foot; many different camps, established by floatplane or helicopter, served as bases for fieldwork in the hills and 1nountains. Several traverses were made by automobile along the Alaska Highway, which runs from northwest to southeast through the area, by boat along the Tanana River and its tribu:taries, and by tracked vehicles in a few areas west of the Johnson River. Preliminary reconnaissance and subsequent observations were made from light aircraft and helicopters.
Acknowledgments.-The fieldwork was done in connection with the study of Alaskan terrain and permafrost and was financed to a large degree by the Engineer Intelligence Division, Office of the Chief of Engineers, lT.S. Army. Local support was provided by the U.S. Army Cold Weather and Mountain School and the U.S. Anny Arctic Test Board, both at Fort Greely, about 45 1niles west of the area. The writers are especially grateful to numerous members of the Anned Forces at Fort Greely for their provision of administrative services, aircraft, tracked vehieles, boats, and medical facilities.
The senior author was accompanied in the field in 1957 by H. B. Groom, Jr., geologist, and L. A. Spetzman, botanist; the junior author was assisted in 19'61 by Mona Goranson. Dr. Robert Forbes of the lJniversity of Alaska examined and analyzed rock thin sections and specimens. The contributions of these coworkers are acknowledged . with sincere gratitude.
GEOGRAPHY
The area includes rolling hills of moderate height, a narrow alluvial lowland, extensive foothill ridges and plateaus, and rugged glaciercovered mountains (figs. 2 and 3). Altitudes range from about 1,200 feet in the northwest to nearly 8,000 feet in the south-central sector. The area is drained by the Tanana River and its tributaries.
The climate is cold and dry in the winter and warm and moist to dry in the summer. No weather records have been kept in the area, but at the Federal Aviation Agency station near Fort Greely, 45 miles to the

west, the mean annual temperature is 27.6°F and the mean annual precipitation is 11.63 inches. The area is in the zone of discontinuous perlnafrost. Vegetation includes boreal forest and marsh, bog and muskeg, and tundra plants. Tree line ranges from about 2,500 to 3,500 feet. The population is very sparse; most inhabitants live near Dot Lake.
RELIEF AND DRAINAGE
The mapped area includes small parts of three physiographic provinces: the Yukon-Tanana Upland, the Tanana-I(_uskok"-in Lowland, and the Alaska Range (fig. 1). The terrain of each of these physio-

graphic units in the mapped area is generally typical of the corresponding units as a whole.
YUKON-TANANA UPLAND
The Johnson River area covers a small section of the south edge of the Yukon-Tanana Upland, a large region of moderate to high, rolling, loess-covered bedrock hills and low mountains. In the mapped area, slopes are moderate to steep (1,000 to 1,500 feet), and summit altitudes are 2,000 to nearly 3,000 feet above sea level. Drainage patterns are very irregular, reflecting both the structural trends and the outlines of drainage systems of the past. Streams in this unit of the mapped area

GEOGRAPHY

are small~ sluggish, and commonly discolored by organic material. Their sources are snmnnelt, rainfall, and thas~:ed seasonal frost. These streams have a high stage during snmYmelt and may be. high later for short periods after unusually heavy rains, but even in normal years many of the smaller streams are dry in ~July and August. The larger of these streams-George, Sand~ and Billy Creeks (pl. 1)-are navigable by shallmv-draft boats for short distances during normal and high stage. Th1uskeg and bog Yegetation is common in the valleys through which these small streams flow.
The largest lakes in the mapped area lie in basins in the YukonTanana Upland; the lakes typically are enclosed on three sides by bedrock hills and on the fourth side by alluvium of the Tanana Lowland (pl. 1). They range in size from about 1.3 miles to 5 miles in maximum dimension. Precise depth data are lacking, but Lake George is probably no deeper than about 55 feet, whereas Sand Lake is no deeper than about 10 feet. The larger lakes, Twelvemile, George, Moosehead, Black, and Sand, are suitable for landings by light aircraft on floats in the summer and on skis in winter. Maximum ice thickness averages slightly more than 3 feet and varies according to snmv cover. Although all these lakes are feel by sluggish streams having a high organic content, the lake water is fairly clear. The lakes have a high population of plankton and other small organisms, including crustaceans, leeches, and \Yorn1s. These in turn support a substantial population of pike, ling cod, whitefish, and aquatic birds. The lakes are rimmed at several places by ice-pushed ridges of clean gravel or of silt and peat deposits, by foul-smelling organic-silt flats and marshes, by clean sandy beaches, or by rocky bluffs.
LOWLANDS
The mapped area includes the west extremity of the NorthwayTanacross Lowland and the east end of the Tanana-l{uskok,vim Lowlancl. These lowlands together extend from the Canadian border, \Yestw·ard in an are along the north flank of the Alaska Range and are separated by a narrmYs near the center of the mapped area (Wahrhaftig, 1965, pl. 1). The lowlands are filled with glacial and nonglacial alluvium and are covered in places by piedmont n1oraines. The unit in the mapped area is relatively narrmv but is typical of much of the physiographic provinces as a \vhole. It is bordered in places on the northeast by steep bluffs of the Yukon-Tanana lTpland, which rise as much as 1,500 feet above the lmdancl. Scattered low rounded bedrock hills, not more than about 700 feet high, rise above the alluvial deposits. On the south the lowland includes moraines having relief of about 200 feet; it is bordered by bedrock hills having relief of 500 to 600 feet. The lowland is about 1,200 to 1,700 feet above sea level. The alluvial floor

8 GEOLOGY OF THE. JOHNSON RIVER AREA, ALASKA
is incised by the Tanana River and its tributaries to depths ranging from 4 to about 75 feet. It is also marked by meander scars, pond depressions, and sand dunes not more than about 30 feet high. Bogs and muskegs, ranging from a few feet to more than 9 miles in length, are very common.
The glacier-fed Tanana River is a large braided moderately swift stream. Streamflow records from the nearest stations upstream at Tanacross and downstream at Big Delta (U.S. Geological Survey, 1957, 1958a, 1958b, 1960), give a general view of the regime of the Tanana River in the mapped area (fig. 1). Low discharge occurs in February or March; discharge then gradually increases until May at breakup time. Unlike the Yukon River, the Tanana here does not experience catastrophic floods at breakup time, because iceblock dams normally do not form. After breakup, discharge increases rapidly, reaching a peak in July or August, a time of maximum glacial melt and rainfall. Maximum discharge at this ti1ne is commonly about 10 times the minilnum flow in late winter. Streamflow decreases rapidly in September because of freezeup, and gradually decreases through the winter.
Ice cover in the Tanana River in midwinter is ·probably about 3 feet thick, but in many places it is 1nuch thinner or absent. Locally, ice may be thicker than 3 feet, usually as a result of overflow icing. The stream is heavily laden with glacial, eolian, and alluvial silt from early June through September. Large quantities of driftwood are carried by the stream owing to undercutting of the heavily forested banks. The river is navigable by boats having a shallow draft, stability~ good maneuverability, and powerful retractable motors.
ALASKA RANGE
The Alaska Range, the highest and one of the longest mountain regions in Alaska, includes such features as foothill plateaus, deep canyons, steep-sided cirques, sharp peaks, and active glaciers; all are present in the Johnson River a.rea. The mountains are composed of metamorphic and igneous rocks, mantled by various thicknesses of alluvium, colluvium, and drift. Relief ranges from about 700 feet in the lower foothills to about 3,500 feet in the higher sections to the south; altitudes range from about 2,000 feet along the north edge to nearly 8,000 feet in the upper Johnson River area.. Although the area is characterized by steep and, in places, precipitous slopes, summit surfaces of the high foothills, such as Independent Ridge, Horn Mountain, and Macomb Plateau, are nearly flat or gently rolling (pl. 1).
The major streams are glacier fed-notably the Johnson River, whose source is a compound va.Iley glwcier nearly 20 miles long. The

GEOGRAPHY

Johnson River is braided and has a ·wide, bare flood plain on which shifting channels flow during the warm season. It is navigable with difficulty by river boat in its lower course and is generally unfordable. Although no runoff data are a.vailable, the regime of the ,Johnson River probably parallels that of the Tanana River by having very little runoff in late winter and a maximmn of runoff in July or August. Overflow icings are 'videspread on the lower part of the flood plain and 1nay persist as late as early July. Much smaller streams are the glacier-fed Berry and Bear Creeks, whieh have a more regular flow and carry a lmver pereentage of silt than the ,Johnson River. Other minor streams are similar to the small streams of the Yukon-Tanana Upland because they drain muskeg-filled valleys and have low dis'charge and high organic content.
Most of the lakes in the mountains are small and lie in kettle depressions on n1oraines. Fish Lake and two unnamed lakes in the Mount Hayes C-1 quadrangle are suitable for floatplane or skiplane operations. Shorelines are comn1only marshy or boggy. Most of the small ponds do not ha,ve through-going drainage, and their water level fluctuates as a result of evaporation and preeipitation. Depths are probably 6 to 25 feet, and ice thickness in winter is probably about 3 :feet.
CLIMATE
The climate of the Johnson River area is typieal of interior Alaska.; the regime is essentially continental but is modified by 1naritime and topographic :factors. A summary of the nearest stations (Big Delta (Fort Greely), which is about 45 air miles to the northwest, and Northway, which is about 95 air miles to the southeast) presents a general idea of the temperature and precipitation means (table 1).
Winters in this part of the Tanana LmYland are cold and usually last :from October to April. Minimum temperatures, between -40° and -64° F, may be expected each winter, but short periods of above :freezing temperatures and warm winds may also occur in midwinter. Winte-r snowfall is light and the snow density is lmv; little more than 3 inches of moisture falls as snmv in the lo-wland areas. The ground is nonnally covered with snmv to a depth of more. than 1 foot.
Seasonal ehange at breakup in May is rapid. Summer, June through August, is pleasantly warm. l\{aximum ten1peratures between 80° and 90° F are common. Mean rainfall is probably about 8 to 12 inches but increases with altitude and varies considerably from year to year. Summer rain, frequently as orographie sho"'ers and occasionally as thundershowers, may be heavy at times. The onset of 'vinter is rapid, and leaves fall quickly, but the freezing of the ground and of water

bodies may take a long time. The winter snow cover may be established any time from September to December.
The strongest winds blow down the Vlalleys primarily from the southeast and at times from the sou1th. Although the southeasterly winds are probably the stronger and more frequent, especially in winter, the southerly winds a.re more important geologically. Flow of air over the range results in strong winds through the deep canyons; these winds move silt and sand on the bare flood plains in summer and, being adiabatically warmed, quickly melt snow in winter.
VEGETATION
The vegetation of the Johnson River area consists of about equal parts of boreal forest and treeless areas; the latter includes bogs, n1arshes, flood plains, tundra, and rock deserts. The following sumInary is based on an unpublished manuscript by L. A. Spetzman, who studied the area in 1957, and on the work of Benninghoff (Holmes and Benninghoff, 1957), who accompanied the senior author in adjacent areas in 1955 and 1956.
Most of the boreal forest is composed of various mixtures of white spruce (Plcea glauca), black spruce (P.1nariana), white birch (Betula resinifera), and aspen (Populu8 tremuloides). This mixed forest is typically 20 to 50 feet high and grows on poorly to well-drained soils on the rolling hills of the Yukon-Tanana Upland, the foothills of the Alaska Range, and the moraines and terraces of the Tanana Lowland. A small part of the boreal forest eonsists of nearly pure stands of white spruce, 40 to 100 feet high, that grow on well-drained low ter-

GEOGRAPHY

races or on gently sloping moraines and bedrock hills near the major rivers. A few balsam poplars (Populus taca-mahacca) occur ·with the white spruce, usually on the lnwest terraces. Scattered patches of low brush and dwarfed trees, mostly lef'6 than 20 fe.et high, occur ·within the boreal forest. These include recently burned areas 'vhere willmv of several species, alder (Alnus crispa, A. incana) aspen, poplar, and white birch have become established. Lmv brush and chvarfed trees are also found in 1nuskeg environments, on poorly drained soil in abandoned channels, in kettles, in minor valleys, and on some piedmont slopes. The vegetation includes scattered chvarf birch (Betula nmut., B. gland1.dosa), dwarfed black spruce, willow, several varieties of heath· plants, and, very rarely, larch (Larix laricina). A spongy ground cover of mosses and ~Sedges grows beneath the dwarfed trees and brush.
Treeless areas in the boreal forest include bogs, marshes, and flood plains. Bog vegetation consists mainly of sedges, mosses, heath plants, and dwarf willows. Marshes, usually bordering ponds and s1nall streruns, support a growth of rushes, sedges, reedgrass, cottongrass, horsetails, iris, poison-hemlock, and waterlilies. Flood plains, subjected to strong winds and shifting sands in smmner, and covered in places by overflo,v icings in winter, are barren or support only scattered willow or soapberry brush.
Extensive thickets of very dense brush grow in the transition zone between the boreal forest and the upland tundra, generally 2,500 to 3,500 feet above sea level. The brush includes willows, alders, dwarf birch, heath shrubs, and dwarf black and white spruce.
Most of the area between tree line and about 5,000 feet, such as Macomb Plateau, Independent Ridge, or Horn Mountain (pl. 1), are covered by alpine tundra meadows. The plants include mosses, lichens, sedges, dwarf birch, willmv, blueberry, mountain cranberry, Labradortea, mountain heather, and Lapland rhododendron. On very steep slopes above 3,500 feet and elsewhere above about 5,000 feet, vegetation is absent or consists of rock-desert flora. The latter includes lichens and 1nosses in isolated mats or cushions, sedges and grasses in tufts, forbs in rosette6 or cushions, and low creeping or matted shrubs.

PERMAFROST
Perennially frozen ground, or permafrost, is wide8pread but diseontinuous in interior Alaska (Hopkins and others, 1955). Permafrost in the Johnson R.iver area is shallmv, generally be1ow 3 to 4 feet, in fine alluvium, eolluvium, flood-plain deposits, silt and peat deposits, and loess. Its presence can be determined by probing or digging and is cmmnonly suggested by hummocks, tussocks, bog and muskeg vegetation, or· dwarfed and deformed trees. Ice in these fine deposits occurs

12 GEOLOGY OF THE: JOHNSON RIVER AREA, ALASKA
as small, disseminated grains; only rarely are large segregations or lenses exposed, and those exposures are primarily in recently excavated banks of the Tanana River. Ice lenses are probably present in pingos. The sites most favorable for near-surface permafrost are bogs and muskegs on kettles, abandoned channels, low flood plains and terraces, the piedmont and minor valleys of the Al,aska Range foothills, poorly drained uplands of the foothills, and northward-facing slopes or the floors of minor valleys in the Tanana- Yukon Upland.
Data on the occurrence of perm.afrost in other geologic units are generally lacking, but some inferences can be drawn by using data from the Big Delta and Fort Greely areas (Pewe, 1953; Holmes and Benninghoff, 1957, p. 164-171). The depth to permafrost in moraine deposits probably varies according to grain size, exposure, drainage, and silt mantle; it also varies widely in gravel deposits in which it may he shallow, as for example along the piedmont where gravel is covered by silt and is abundantly supplied with surface water. As suggested by a few well records, permafrost may be deep or absent in well-drained gra,vel and sand. Permafrost probably occurs in bedrock of the mountains and hills, but ice content is low and its presence is of little practical significance.
SETTLEMENTS AND TRANSPORTATION
The only settlement is at Dot Lake, a native village having a permanent population estimated at less than 50 persons. A few other people live on widely scattered homesteads along or near the Alaska Highway and, seasonally, in fishing and hunting cabins on the Tanana River or on a few of the larger lakes. Several sawmills in or near stands of white spruce are in the lower Gerstle River area. The only other developments of significance are a granite quarry near the Gerstle River, a highway 1naintenance ca1np on the Johnson River, and a telephone repeater station and n1icrowave communication tower in the Dot Lake area.
The main road is the Alaska Highway, a medium-duty, hardsurfaced road. Short roads lead from the highway in the lower Gerstle River area and near Dot Lake. A short gravel airstrip at Dot Lake is used by light aircraft. The Tanana River is navigable by n1otorboats and in the past ·was used by river steamers.
BEDROCK GEOLOGY
GENERAL FEATURES
The Johnson River area is underlain by metamorphic rocks which were invaded hy granitic rocks. This complex is part of an extensive terrain that underlies much of the Yukon-Tanana Upland and large

BEDROCK GEOLOGY

parts of the north side of the Alaska Range (pl. 1) . The metamorphic rocks have generally been included in or correlated with the Birch Creek Schist (Moffit, 1954, p. 94; Mertie, 1937, p. 47), a group of rocks of unknown age, but possibly early Paleozoic or Precan1brian. The granitic rocks are representative of intrusive rocks of Cretaceous age now extensively exposed in the Yukon-Tanana. Upland and Alaska Range.
Dikes ranging in composition from ultramafic to granitic cut the metamorphic rocks. They are~ of several ages; the metamorphosed dikes were emplaced before the metamorphism of the Birch Creek Schist, but Inost are unmetamorphosed and younger. The granitic rocks are also cut by dikes, whieh are mostly dacitic or rhyolitic.; some are andesitic, basaltic, or ultrmnafic.
Areas underlain by metamorphic rocks are not topographically distinct from those underlain by granitic rocks. It is generally impossible to distinguish the two types of rocks or contacts between thmn from the air or by means of aerial photographs. The nmnber of outcrops is limited by an extensive cover of glaeial deposits, alluvium (pl. 1), rublble, and vegetation.

METAMORPHIC ROCKS
OCCURRENCE AND DESCRIP~:tON
Gneiss and schist, mainly formed frmn sedimentary rocks, are the most abundant metmnorphic rocks in the Johnson River area, but some quartzite, hornfels, amphibolite, and augen gneiss are also found. Gneiss and schist compose most of Independent Ridge, and other outcrops a.re scattere.d throughout the mapped area. Massive quartzite forms vertieal cliffs more than 50 feet high on the northwest side of Bear Creek about 3.5 1niles southeast of Fish Lake, and smaller outcrops oceur in a fault block at the south end of Independent Ridge and at a few other loealities. Amphibolite crops out along Bear Creek near its contact with granodiorite, and hornfels occurs on the west side of the Macomb Plateau near the igneous eontact. Augen gneiss was only found on the east side of Chief Creek, 3 miles south·west of the Chief Creek Bridge on the Alaska Highway.
The schist is gray or tan and ranges fro1n finely erystalline, as found in some mica sehist, to eoarsely erystalline, as found mostly in quartz schist. Some mica schist has garnet porphyroblasts as large as one-third of an inch in diameter. The sehist is predominately emuposed of quartz and museovite, and a wide variation exists in the relative proportions of these two from place to place.
Tremolite also oecurs in son1e sehist. A tremolite-bearing garnetmuseovite schist on Independent Ridge contains plagioclase, quartz,

14 GEOLOGY OF THE JOHNSON RIVER AREA, ALASKA

colorless amphibole, chlorite, rutile, and apatite as minor constituents. The gneiss is predominantly gray but in some reases is tan and has
a slightly orange or pink cast, especially on weathered surfaces. It ranges from finely to coarsely banded; some gneiss is spotted, having only indistinct banding due to alined or subparallel segregations of dark minerals. The most abundant minerals composing both the banded and spotted gneiss are quartz, usually strained, but in some specimens, fractured; oligoclase or andesine; potassium feldspar, generally perthitic; biotite, muscovite; garnet; and, in some gneiss, clinozoisite, hornblende, and epidote. Quartz composes more than 50 percent of most gneiss ; few gneisses are rich in feldspars. The grain size diameter of quartz, biotite, and feldspar commonly averages between 1 and 2 millimeters. The chemical composition of a typical well-foliated garnet-bearing quartz-mica gneiss is given in table 2.
Augen gneiss, similar to that described by Mertie (1937, p. 202) in the Yukon-Tanana Upland is gray or tan on fresh surfaces but weathers to a reddish tan. It contains deformed feldspar augen as much as 3 inches long. Quartz and biotite are the other principal1nineral constituents.
"White, dense, milky quartz veins and lenses are abundant throughout the metamorphic rocks. Some veins are parallel in foliation, but others crosscut it and fill old fractures.
"White or tan quartzite beds that are as 1nuch as 20 inches thick occur interbedded with schist and as large thi1ck-bedded masses. The qua.rtz-

Hornfels is rare, but that from the west side of the Macmnb Plateau primarily consisted of quartz, plagioclase, perthitic potassium feldspar, garnet, biotite, and partly altered amphibole.

MINOR STRUCTURES AND MErl'!AMORPHIC GRADE
The metamorphic rocks in the Johnson R.iver area forn1 a complex of unknown thickness and structure. Nearly all the roc.ks are foliated, largely owing to preferred orientation of constituent minerals. Distinctive beds that could be traced fron1 plaee. to plaee were not found. In most places indications of original bedding have been obliterated. Ilowever, on Independent R.idge, quartzite beds, whieh are 20 inel1es thiek and interlayered with peliti~e schists, suggest that here foliation is parallel to the original bedding, but even these beds cannot be traced to adjacent outerops.
The attitude of the foliation ranges from nearly horizontal to vertical; southerly dips are most eommon. Dmninant strike directions are not clearly evident frmn the limited data, exeept on the north end of Independent R.idge where a strike trending west-northwest is dominant. Planes of foliation are usually wavy or ere.nulated; lineations, mostly due to parallel alinement of the axes of mierofolds, strike and clip in directions different from the foliation but were evident in only a few outerops and could not be related to larger struetures.
The 1neta1norphic rocks of the Johnson River area are the product of regional metamorphism of dominantly pelitic and psammitic sedilnentary rocks and are mostly of the amphibolite faeies. They are probably polymetan1orphie (D. M. Ragan, oral con1mun. 19·64), although the number and time of the metamorphie events have not been determined. Contact metamorphic e'ffects \Vere reeognizecl in only a few places, sueh as nea.r the margin of the granitie intrusive on the Maeomb Plateau \Vhere hornfels \vas found. Also, in some gneiss that borders the intrusiYe, garnet has altered to chlorite. Eviclenee of possible retrograde metamorphisn1 was observed in a few thin sections of metamorphie rocks not known to be near the margin of granitie intrusives. A ga.rnet-mica schist on the north side of the Tanana R.iver has plagioclase partly replaced by elinozoisite, late muscovite shear zones, and exsolution textures in plagioclase.

16 GEOLOGY OF THE JOHNSON RIVER AREA, ALASKA
AGE
The age of the metamorphic rocks of the Johnson River area is not known. Mertie (1937, p. 56) accepted an early Precambrian age for the Birch Creek Schist in the Yukon-Tanana lTpland largely on the basis of its supposed relationship to the Tindir Group, which is also Precambrian but younger than the Birch Creek Schist. Now the Tindir Group is believed to be separated from the Birch Creek Schist by a major fault~ consequently this relationship cannot be used for dating.
Isotopic methods of dating have been applied to the Birch Creek Schist in several places in the Yukon-Tanana Upland but have not yet given any proof that the schist is Preca1nbrian in age. So far, the age measurements only indica.te that local metamorphism of the Birch Creek Schist in the Yukon-Tanana Upland took place in conjunction 'vith Mesozoic plutonic activity ('Vasserburg and others, 1963). In the Johnson River area, the primary plutonic activity was probably in Cretaceous time, the period indicated by lead-alpha age determinations on zircon from the intrusions. ('Seep. 21.)
IGNEOUS ROCKS
GRANITIC ROCKS
DISTRIBUTION AND DESCRIPTION
Granitic rocks, part of a large pluton, crop out in an extensive area between Chief Creek and the Johnson River and norih of the Tanana River (pl. 1). They are dominantly granodiorite, hut granite, quartz monzonite, quart.z diorite, and diorite also occur.
·The granodiorite forms conspicuous tors on Horn Mountain and on J{nob Ridge and crops o:ut in nearly vertical bluffs along the Tanana River Prospect Creek cuts through granodiorite and has formed a narrow V-shaped valley having granodiorite walls 800 feet high. The granodiorite is generally light gray when fresh because of an abundance of light-gray and white feldspa.r phenocrysts, but upon ·weathering it com1nonly acquires a pink cast. In some places the fresh rock is also pink because it contains pink feldspar crystals. The granodiorite is commonly porphyritic, but fine- to coarse-grained equigranular types also occur. Da.rk-gray xenoliths, 1 inch ·to 1nore than 2 feet in dia1neter, are abundant in many places; light-tan quartzite fragments as much as 2 feet in diameter were found in granodiorite tors on Knob Ridge.
The granodiorite consists primarily of plagioclase, potassium feldspar, quartz, biotite, and hornblende. Accessory minerals include epidote, magnetite, orthite, apatite, zircon, sphene, sericite, chlorites, and rarely monazite. The plagioclase, generally andesine, occurs as sub-

BEDROCK GEOLOGY

17

hedral to euhedral crystals as much as 2 inches long. Oscillatory zoning is characteristic, and the cores of crystals are more calcic than the rims. Potassium feldspar crystals are mostly anhedral and commonly poikilitic having inclusions of mafic minerals, plagioclase, and apatite. Microcline is common, and much of the potassium feldspar is perthitic. Some feldspar has altered to sericite.
Quartz is anhedral and commonly shows strain shadows. Biotite is subhedral to euhedral and commonly poikilitic, containing inclusions of feldspar, magnetite, apatite, and zircon having pleochroic halos. Biotite, or biotite and green hornblende, may be present. The hornblende may have inclusions of apatite and magnetite. An amphibole displaying a very low birefringence, small extinction angle, and small optic angle occurs in many specimens. Minera.Is of the chlorite group, commonly having anomalous interference colors, have formed from the alteration of biotite and hornblende. Euhedral crystals of magnetite as much as 0.1 inch across are fairly common.
Diorite forms a small but conspicuous knob on the ridge northeast of Fish Lake and occurs in some places along the margins of the intrusions, for example, between Sand and Billy Creeks on the north side of the Tanana R.iver. The diorite is mostly dark gray and noticeably darker in color than the granodiorite. It is fine to medium grained and equigranular. It is principally composed of feldspar, hornblende, biotite, and quartz. Accessory minerals are apatite, sphene, magnetite, sericite, chlorites, muscovite, allanite, epidote, and zircon. Most of the plagioclase is strongly zoned, and some plagioclase crystals invade hornblende crystals. The potassium feldspar is commonly microcline, but in many specimens it is perthite. Poikilitic textures occur in some. Biotite is the most common mafic mineral, .but hornblende may also be present; in one specimen biotite and hornblende were intergrown. Zoned allanite crystals oecur in some diorites. The mafic minerals are eonsiderably altered in many specimens, and in general, the alteration is greater in the diorites than in the granodiorites. Routine rapid rock analyses of four representative granitic rocks from different localities in the Johnson River area are given in table 2.
The textural and compositional differences in the pluton have not been mapped; therefore, no significant distribution pattern has been reeognized. In general, porphyritic. roeks having exceptionally large phenocrysts- ! to 2 inches long-occur on the Macomb Plateau. :M~edium-grained equigranular rocks are characteristic in the area around Dot Lake and to the south of it. Porphyritic rocks having phenocrysts as mueh as 1 ineh long are common on Knob Ridge, in the hills east of the Gerstle River south of Pegmatite Creek, and in much of the area north of the Tanana River.

18 GEOLOGY OF THE: JOHNSON RIVER AREA, ALASKA
In most places preferred orientation has not been detected in the minerals of the pluton, but locally on the Macomb Plateau a weak foliation due to the crude alinement of large feldspar crystals was recognized.
Sheeting of unknown origin is locally conspicuous. The sheeting planes are 2 to 15 feet apart and may be horizontal or have a slight dip. On the ridge east of Berry Creek where the sheeting planes have a slight dip, erosion has produced topographic forms similar to cuestas.
The granitic rocks are commonly broken by two or more sets of joints. The joints are 3 to 15 feet apart, and the joint planes dip 65° to 90°. Along faults or near contacts with the metamorphic rocks where severe shattering has occurred, fractures are very closely spaced, like those found in the exposures along the north side of Prospect Creek (fig. 4). The granodiorite at Gerstle River quarry (fig. 5) has typical rectangular jointing. One set of joints strikes N. 30° E. and dips 80° N., and the other strikes N. 5° W. and dips 75° E. A set of vertical joints along the crest of unglaciated Knob Ridge strike northward, roughly parallel the ridge, and are the controlling structures in the prominent tors which give the ridge its name (fig. 6). A second set of joints strikes eastwa.rd and dips 70° S. Single monolithic graniti~

blocks or groups of blocks broken by widely spaced joints stand as

prominent features on other upland surfaces, such as Horn Mountain,

but in many places such erosional remnants were removed by

glaciation.

GENETIC RELATIONSHIPS

The mineralogy, chemical composition, and distribution of the granitic rocks of the Johnson River area suggest that they are all genetically related and probably part of a single intrusion. The variations in texture and composition are those that might be expected from differentiation and from assimilation of intruded rocks during the emplacement of such a pluton.
The rooks of the Gra,nite Mountains, 15 miles northwest of Independent Ridge and in the Mount Hayes D-3 quadrangle, may also be a part of this pluton. Robert Forbes (written commun., 1960) studied four specimens from the Granite Mountains and noted that the amphibole in them has a very low birefringence (about 0.15), a small

extinction angle (Z too 10°), and small optic angle (negative, 2V about 30° to 40°). Pleochroism is: X, light greenish tan; Y, olive; and Z1 emerald green. Amphibole having similar characteristics was noted in specimens from the Johnson River area. Forbes (oral commun., 1961) also noted that other minera.logical, textural, and chemical similarities exist between rocks of the Johnson River area and those of the Granite Mountains.
CONTACTS
Contacts observed between the granitic and metamorphic rocks are of three types: zones of contact breccia, crosscutting instrusive contacts, and zones of mixed granitic and metamorphic rocks.
A zone of contact breccia 600 feet or more wide is exposed along Prospect Creek. The breccia consists of angular, randomly oriented fragments of gneiss and schist in a granitic matrix. The fragments, which range from less than an inch to more than 15 feet across, are believed to have come from adjacent metamorphic rocks. Only a few of them show alteration megascopically that can be attributed to effects of the invading granite. A second type of contact breccia was found on the west side of Independent Ridge. Here the contact zone is 20 to 100 feet wide, pink biotite-hornblende granite being separated

fr01n biotite-quartz schist by white mylonite or a breccia of white quartzite in a granitic matrix.
In most conta.cts the granodiorite cuts across the foliation of the metamorphic rocks without visible evidence of physical or chemical disturbance of 'the rock, except that, in places, the metamorphic rocks are somewhat more fractured than those at a distance from the contact. Contact zones where igneous and metamorphic rocks are complexly 1nixed occur on the north side of the Tanana River and west of Fish Lake. The zones are as much as 0.5 mile across.

AGE

The granitic rocks of the Johnson River area were presumed to be of Mesozoic age by Moffit (1937, p. 215) because of their similarity to other granitic rocks of Mesozoi·c age in the Alaska Range. Leadalpha age determinations on zircon in granodiorite from four different localities in the Johnson River area confirm this by indicating a Cr~taceous age. T. W. Stern, U.S. Geological Survey (unpub. data, 1960) reported the following lead-alpha ages:

9. Granodio·rite from Alaska Highway, three-fourths mile northwest of

Dot Lake (near sample 2, table 2) ------------------------------ 110±10

The close agreen1ent in lead-alpha ages of granodiorite from several localities separated from one another by metamorphic rocks is further indication that the intrusive rocks are probably part of the same pluton.
DIKES

Dikes are abundant in the Johnson River area and cut both the metamorphic and granitic rocks. A few mafic dikes in the metamorphic rocks have been metamorphosed along with the strata that they intrude, but most of the dikes are not metamorphosed. Many of the dikes are granitic or aplitic and are probably offshoots of the pluton. Other dikes are rhyolitic to ultramafic, exhibit a variety of textures, and cut the plutonic rocks as 'vell as the metamorphic rocks. Descriptions of several different representative types of dikes follow. Only felsite dikes were mapped and are shown on plate 1.
An ultramafic dike about 4 feet wide cuts porphyritic granodiorite along Prospect Creek. The contact between the dike and granodiorite is sharp. The dike is fine grained a1ong its margins but more coarsely

22 GEOLOGY OF THE! JOHNSON RIVER AREA, ALASKA
crystalline in the interior. It consists of biotite, clinopyroxene, and carbonate minerals. This dike and other mafic or ultramafic dikes exposed along Prospect Creek are offset by numerous small faults having displacements of 1 to 5 feet. In the Johnson River area, ultramafic dikes were only found in the Alaska Range in the southernmost part of the m,apped area.
A fine-grained basaltic dike that strikes east cuts porphyritic granodiorite near the summit of a hill on the north side of the Tanana River about 4 miles northwest of the month of the Johnson River. Small aplitic dikes also cut the granodiorite in the same locality. Finegrained basaltic dikes seem to be somewhat more abundant north of the Tanana River than south of it.
Two dikes of fine-grained, equigranular quartz monzonite cut porphyritic granodiorite on the northwest side of the tributary valley that joins the Johnson River at the south end of Independent Ridge. The dikes, one 20 feet wide and the other 50 feet wide, do not have chill zones, and their contacts with the granodiorite are sharp. Small aplitic dikes and stringers also occur at this locality, as they do throughout the granodiorite of the pluton.
In the roadcut 1 mile northwest of Dot Lake a greenish-gray porphyritic fel·site dike, altered and much weathered, cuts the granodiorite. The dike strikes about N. 40° E. and dips 55° W. Similar dikes of various widths are numerous in this vicinity.
Light-gray, cream-colored, and light-pink rhyolitic(~) dikes are abundant in the area south of Dnt Lake. They contain well-terminated quartz phenocrysts in a fine-grained groundmass. The dike rock is shattered, and fragments one to a few inches across show distinct conchoidal fracture.
STRUCTURAL RELATIONSmPS AND FAULTS
The Johnson River area includes that part of the Alaska Range that is north of the great arcuate Denali fault. In the Johnson River area, the highly deformed and structurally complex metamorphic rocks that compose this northern block of the Alaska Range appear to be continuous with the rock'3 in the adjacent Yukon-Tanana Upland (pl. 1). Although metamorphic rocks, similarly deformed, compose the exposed basement throughout most of the Yukon-Tanana Upland, other parts of interior Alaska and the Yukon Territory, Canada, details of their structure remain unknown in most areas.
Geomorphic features, such as the high, steep, north front of the Alaska Range, triangular facets, and the Tanana Valley, are suggestive of a system of faults along the north front of the Alaska Range in the Johnson River area. Highly sheared and crushed zones occur

BE:DROCK GEOLOGY

23

in the granitic rocks exposed in the Tanana Valley, but distinct offsets and significant differences in lithology on the two sides of the valley have not been recognized.
Two high-angle faults have been mapped (pl. 1) at the south end of Independent Ridge, and in the stream valley southwest of the south tip of the ridge several zones of crushing occur.
A fault in granodiorite, striking about N. 80° E. and dipping steeply westward, is exposed in the roadcut 1 mile northwe.st of Dot Lake, but it cannot be traced because of vegetational cover. A zone of fine gouge one-fourth to one-half inch thick grades eastward into a 5-foot-wide zone of crushed rock. Mylonite borders the crushed rock on the east. Nearly vertical felsite dikes also cut the granodiorite in the shear zone at this locality.
On the granodiorite ridges south of Dot Lake, ,small topographic highs that are offset from the connecting parts of the ridge suggest that movement occurred along nearly vertical planes. Associated zones of mylonite were found, but outcrops were poor and the zones could not be traced.
SEDIMENTARY ROCKS

CARBONACEOUS SILT AND CLAY
Upper Tertiary sedimentary rocks of silt, clay, and thin carbonaceous l·ayers occur on a tributary of the Johnson River between Horn Mountain and Macomb Plateau (fig. 7). The beds apparently are gently inclined to the north and are at least 150 feet thick. A description of a section in which two carbonaceous layers are exposed follows. This section is considerably thinner than most; the base of all exposures observed is apparently covered.

fers Picea, Pinu.s, and Tsuga (two species); broad-leaved tree genera Betula, Aln'us, Oarya, J'Ltglans ?, Quercus?, and Tilia; IleaJ; ferns Dryopteris, Osrnunda cinnamomea, and Adiantum; and dub moss Lycopodiu-rn. Benninghoff (Benninghoff and Holmes, 1961) regarded these beds as possibly Pliocene, because they contain a mixture of conifer ·and broad-leaved tree pollen and hence differ from the temperate middle Tertiary floras and those of the Pleistocene. However J. A. Wolfe (written commun. 1964), believes the Johnson River beds are no younger than Miocene in age, because the pollen assemblage contains several exotic genera which Wolfe thinks are not of Pliocene age in Alaska. Wolfe (written commun., 1966) further believes that the Johnson River pollen assemblage looks like that from the upper part, but not the uppermost unit, of Wahrhaftig's Nenana River coalbearing formation (Wahrhaftig, 1958, p. 10; MacNeil and otJhers, 1961, p. 1806), which Wolfe regards as Miocene in age.
The lithology and occurrence of these beds indicate that they were deposited in a deep but small basin and that they were mostly derived from local granitic rocks at a time when the foothills of the Alaska Range possessed moderate to high relief.

NENANA GRAVEL
A small patoh of poorly consolidated, deeply weathered, brown, well-rounded gravel, resembling the Nenana Gravel, occurs on the north end of Independent Ridge. It is apparently flat lying, is at least 8 foot thick, rests on a surface approximately 1,600 feet above the Tanana River, and is composed of pebbles, cobbles, and boulders as 1nuch as 0.9 foot in diameter. The gravel is composed of quartz, schist, quartzite, diorite, and granite.
Moffit (1954, p. 146-147) describes similar deeply weathered, partly consolidated gravel on the west side of the Gerstle River, and near MacCumber and Morningstar Creeks in the mountJains south of Delta Junction, which is outside the mapped area. Poorly to partly consolidated, deeply weathered, and apparently pre-Pleistocene gravel on tJhe north flank of the Alaska Range is generally correlated with the Nenana Gravel. In the Nenana River region, this gravel in places unconformably overlies the Tertiary coal-bearing formation. On the basis of one fossil (Trapa bispinosa), the Nenana Gra.vel had been tentatively assigned an age of middle Miocene or younger. Pollen floras in the Nenana Gravel resemble pollen floras from nonmarine sediments in the Aldan River valley of northeastern Siberia that were 'thought (MacNeil and others, 1961, p. 1806) to be of late Miocene or early Pliocene age. More recent pollen studies suggest that the Nenana Gravel is younger than the carbonaceous silt and clay deposits and is probably of Pliocene age (J. A. Wolfe, written commun., 1964) .

26 GEOLOGY OF THE JOHNSON RIVER AREA, ALASKA
GLACIAL GEOLOGY
Pleistocene glaciation in this area consisted of two major episodes that are correlated with the Delta and Donnelly Glaciations of the Delta River district (Pewe, 1952; Holmes, 1959). Minor advances occurred during the waning phases of Donnelly Glaciation and again in the Recent. Glacial ice flowed from scores of cirques in the central part of the Alaska Range-notably from those at the head of the Johnson River glacier (fig. 1). The ice flowed down the main valleys and emerged on the Tanana Lowland as piedmont glaciers. Several other ice masses remained cirque glaciers or valley glaciers. Small icecaps formed on the high rolling foothills and were the sources of one or more outlet glaciers. Existing glaciers in the mapped area are very small compared with the Johnson River glacier to the south (fig. 3), but most have deposited large moraines in the past few thousand years; many of the modern moraines have developed into active rock glaciers.
DEPOSITS OF THE DELTA GLACIATION
DISTRIBUTION
End moraines of the Delta Glaciation, the oldest recorded here, are poorly exposed and appear usually as subdued, partly buried moraine remnants. Only a narrow rim of the Delta end moraine is exposed in the Little Gerstle (fig. '8), Berry, or Bear Valleys (pl. 1). In the lower Johnson River valley, the Delta end moraine is not exposed. The only well-formed Delta end moraine not overridden by younger glaciers lies on Dry Creek. Small, modified Delta end moraines occur in some of the hanging valleys on the north rim of Horn Mountain.
'Ground moraine, on the other hand, is extensive and r~sts on high bedrock shoulders flanking the Gerstle River valley, on Horn Mountain and Macomb Plateau, and on the uplands extending southeastward from Berry Creek (pl. 1). The distribution of this drift indicates it was deposited by several icecaps on surfaces 3,500 to 5,500 feet above sea level. The large icecap in the Macomb Plateau and Berry Creek areas was fed in part by small cirque glaciers in the high mountains. Hm,vever, because it was as high as independent cirque glaciers nearby, much of the icecap was probably above firn limit; and it was, therefore, nourished from its own accumulation area.
Movement of the ice, as suggested by the present topography and by the distribution of till, was down Berry and Bear Creeks to the northeast, down Dry Creek to the north, and in a westerly direction toward the upper Johnson River. The Macomb Plateau ice probably merged with a valley glacier in the Johnson River valley to nearly fill this deep trench. Ice on Horn Mountain probably moved radiall! and pos-

sibly merged with the Macomb Plateau ice on the south. Extensive ice sheets covered the high, nearly flat surfaces along the west side of the Little Gerstle depression. Sources of this ice lay in the high terrain southwest of the mapped area (fig. 1). The present topography sug- · gests that ice in the upper Johnson River valley moved northwestward through the low, broad trough connecting the Little Gerstle and Johnson Valleys. Here it merged with ice from the upper Little Gerstle area and deposited an end moraine (fig. 8).

FORM

Delta moraines retain little of their original character, except for

those in the Little Gerstle River and Dry Creek valleys. Elsewhere,

kettles, knobs, and ridges have been modified by stream erosion,

especially during the younger glaciation, and by mass movement, frost

action, sheet wash, and eolian deposition. End moraines of the Delta

Glaciation have a maximum thickness of about 200 feet and local

relief not exceeding about 100 feet.

Microrelief on end moraines includes well-weathered, scattered,

partly buried boulders, tussocks, hummocks, and solifluction lobes.

Ground moraine is mostly smooth, as, for example, on Macomb Plateau.

Here the terrain is marked only by widely scattered erratic boulders,

a few ponds, and frost features. The most obvious are parallel or

dendritic patterns ("horsetail drainage" lines). Smaller features in-

clude solifluction lobes, nonsegregated circles (tussocks and hum-

mocks), segregated circles (stone polygons) and stripes (stone

stripes), and thaw pits.

Delta till has been modified elsewhere by mass movement; the result-

ing mixed deposits have the characteristic surface features of collu-

vium or rubble. On Horn Mountain, Delta ground moraine has been mixed with debris from underlying bedrock (pl. 1). In the upper

Bear Creek drainage area, Delta till, although not mixed with bedrock,

has been deeply disturbed by frost action and mass movement on steep

slopes; it is mapped as a subunit-disturbed and modified Delta mo-

raine deposits.

LITHOLOGY

Moraine deposits of the Delta Glaciation are composed of all locally

available rocks in a matrix of light-yellowish sandy silt. As the Delta

glaciers were very extensive and spread laterally over the rolling up-

lands, the source materials were well mixed, so that no obvious differ-

ences in the lithology are apparent throughout the area. Iron oxide

staining has penetrated to the base of the deepest exposure; on the

southwest edge of Horn Mountain, oxidation has reached a depth of

at least 10 feet. Loess cover on the moraines is normally thin, except

in swales.

OUTWASH DEPOSITS
Melt water from Delta glaciers deposited great volumes of gravel which filled the Tanana Valley and some of its southern tributaries. These deposits occur as fan aprons, sueh as those along the front of the foothills west of Berry Creek, or appear to be closely related outwash aprons attached to piedn10nt moraines, such as those east of Gerstle River. However, in all occurrences the gravel has been modified by stream action or partly covered by younger out,vash, alluvium, or colluvium, so that the boundaries cannot be drawn with accuracy. The deposits, although chiefly of Delta age, are designated on plate 1 as gravel, undifferentiated. The gravel is composed of light-yellowish, well-rounded, poorly sorted, and poorly stratified cobbles and pebbles of granitic rocks, schist, gneiss, quartzite, and minor amounts of mafic and ultramafic rocks, all in a matrix of sand and silt. The gr3!vel is ironstained in the upper 3.5 feet, and distintegrated fragments occur to a depth of at least 12 feet. Loess, commonly 1 to 2 feet thick, covers the gravel.
On the western part of Macomb Plateau (fig. 9), glaciofluvial gravel forms a narrow, isolated ice-contact ridge, about 1 mile long and 100 feet high, terraced on both flanks, and com.posed of coarse, rounded, and washed gravel. Its isolated position on a rolling till-covered

30 GEOLOGY OF THID .JOHNSON RIVER AREA, ALASKA
plateau, its composition, and its form suggest it was deposited in a large open channel in the Delta icecap during the downwasting of this glacier. Although it is possible that a small icecap of the Donnelly advance formed on the Macomb Plateau, the isolation of this gravel ridge from the inferred position of the younger icecap, or from Donnelly drift, suggests it was associated with the Delta Glaciation.
Gravel, probably of the Delta Glaciation, forms isolated terrace remnants along the Alaska Highway west of Dot Lake and along the Tanana River northeast of this village.

yons. The Johnson River glacier of the Donnelly advance reached and probably deflected the Tanana River (pl. 1, fig. 1) and may here have completely buried the moraine of the Delta Glaciation. In the Little Gerstle River lowland (fig. 8) and on Berry and Bear Creeks the Donnelly glaciers almost reached the outer limit of the Delta moraines (pl. 1). The large Donnelly glacier on the Robertson River to the southeast (pl. 1, fig. 1) likewise almost covered the older drift.
Donnelly ice may have formed a small plateau glacier at the head of Dry Creek. A well-formed Donnelly moraine (fig. 10), clearly separated from the Delta n1oraine dmvnstream, indicates that Donnelly ice occupied this valley. The absence of a cirque at the head of this valley suggests that the Donnelly glacier flowed from a small plateau glacier. Ground moraine resembling Donnelly till lies near the head of this valley. The presence of a small Donnelly plateau glacier is also inferred from evidence for large-scale stream erosion of the Macomb Plateau. A deep branched canyon, having steep slopes and a V-shaped

32 GEOLOGY OF THEl JOHNSON RIVER AREA, ALASKA
profile, has been cut in Delta till on the west edge of Macomb Plateau about 2 miles north of Prospect Creek. The stream that formed it deposited a large fan on the floor of the Johnson River valley. The small stream presently flowing out of this canyon is markedly underfit, and the drainage area is only slightly larger than the maximum dimensions of the branched canyon. This suggests that melt water from a lingering Donnelly plateau glacier formed this canyon system in late glacial time.
Elsewhere, small Donnelly moraines lie in a few cirques along the north edge of Horn Mountain, and on upp-er Prospect, Berry, and Bear Creeks, small, distinct end or lateral moraines are found within a few miles of the cirques. These represent short readvances during late Donnelly time.
FORM
Donnelly end moraines consist of closely spaced, steep-sided ridges, clusters of hillocks, and many depressions containing ponds or bogs. Although nearly all Donnelly moraines have been breached by existing streams, drainage on the moraines is poorly developed. Only rarely are the ponds part of a through-going drainage system, so that pond levels fluctuate markedly through the year in response to precipitation or evaporation. Donnelly moraines range in thickness from about 30 feet in the small cirques to about 300 feet for the largest moraines on the rnaj or streams.
Most Donnelly moraines are covered by large, slightly weathered, closely spaced boulders; a notable exception is the large Johnson River n1oraine which lies in the paths of dust storms from both the Johnson and Tanana Rivers. The blanket of loess, a:bout 3 feet thick, has buried most boulders. Patterned ground is not common, except for ice-wedge polygons, tussocks, and hummocks, chiefl'y in bogs on the moraine.
LITHOLOGY
Donnelly till is composed of the local bedrock including granite, gneiss, schist, and quartzite, and minor fractions of mafic and ultramafic rocks. Most Donnelly moraine deposits consist of a mixture of these rock types. The matrix is a gray, olive-gray, or yellow-brown sandy silt. The upper 1.5 feet is weathered and contains stained and disintegrated schist, gneiss, a.nd granitic rocks. It is mantled by 0.1 to 3 feet of loess. In a few areas, such as the valley immediately north of Prospect Creek and the small hanging cirque north of the summit of Horn Mountain, Donnelly till is composed almost entirely of granitic material.

GLACI·AL GEOLOGY

OUTWASH DEPOSITS
In a few areas discrete outwash aprons of the Donnelly Glaciation can be mapped, such as the apron on the north and west side of the Johnson River moraine, but else"·here this gravel has coalesced with or blanketed older outwash or alluvium of various ages. Much of the Donnelly outwash is included in the unit designa.ted gravel, undifferentiated, and cannot be easily distinquished lithologically or topographically from older oubvash or alluvium. The reason for this is that after the deposition of Delta outwash aprons, which, as stated, coalesced with contemporaneous nonglacial fan deposits, major trenching did not occur because of the loss of volume and competence of the streams as they emerged from the mountains and filtered into the gravel of the Tanana Lowland. During the next major episode of deposition, the Donnelly advance, melt water reworked the older outwash before burying it with sheets of gravel and obscuring preexisting channels. Flights of terraces were not formed, and the result was a. composite deposit similar to an alluvial fan or fan apron.

LATE DONNELLY GLACIAL ADVANCE
In the upper Prospect, Berry, and Bear Creek valleys, lateral and end moraines are 'vithin a. few miles of the present glaciers (pl. 1). The lateral ridges have smooth profiles, are commonly discontinuous, and terminate in crescentic end moraines that have been breached by present streams. They are covered by slightly weathered boulders and tundra vegetation and have been weathered to depths of 0.5 to 1 foot. These characteristics suggest they are Pleistocene rather than Recent in age; they are, therefore, tentatively correlated with a minor late Donnelly advance. Evidence for such an advance a.ppears in some but not all valleys in the vicinity (Holmes and Pewe, 1965; Holmes, 1965).

DEPOSITS OF RECENT GLACIERS
Small end moraines lie against existing glaciers at the head of Prospect, Berry, and Bear Creeks. Similar mora.ines occur in cirques now free of ice, for example, at the head of the valley immediately north of Prospect Creek.
These moraines consist of one or more steep-sided bouldery ridges (figs. 11, 12). Some moraines enclose small ponds or dry depressions; most have been only slightly eroded by melt-water streams. Some moraines have moved or are moving downslope and consequently ha.ve developed the characteristic crescenti c surface ridges typical of rock glaciers (see pp. 35-37). The boulders are closely spaced, unweathered or very slightly weathered, and are commonly unstable. Vegetation is sparse or absent.

FROST ·ACTION AND MASS MOVEMENT

35

The moraines are composed mostly of granitic fragments and minor amounts of gneiss and schist. The matrix is a compact gray, sandy silt; the till has no 'veathering profile.
The appearance of these mora.ines and their association 'vith existing glaciers indicate they represent advances in Recent time. Similar moraines occur throughout the Alaska Range and in n1any alpine areas of North America.

FROST ACTION AND MASS MOVEMENT
ROCK GLACIERS
Rock glaciers are conspicuous features in the tTohnson River area, as they are in the central Alaska Range (vVahrhaftig and Cox, 1959), in the Wrangell Mountains (Capps, 1910), and elsewhere in the mountains of interior Alaska. Most of those in the Johnson River area appear to originate mostly from Recent moraines; it is difficult, therefore, in the absence of deep and extensive e~cavations, to map their upper boundaries. The inferred boundaries shown are based on surface indications. Wahrhaftig and Cox (1959, p. 418) suggest that the zone of conical pits in the debris marks the head of the rock glacier. Another indication is the upper limit of crescentic furrows, extension fractures, and other surface signs of movement.
All rock glaciers mapped share the general characteristics of those reported elsewhere in the Alaska Range. They are covered with large angular blocks which rest on a thick layer of smaller boulders, pebbles, sand, and silt. Their surfaces are marked by crescentic ridges and furrows, bowed in a downslope direction (fig.13), and by longitudinal ridges. The surface boulders are encrusted with lichens, and the frontal slope is steep and exposes bare unweathered debris (fig. 12). No rock glacier was observed that had a distinct wall of debris facing upslope and separating it from the true end 1noraine; this is a common feruture of rock glaciers in the Nenana River area to the 'vest (Clyde W ahrhaftig, written commun., 1962). The material resembles till hut also contains products of rOickfall, frost action, and abrasion of moving debris along the valley.
The rock glacier in the southwestern part of the area (frontispiece) is of particular interest because it has unusual length, it terminates below the tree limit but has forest vegetation as well as shrub and tundra plants on its upper surface, its forward motion can be observed, and it is an example of a rock glacier composed of both morainal material and talus.
The debris feeding this rock glacier originates at the lower end of a small glacier in the Mount Hayes C-2 quadrangle, at an altitude of about 5,850 feet. It extends 3 miles to the east on a fairly even gradient

36 GE:OLOGY OF THE JOHNSON RIVER AREA, ALASKA
to the terminus U~t about 3,000 feet. The maximum width is about 0.4 mile, and the minimum thickness is estimated at 150 feet.
This rock glacier is composed mostly of light-yellowish granitic debris having minor constituents of mafic rocks. The :frontal slope (fig. 14) exhibits the characteristic line dividing the moving upper part from the lower talus sheet, which is derived from the moving wall of debris.
The lower part of the top surface. is covered by vegetation (fig. 14), including scattered tundra plants; birch, alder, and aspen shrub; and spruce trees. The vegetation is growing on a thin patchy soil containing peat. The spruce trees grow on the rock glacier surface to an altitude of about 3,100 feet, the approximate tree limit on the valley sides nearby. Based on tree-ring counts, the age of the largest spruce trees is about 150 years. Shrub vegetation grows to an altitude of about 3,400 feet.
The movement of the :front of the rock glacier can be observed at times. In June 1960, boulders and smaller fragments were sliding down the bare front at intervals of 1 or 2 minutes, freshly uprooted trees from the upper surface were seen on the advancing front, and trees in the path of the rock glacier were freshly gouged by sliding rocks. The north side of the rock glacier about half a mile from the snout has recently moved laterally as indicated by the exposure of unweathered debris on the flanks and encroachment of boulders over the tundra vegetation.
Most of this rock glacier appears to be derived from morainal material, as indicated by the till-like composition of the moving :front and by the upslope m.erger with a Recent moraine of a small existing glacier. However, the large talus fans on the south valley wall con-

tribute some debris at present, as shown by the encroachment of fresh talus over the weathered boulders of the south flank of the rock glacier. The degree of encroachment is minor within the mapped area but becomes increasingly important near and west of the map botmdary.
The volume of the rock glacier, its relationship to a Recent moraine, and the weathered surface boulders suggest it was formed several hundred or several thousand years ago. The establishment of a mature stand of trees on its surface suggests that it may have become inactive. However, the current encroachment of fresh talus on the surface of the glacier, the actively moving front and flanks, and the disruption of its surface rvegetation suggest that it has recently been reactivated.

TALUS
Sheets, stripes, and fans of angular frost-riven talus fragments have accumulated on steep valley and cirque walls in the mountains and foothills. Only the larger talus sheets are shown on the map; thin, discontinuous sheets and narrow stripes of talus mantle nearly all the steep slopes at higher altitudes. Most of the larger accumulations occur on granitic slopes, such as along Prospect Creek and on the south side of the large rock glacier. Two generations of talus slopes are evident: old talus, having weathered blocks covered by lichens, a;nd modern unstained and lichen-free talus, forming under present climatic conditions. A few small talus sheets beyond the glacial limit may date from the earliest glaciation, but most old talus probably formed since the Donnelly advance. The latest renewal of talus forma-

tion possibly coincided with the reactivation of the large rock glacie.r in the southwest part of the area.
RUBBLE
Debris, formed from local bedrock sources by frost action and not transported any significant distance, mantles the upland surfaces of the unglaciated foothills or glaciated surfaces that have not been ice covered since the Delta advance. The best developed rubble fields are on Horn Mountain, Macomb Plateau, and Knob Ridge and are underlain mostly by granitic rocks. On Horn Mountain rubble lies on low eminences on the periphery of this plateau. Frost action has formed patterned grotmd features, including segregated rings, nets, loops, and stripes, or nonsegregated steps, lobes, spot .medallions, and hummocks. Rubble on Horn Mountain has formed since the Delta Glaciation. Freshly upturned boulders and broken turf in the centers of segregated rings indicate frost processes are still active. On Knob Ridge rubble blocks are very large; some are arranged in faint patterns. The blocks are lichen covered, and in places shrub or tree vegetation which has become estrublished among the blocks indicates that

the rubble is not actively forming at this locality now. Rubble here may have formed at any time, except the present, since or before the earliest glaciation.
COLLUVIUM
Undifferentiated colluvium.-Broad sheets of gravity-moved debris, consisting of varied mixtures of loess, rubble, alluvium, and bedrock fragments, cover the sloping upland surfaces of some unglaciated foothills. The most extensive sheets rest on Independent Ridge and on the prominent hill northwest of Fish Lake. Downslope movement of colluvium is clearly indicated by the prominent solifluction lobes on Independent Ridge. Colluvium has been forming since or before the earliest recorded glaciation in this area.
Colluvial till.-Modified ground moraine mixed with loess, rubble, alluvium, outwash, and possibly other till occurs on the steep walls of the upper Johnson River valley and the Little Gerstle Lowland, on the glaciated summit of Horn Mountain, and in upper Dry Creek valley. Colluvial till may occur as smooth sheets, such as those on

40 GEOLOGY OF THE JOHNSON RIVER AREA, ALASKA
steep valley sides; it may exhibit patterned ground features, such as segregated nets and circles or stripes and steps; or it may occur as nonsegregated hummocks, spot medallions, and soil stripes, such as those on the summit of Horn lVlountain. Because this material has been mixed with others, it cannot be mapped as ground moraine; and because it may consist of ground moraine of more than one age, it cannot be assigned to a single gla-Ciation. Although the basic constituent is till, it normally contains more silt and angular fragments than normal morainal material. The age of the material ranges from the Delta Glaciation to the Recent.
PINGOS
Two pingos have been identified in the mapped area, and two other large mounds have been tentatively identified as pingos. Pingos are generally believed to be the result of movement of ground water upward or laterally in or just above the permafrost to a point where large ice lenses form and the overburden is lifted.
The best formed pingo (figs. 15, 16) in the mapped area is about 4.5 miles east of Sand Lake, in a minor valley tributary to the Tanana River. It is immediately north of the break in slope between the loess~

A moderately dense stand of birch and a few white spruce grows on its flanks and rim and reflects better soil drainage than the surrounding black spruce muskeg. Shores of the pond are obscured by leaning trees that move down on slump blocks on the inner slopes of the cra:ter. The outlet, dry in midsummer, is on the right side of the picture.

covered bedrock va.lley side and the silt-filled valley floor. The valley floor is covered with black spruce muskeg vegetation which grows on saturated organic silt overlying a shallow permafrost table. The height of the pingo is 46 feet, and its diameter at the base is about 310 feet. It is nearly symmetrical in plan and has in the crater a circular pond, which at times drains through a narrow outlet on the west. The grade of the slopes ranges from 20° to 30°. The crater sides are 3!ctively slumping; blocks of silt, some having trees on them, have slid toward the pond. The outer slopes are also fractured, but downslope movement of blocks is minor. The pingo is covered by birch and white spruce trees as much as 6 inches in diameter at breast height and a turf mat of moss, sedge, and heath piants. The upp~r 18 feet of the pingo, as shown in the exposed sides of the crater, is composed of light-graybrown laminated sandy silt having scattered angular fragments of granitic rock; most are as much as 4 inches in diameter, but a few are as much as 1 foot across. Gently inclined lenses of arkosic sand, thin layers of peat, and lenticulaT orange mottlings show that the bedding of the pingo dips radially. A fragment of spruce collected from the silt at a depth of 2.5 feet on the north rim of the crater yielded a radiocarbon age of 7,010± 150 years B.P. (Reidar Nydal, Norwegian Institute of Technology, Trondheim, written commun., 1961, sample T-303). That the upper 3 to 5 inches of the silt is stained brown indicates a weakly developed subarctic Brown forest soil profile. As a well-developed subarctic Brown forest soil may form in less than 4,000 years in this area (Holmes and others, 19~H6), the age of the pingo is probably no greater than a :few thousand years.
A smaller pingo, 1.3 miles southwest of Dot Lake village and in a similar environment, is on the edge of silt-filled, unglaciated valley at the fuot of a loess-covered granitic slope. Its maximum height is about 25 feet, and it is about 100 feet in diameter at the base. The vegetation consists of small spruce and alder shrub, and aspen trees as much as 1 foot in diameter. Muskeg vegetation grows on the valley floor around the pingo. The pingo is composed of sandy silt. In a collapse depression at the summit, a subarctic Brown :forest soil is exposed; the typical reddish-brown horizon is at a depth of 1.2 to 2 feet. Such a soil profile can develop in this area on well-drained silt younger than the Donnelly Glaciation. This soil profile suggests that this pingo is older than the one described previously.
A pingolike mound, about 2.5 miles west of Sand Lake and identified from the air as well as from aerial photographs, is about 30 feet high, 300 feet in diameter, and covered by birch and spruce trees. Like the pingos visited, it lies in a muskeg near the edge of a silt-filled valley. Another pingolike mound, identified on aerial photographs

FROST ACTION AND MASS MOVEMENT

43

and of the same dimensions as the foregoing hillock, lies near the edge of a muskeg 1.3 miles northwest of the northwest arm of Lake George.
The pingos in the mapped area are representative of several hundred pingos identified in central Alaska (Holmes and others 1963, 1966) and are the open-system type as defined by Miiller (1959).

PATTERNED -GROUND
Geometric soil patterns are common on till, colluvium, and rubble, as mentioned in foregoing sections on these deposits. At present, active movement and formation of patterned ground occurs only above altitudes of 4,800 feet, a.s on Horn Th1ountain. The most distinct segregated patterns are in material derived largely from granitic sources (fig. 17). Geometric forms on surficial material derived from schist, for example on Independent Ridge, are nonsegregated hummocks or lobes.
At lower altitudes, hummocks and tussocks are widely distributed, especially in bogs and muskegs. Frost-wedge or frost-crack polygons are present in only a few bogs at lower altitudes. Well-formed polygonal furrows in bare outwash gravel of Donnelly age are typical la,rge-scale frost features in the nearby Delta River district (Holmes

and Benninghoff, 1957, p. 112) but were not observed in this area. Here the nearly continuous mantle of loess and silt and the deeper snow cover may have inhibited formation of patterned ground in gravel.
ALLUVIAL DEPOSITS
ALLUVIAL SILT
Fine alluvium lies in nearly all valleys of the Yukon-Tanana Upland and unglaciated foothills in the mapped area. These valley-filled deposits are nearly flat, covered mostly by bogs and muskegs, marked by ponds and a few pingos, and slightly incised by narrow streams. They merge upslope with colluvia-l aprons and loess (both unmapped) and terminate on the downstream edge in low scarps along the streams. The deposits are composed of poorly to well-stratified brown, gray, or black sandy silt, having variable amounts of peat and scattered bedrock fragments. They are derived largely from loess and weathered schist or granite.
Deposition of the alluvial silt has probably taken place continuously since the earliest glacial advance. Radiocarbon dating of wood in the upper layer of alluvial silt in a pingo shows that deposition was taking place as late as 7,000 years ago. Incision of these deposits by modern streams and formation of a scarp dividing the silt deposits from the low terrace of the Tanana. River indicate that deposition at the present is minimal and probably is confined to mass movement a.long the latera.] borders of the deposits.
TERRACE DEPOSI'TS
Nearly continuous low terraces lie along the Tanana River and in the lower valleys of some of its southern tributaries. They ·are 10 to 20 feet above the river, as much as 30 feet below the outwash terraces, and about 10 feet below the nonglacial alluvial silt deposits. These terraces are easily distinguished from outwash or alluvi•al silt deposits by meander scars; they are also marked by shallow boggy depressions filled with organic deposits, tributary channels, and silt-covered sand dunes. Only the largest areas of organic deposits are shown on plate 1; many smaller areas of silt and peat occur on these terraces.
The terraces are composed of as much •as 16 feet of laminated sandy silt having layers of peat overlying poorly sorted gravel, some of which contains rounded boulders. The underlying gravel is interpreted as older outwash gravel that was not scoured below the present stream level. As these terraces lie below and against outwash terraces of the Donnelly Glaciation, they are probably Recent in age. These extensive deposits constitute the best forest land in the mapped area. Smail but

ORGANIC DEPOSITS

45

exploitable stands of white spruce grow on the terraees near the banks of the larger rivers.
ALLUVIAL FANS
Individual and coalescent alluvial fans occur throughout the area. The most extensive of these flank Independent Ridge and fill the Gerstle River lowland to the west. Another large group of fans is on the east side of the J olmson River and north of Prospect Creek. These fans were largely derived from the deep canyon cut in the Macomb Plateau.
Fans are composed of locally derived fragments of angular bedrock or till and are typically poorly stratified and sorted. Most are covered with loess and turf. Nearly all fans lie in canyons or on slopes covered by Donnelly glaciers; hence, their 'age is late glacial or Recent. As nearly all fans are gullied, the major phase of fan accumulation has apparently given way to dissection.

FLOOD-PLAIN DEPOSITS
Alluvium is exposed on the surface of active flood plains of most of the 1nountain strean1s and the Tanana River. On the Gerstle, Johnson, and Tanana Rivers, alluvium occurs as islands surrounded by braided channels. These channels shift laterally during the warm season; hence, the distribution of alluviu1n shown on the map is merely suggestive of their pattern and represents only the occurrence at the time the base-map data were compiled. On the larger streams the flood-plain gravel is incised by dry channels and is mantled by migrating sand sheets. The alluvitun consists of glacial silt, sand, well-rounded gravel, and boulders; it is poorly sorted and irregularly stratifi~d. Pa,rts of the flood plain are covered by overflow icings in winter. In summer, silt is blown from the flood plains and deposited as loess on the terraces and nearby moraines.

ORGANIC DEPOSITS
Alluvial, eolian, and lacustrine silt mixed with peat and finely divided organic material ocmus throughout the area in swales on summ.its of the foothills, in kettles and channels on the Inora,ines, in channels cut into coarse gravel along the foot of the mountains, in channels and lake depressions on the low terrace along the Tanana River, and in the valleys of the unglaciated hills north of the river. The surface of these deposits is commonly marked by earth hummocks or sedge tussocks, and bog or marsh vegetation is characteristic.
'11he silt is well stratified, "\veil sorted, poorly consolidated, and light brown to blaek. Depending on drainage, weathering may produce a mottled gray and brown Half Bog soil or a black Bog soil.

46 GEOLOGY OF THE JOHNSON RIVER AREA, ALASKA
Organic silt has been accumulating continuously since or before the Delta Glaciation. Younger silt rests in swa1es on Donnelly moraines and outwash or on post-Donnelly terrace deposits and alluvial silt deposits.
BEACH RIDGES
Well-formed gravel ridges lie along the edges of Lake George, Twelvemile Lake, and Moosehead Lake. The ridges are continuous, except on the most precipitous shores. Normally more than one persistent ridge is present-in places as many as six-from 2 to 15 feet above the shoreline. Most are composed of unstratified sand and wellrounded gravel, but some consist of silt or organic silt.
The terraces are formed by the movement of lake ice during breakup and by thennal expansion of the ice in winter. The gravel ridges make relatively good sites for vacation cottages, as they provide good foundations, are adjacent to the best sand beaches, and provide good drainage for disposal of waste.
EOLIAN DEPOSITS
SAND DUNES
The largest sand dunes occur near the lower Gerstle River; these are in the form of ridges as much as 15 feet high and 3 miles long and are oriented in a northwest-southeast direction. They are composed of yellow to light-gray, well-sorted, crossbedded sand, and most are covered by 1 to 3 feet of loess. These dunes rest on the low terrace deposits, which are post-Donnelly in age. The loess and vegetation cover show that they are not being formed at present.
For1nless tree-covered sand sheets lie along the Alaska Highway west of the Gerstle R.iver. These deposits are typically less than10 feet thick and contain shallow dry depressions and ponds. The sand is medium yellow, well sorted, and crossbedded. These deposits cannot be outlined on aerial photographs and do not appear on the map; however, a hint of their general distribution is the occurrence of the small dry or pondfilled depressions.
Small sand sheets are moved by the wind across the flood plains of the Gerstle and Johnson Rivers. These deposits, which are not mapped, are as much as 5 feet high and may be 30 to 50 feet across. They are composed of fresh gray sand derived from the flood plain.
Formless blowouts composed of well-sorted sand occur on the north side of the deep branched canyon on the west edge of Macomb Plateau. The sand appears to be derived from the bare till slopes of the canyon and probably was deposited in cliff-head dunes. The age is probably late glacial.

LOESS
Loess is widely distributed and is especially thick on the moraines near the Johnson and Little Gerstle Rivers and on the bedrock hills north and south of the Tanana River. It is not 1napped. Loess thickness is typically 1 to 3 feet, the greatest thicknesses being along the banks of the major rivers. The loess is a light-brown, faintly stratified, wellsorted sandy silt. In well-drained localities a reddish-brown subarctic Brown forest soil has developed; in poorly drained areas a mottled gray and brown Half Bog soil has formed. Loess has been deposited from the times of Delta Glaciation to the present. Reworked loess occurs in organic silt, alluvial silt, terrace deposits, and colluvium, all which are shown on the map.

SUMMARY OF GEOLOGICAL HISTORY
In Precambrian ( ?) time a very thick sequence of sedimentary rocks was deposited and later metamorphosed, faulted, and folded. The intensity of metamorphism and deformation was sufficient to obscure nearly all vestiges of original structure and stratification. These rocks, here identified as the Birch Creek Schist, probably were elevated and eroded before the next younger rocks were deposited. Although P.Jeozoic and Mesozoic rocks are not preserved in the mapped area, their occurrence elsewhere in the Alaska Range testifies to a long sequence of sedimentation (Capps, 1940, p. 130-131).
Defonnation and batholitic intrusion of the Alaska Range occurred at intervals during Cretaceous time (Payne, 1955), and at least some of the granitic rocks in the mapped area ''ere emplaced then. Later, the n1ountains were eroded to a low relief. In Eocene time clay, silt, gravel, and coal were deposited in nearby local basins (Wahrhaftig, 1958, p. 10), such as near Jarvis Creek v1est of the mapped area (Wahrhaftig and Hickcox, 1955). In late Tertiary time the coal-bearing formation was deformed, and the associated uplift of the Alaska Range resulted in the deposition of the Nenana Gravel (Moffit, 1954, p. 183). Carbonaceous silt and clay beds were also deposited in local basins, such as those which formed near the. Johnson River.
The Inost recent eleva.tion and the creation of major drainage systems of the Alaska Range occurred before the Delta Glaciation. Glaciers at that time flmved from high cirques and formed icecaps on several of the flat-topped foothills, such as Horn Mountain and ~1acomb Plateau. Most of the large valley glaciers of this advance developed into piedmont ice tongues and deposited broad moraines on the floor of the Tanana lowland. However, there is evidence that a glacier reached the mouth of the Johnson River during the Delta Glaciation. During this glaciation several discrete outwash plains were formed, some of

48 GEOLOGY OF THE JOHNSON RIVER AREA, ALASKA
which merged with gravel from nonglacial mountain streams. This outwash probably was graded to nonglacial silty alluvium from the Yukon-Tanana Upland.
The Donnelly Glaciation was almost as extensive as the Delta advance in ~the 1najor valleys but was appreciably less extensive on the upland surfaces. In the Johnson River valley, Donnelly ice moved at least to the banks of the Tanana River and may have deflected the river toward Lake George. Donnelly outwash deposits are restricted to small aprons and terraces near the major end 1noraines; other gravel of Donnelly origin is coalescent with older gla.cial outwash and with nonglacial gravel. A late advance, probably a readvance of Donnelly g-laciers, has been recorded in a few high, well-sheltered valleys, and modern glaciers in Recent time have formed moraines in several high cirques.
The deposition of organic silt, eolian sand, loess, alluvial fans, and flood-plain deposits, and the formation of talus, rubble, colluvimn, low terraces, pingos, rock glaciers, and beach ridges, although not reflecting in all cases events so distinct as glaciations, have continued to play important roles in the modification of the landscape throughout the late Pleistocene and into the Recent. The varying intensity of talus formation and ~the developn1ent of rock glaciers are probably reflections of clima.tic fluctuations in post-Wisconsin time.
