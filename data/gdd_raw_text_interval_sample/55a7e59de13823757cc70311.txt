LOW-FLOW DATA FOR SELECTED PARTIAL-RECORD STATIONS IN OHIO
By Ronald R. Schwartz
ABSTRACT
This report presents low-flow characteristics of the 67 lowflow partial-record stations defined in Ohio since October 1978. Low-flow characteristics presented are the 7-day 10-year low flow, the 7-day 2-year low flow, and the flow equalled or exceeded 90 percent of the time. The 7-day 10-year low-flow ranged from 0 ft3/s to 239 ft3/s. The methods used for estimating these characteristics also are discussed.
INTRODUCTION
Knowledge of low-flow data for Ohio streams is essential to the planners and developers of water resources for municipal, industrial, and recreational uses in the State. A stream's adequacy as a water-supply source, its capacity to assimilate liquid wastes, its adequacy as a source for irrigation, and its suitability as a habitat for aquatic life all may be evaluated in terms of its low-flow characteristics (Riggs, 1972, p. 1). Perhaps the most significant use of low-flow estimates is by State and local governmental agencies for determining the permissible rate of waste disposal into a given stream. In Ohio, this permissible rate is based on the 7-day 10-year low flow of the receiving stream (Ohio Environmental Protection Agency, 1978, p. 67).
Previous investigations of the low-flow characteristics of Ohio streams include reports by Cross (1963, 1965, and 1968), by Anttila (1970), and by Johnson and Metzker (1981), the latter report contains low-flow characteristics based on data through the 1978 water year.
Purpose and Scope
The purpose of this report is to present the low-flow characteristics defined at 67 low-flow partial-record stations since 1978. The low-flow characteristics presented in table 1 are the 7-day 10-year low flow (7Q 10 ), the 7-day 2-year low flow (7Q2 ) i and the flow equalled or exceeded 90 percent of the time (Qgo)» The low-flow characteristics for stations included in the previous reports are not repeated in this report.

This report was prepared by the U.S. Geological Survey in cooperation with the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency.

METHODS USED TO DETERMINE LOW-FLOW CHARACTERISTICS AT PARTIAL-RECORD STATIONS

Low-flow partial-record stations are stream sites where baseflow measurements have been made over a period of several years (usually two to three measurements per year). Locations of the stations for which data are presented in this report are shown in figure 1. Low-flow partial-record stations do not have enough data available for frequency-curve or flow-duration analyses. Instead, the base-flow measurements are correlated with those from a hydrologically similar continuous-record gaging station (index station) at which the low-flow characteristics are well defined. The correlations are made by plotting on log-log paper discharge measurements of base flow at the partial-record site against the concurrent flows at the index station. A straight line is fit to the plotted points by the linear least-squares method in order to establish the correlation. By determining the low-flow characteristics at the index station/ the low-flow characteristics at the partial-record station can then be estimated.
Zero flows do not lend themselves to the correlation method because they cannot be plotted on log-log paper. Partial-record sites with one occurrence of zero flow were assigned a 7Qjn of zero. Partial-record sites with two or more occurrences or zero flow were assigned 7QjQ, 7Q2 , and Qgg values of zero.
An example of the correlation method is illustrated in figure 2. Concurrent flows are plotted for the index station (Big Darby Creek at Darbyville) and the partial-record site (Little Darby Creek near Irwin). The data used to develop the correlation are:

A straight line is then fit to the plotted points by the linear least-squares method. The 7Qig, 7Q2 r and Qgo low-flow values for Big Darby Creek at Darbyville are 5.3 ftvs, 18 ft 3 /s, and 22 ft3 /s; respectively (Johnson and Metzker, 1981). Using the correlation between the two stations, the 70^0, 7Qo, and Qgo low-flj>w values for the partial-record site are 1.4 ft3/s, 3.4 ft 3 /s, and 4.0 ft 3/s; respectively. The low-flow values at the partial-record siiLe are calculated from the least-squares equation. The plotted points are used for visual verification of consistent data.
SUMMARY
The low-flow characteristics for 67 partial-record sites since October 1978 are tabulated in this report. The low-flow characteristics presented are the 7-day 10-year low flow, the 7day 2-year low flow, and the flow equalled or exceeded 90 percent of the time. The 7-day 10-year low flows ranged from 0 ft 3 /s to 239 ft 3/s.
