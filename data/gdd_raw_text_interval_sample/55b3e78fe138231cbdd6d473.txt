interesting. Analyses indicate that the petrifactions

percent of ferric carbonate. Although these materials

C. beinertianus has a somewhat larger sclerotic pith enclosed by partly confluent primary bundles that show a strong tendency toward endarchy, particularly in the smaller ones. The leaf trace departs as a single mesarch
xylem strand. In 1911 Zalessky 7 erected a new genus, Eristophyton, f
for these two species and suggested that the similarities

PRESENT STATUS OF THE CALAMOPITYEAE
The known representatives of the Calamopityeae have been carefully studied and reviewed in recent years by several paleobotanists, including Scott and Jeffrey/a Zalessky,2 and Scott,3 and some new types indicating a considerable diversity in structure in the group have been brought to light. It is not necessary, therefore, to dwell at any great length on the historical aspects of the investigation of the group, though it is essential to review rapidly the major morphologic features of several of the species that are more or less
allied to the form described here as new. Prior to 1901 the known species of Calamopitys
were those originally described from Saalfeld, Thuringia, by Unger 4 and more completely elaborated by Solms-Laubach.5 The first of these, Calamopitys saturni Unger, is the type of the genus, although still imperfectly known. The most significant features of this species are the narrow zone of secondary wood with numerous broad rays, the distinct, centrally mesarch xylem strands, the large pith, and the primitively monarch leaf traces dividing after their departure from the stele into several small bundles to form the
Kalymma petiole. From the same deposits Solms-Laubach recognized
a second species, Calamopitys annularis, referred to Stigmaria by Unger.6 This form is similar in most respects to Calamopitys saturni but differs in having a nearly continuous zone of eccentrically mesarch primary xylem, in the presence of medullary tracheids,
and in minor features of the leaf trace.

original group of C. saturni Unger, on the other, might be analogies and that the species are far removed in

their affinities. Though it has been shown that this

similarity between Eristophyton and Calamopitys in the

strict sense is actual, Zalessky's segregation is regarded

as a valid one, although Eristophyton is placed by some

authorities as a subgenus and by others as a genus.

The latter course is preferred by the present writer. / · The group of Calamopitys conforming to the strict

definition based on C. saturni Unger has been segregated by Scott 8 in the subgenus Eu-Calamopitys.

Scott,9 is scarcely distinguishable from C. annularis (Unger) Solms-Laubach on the basis of p.resent

information. In view of their occurrence at widely

separated localities they have, however, been regarded

as probably distinct.

Calamopitys ridiata Scott is rather distinct from any

of the species so far mentioned. In the apparently mixed pith, the large exarch primary xylem strands,

and the greatly dilated rays there are features which

are undeniably of specific worth. No leaf traces have

been observed. In addition to these segregates in the original genus,

two new genera that appear to be closely related to

Calamopitys have been recently defined.10 The first of these, Endoxylon Scott, is diagnosed as follows: 11

Here and there cavities of apparently lysigenous origin are found in the cortex. These are apparently secretory, although no evidence of gum deposits was observed. Similar" canals" lie in the parenchymatous portion of the mixed pith.
Leaf trac~.-In the features so far enumerated and discussed nothing has been observed which indicates that Diichnia kentuckiensis is a particularly significant type. In fact, it may be safely said that apart from its organization in the vicinity of the node the structure is of little interest. However, the n10de of origin and development of the leaf traces introduces several peculiarities which have not been previously recorded in the family.
To insure clarity a series of diagrammatic drawings have been prepared (fig. 10) from sections that illustrate the stages in the departure of the traces. These will be referred to in the discussion of the general features of the bundles, and the details of structure will be illustrated in the plates.
ln .plate 30, figure 1, are shown two primary bundles that have become tangentially elongated. Thes~, it will be ob;;_erved, are at adjacent angles of the pith.
Se-parating them is a considerable expanse of seconqary xylem in .direct ~ontact with the parenchyma~ous central area. Plate 32, figure 8, illustrates on~ of these bu~ulles at a higher magnification. The pr toxylem isclearlydivided into inner and outer groups, nd the inner appears to have undergone further diviswn.
A slightly more advanced stage is represented diagrammatically in text figure 10, a. Theprimaryxylem of each of the two strands has divided into two roesarch bundles, of which the inner ones are reparatory strands and the o:uter the leaf-trace strands. This stage is · show~ . in more detail in plate 31, figure 4, plate 32, figure 4, and plat~ 33, figures 2 and 4. It
will be-noticedthat the xylem.of the reparatory strands
is quite eccep.tricJilly 'mesarch, approaching endarchy. In the specimen shown in pla-te 32, figure 4, a further division .in the reparatory strand has taken place. The primary xylem o_f the leaf trace is, however, centrally mesarch.
A more advanced stage in the development of the trace is shown in text figure 10, b, supplemented by plate 30, figure 2, and the intermediate stage shown in plate 30, figure 3. Before discussing these in detail one very striking feature must he brought out. There is .a very noticeable lag in the anodic bundle. That is to say, the kathodic bundle is considerably in adv nee of the other, particularly in the early stages. T s is very plainly brought out in text figure 10, h. As these two bundles, which comprise the leaf tr ce, pass from the stele they consist of mesarch pri ary xylem and a considerable amount of secondary xyl m.

In the earlier stages the secondary xylem is obviously restricted to the abaxial position. However, as the trace emerges from the wood, secondary xylem likewise appears on the adaxial side, so that the bundleS' have a radial arrangement similar to that which might be expected in a small branch, though for obvious reasons the view that they represent such a branch is untenable. The general appearance of these bundles is shown in plate 33, figures 5 and 6. It is clear th~t the centrally located primary xylem is mesarch. However, the protoxylem groups are several, in anticipation of further division of the bundles. These divisions may take place before the strands emerge from the secondary wood. The long axis of the primary wood is tangential.
The two bilndles retain their concentric structure for some distance as they ascend and gradually pass out into the cortex. Their course is only a slight departure from that of the parent axis, as is indicated in text figure 10, c and d. They gradually become more and more tangentially flattened, however, and after they pass into the cortex the secondary xylem is lost, first on the abaxial and finally on the adaxial side. At the same time, the expanse of primary xylem increases. The tissues that are interpreted as phloem thin in the same manner, but a narrow zone is retained on the inner side and a somewhat broader one on the out~r. Tangential elongation of the metaxylem continues with the development of several protoxylem groups. These stages are illustrated in text figure 10, <i and e, and in plate 31, figures 1 and 3.
Leaf base.-In the later stages in the development of the leaf trace there are seen numerous divisions of the original bundles, an indeterminate number of smaller ·ones resulting (text fig. 10, f; pl. 33, fig. 3). The structure of these divisions is mesarch; the phloe~, though thickest on t:P,e abaxial surface, appears to be present on the adaxial surface also.
These bundles retain their orientation with the long sectional axis tangential, as is clearly brought out in text figure 10, f. Unfortunately, later stages than this have not been observed in the material at hand, so it is impossible to determine accurately the nature of the actual petiole. Some suggestion of the structure that might be expected is found in the organ described by Scott and Jeffrey 17 a$ Calamopteris hippocrepis a~d simila1· ones frmn Thuringia referred to C. debilis Unger.18 These ~ave been interpreted as the petioles of some forms allied to Calamopitys but as yet unknown.

The several species· referred to the genus Calamopitys fall naturally into two groups, which have been designated Eu-Calamopitys 19 and Eristophyton.20 These genera or subgenera, as they are variously regarded, have been briefly contrasted above. Though differing somewhat in the structure of the primary wood, and more decidedly in the structure of the secondary wood, one feature in common is the originally monarch condition of the leaf trace. ·This has, in fact, been consider.ed by some investigators a character of generic v:alue. Clearly any tendency toward diarchy is a distinct advance of cardinal importance.
·It has been shown that Diichnia kentuckiensis in the internodal regions shows anatorical features which unite it closely with Eu-Calamopitys. Minor differences exist, but they are of no more th&n specific worth. In the vicinity of the nodes, however, it becomes at once apparent that the stem departs widely from the definition of Calamopitys~ The ~~af traces are clearly double, the two bundl~s departrng from adjacent angles of the five-rayed pith. Furthermore, the leaf base does not appear to conform closely with Kalymma, the known petiole of other species of Oalamopitys in which that organ has been found attached. Instead it more nea,:Hy resernbles Calamopteris. ·· These departures from the morph0logic features typical of Calamopitys, to which Diichnia kentuckiensis shows the closest affinities, can be interpreted as a distinct and important advance. The question of the degree of separation from Eu-Calamopitys therefore

pointed out that in the first of these the leaf trace passes through the wood as - a single bundle and divides only after it has reached the cortex. In 0. americana the strand of xylem divides as it passes through . the secondary wood, the two bundies being quite distinct by the time the cortex is reached.
It is not out of place at this point to mention the exactly parallel case found in the family -Lyginopterideae, genus Heterangium. In Heterangium grievii, from Pettycur, Scotland, the leaf trac·e is at first monarch, but the protoxylem divides it1~6 two after leaving the stele. Division of the bunille does not take place, however, until the vicinity o{ the rachis is reached. In certain other species segregated by Scott in Eu-Heterangium there is a somewhat earlier division of the trace, but it remains primitively monarch. In the other segregate, Polyangium, the leaf trace is double _'where it leaves the stele and undergoes numerous divisions while in the cortex.22
The situation which has just beeli outUned in Heterangium is exactly analgous to tha't in the Calamopityeae, where Diichnia kentuckiens.is ~hows a double leaf trace and apparently occupies the same position relative to Eu-Oalamopitys that· P6lyangium
occupies relative to Eu-Heterangium. Another feature which Diichnia kent'l_fckiensis ex-
hibits and which is suggestive of anatomical advance over most species of Eu-Calamopitys is the tinusually slight amount of primary xylem grouped in v~ry discrete bundles. Calamopitys americaniL and 0. annularis are characterized by nearly or qu~ro contin-

CONCLUSIONS

The observations tha~ have been made on Di chnia kentuckiensis may be summarized as follows:
1. Diichnia kentuckiensis is a stem from th late Devonian strata of Kentucky presenting nu erous

features which ally it with species grouped in Eu-
Oalamopitys by Scott. 2. The double leaf trace, which is a conspicuous
feature of the plant, is a structure that renders Diichnia kentuckiensis distinct from any previously described
form. 3·. The lea( trace exhibits characters which suggest
that Oalamopteris may have been the petiole. 4. On the basis of the diarch traces a new genus,
Diichnia, is proposed for stems conforming to Diichnia kentuckiensis. The definition of Eu-Oalamopitys describes the leaf trace ~s sjngle at the point of origin.
5. The guarded opinion is expressed that through diarchy and reduction of primary xylem Diichnia kentuckiensis shows ' distinct advances over the related species of Oal(fmopitys (Eu-Oalamopitys).
