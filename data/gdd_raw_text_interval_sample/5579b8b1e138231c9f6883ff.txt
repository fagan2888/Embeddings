GEOLOGY AND GKOUND-WATEB EESOUBCES OF ATASCOSA AND FEIO COUNTIES, TEXAS
By JOHN T. LONSDALE
ABSTRACT
Atascosa and Frio Counties are in southwestern Texas and form a part of the Winter Garden district. The purpose of the investigation here recorded was to determine the source, quantity, and quality of the ground water used for irrigation and other purposes in the area.
The rock formations exposed are of Tertiary and Quaternary age and dip toward the east or southeast at a greater angle than the slope of the land surface, resulting in northeastward-trending belts of the outcropping formations. This general structure is modified by a large syncline in the western part of the area and by smaller anticlines and faults in other parts. These, however, do not affect greatly the movement of ground water. In order from oldest to youngest the exposed formations are the Indio formation (800 feet thick), of Wilcox age; the Carrizo sand (425 feet), the basal or Bigford member of the Mount Selman formation (0-500 feet), the post-Bigford beds of the Mount Selman formation (700 feet), the Cook Mountain formation (600 feet), and the Yegua formation (500 feet), all of Claiborne age; the Jackson formation (500 feet); the Catahoula tuff (600 feet), of Miocene age; the Goliad sand (20 feet), of Pliocene (?) age; and the Leona formation (75 feet), of Pleistocene age.
The chief water-bearing formations in the area are the Carrizo sand, the Mount Selman formation, and the Cook Mountain formation. The Carrizo sand crops out in the northern part of the area and furnishes shallow wells in the outcrop area and deeper flowing and nonflowing wells south and southeast of the outcrop. Water from this formation is of good quality and is used for irrigation near Pearsail, in Frio County, and Poteet, in Atascosa County. Maps accompanying the report show 'the outcrop of the sandstone, depths to the sandstone south and southeast of the outcrop, heights to which the water will rise, and the area in which flowing wells can be obtained.
The Mount Selman and Cook Mountain formations consist of discontinuous beds of sandstone, clay, shale, and lignite. The formations are important sources of water for domestic use and to some extent for irrigation. The waters are of variable quality, some being highly mineralized, and vary also in quantity. Water from the Mount Selman formation is used for irrigation near Pearsall and in eastern Atascosa County, and flowing wells are obtained in this formation east of Pearsall and near Pleasanton. The Cook Mountain formation yields water for irrigation near Dilley and supplies flowing wells in southeastern Frio County and southwestern Atascosa County near Hindes. The other formations of the area yield smaller amounts of water for domestic use and stock. These waters also are of variable quality, many being highly mineralized.
The investigation showed that a considerable amount of water from flowing wells is being wasted. If this water were conserved considerable additional irrigation could be carried on. Measurements of the water level in wells from the Carrizo sand (still being continued) lead to the tentative conclusion that the 'safe yield from this formation has not been exceeded.

INTRODUCTION
PURPOSE OF INVESTIGATION
This report covers the results of an investigation in Atascosa and Frio Counties, Tex., which was begun in 1929 under the direction of the Engineering Experiment Station of the Agricultural and Mechanical College of Texas at the joint request of the officials of the Missouri Pacific Kailroad and of residents in the area. Early in 1930 an arrangement was made to incorporate the investigation into the general program of ground-water investigations which is being carried out by the State Board of Water Engineers through cooperation with the United States Geological Survey and which covers several adjacent or nearby counties, including Dimmit, Zavala, Medina, Uvalder Duval, and Webb. This report, therefore, represents the results of a cooperative project between the Engineering Experiment Station, the Texas Board of Water Engineers, and the United States Geological Survey. The investigation was undertaken for the purpose of determining the resources of ground water in the area with special reference to the supply available for irrigation. The field work occupied June, July, and August in both 1929 and 1930, a part of December in 1931, and a part of June in 1932. During the season of 1929 an office was maintained at Pearsall, and in 1930 offices were maintained at both Pearsall and Jourdanton. During the season of 1930 the writer wa& ably assisted by M. T. Halbouty.
ACKNOWLEDGMENTS
The writer is indebted to many persons who contributed information and assistance in the field and assisted in the preparation of this report. Mr. W. B. Cook, of the Missouri Pacific Railroad, and hi& associates cooperated by supplying engineering and agricultural data. Mr. N. H. Hunt and Mr. L. F. Merl, secretaries respectively of the Pearsall and Dilley Chambers of Commerce, contributed data concerning wells and extended many courtesies. Well logs were supplied by Mr. W. D. Morrison, of Dilley; Mr. C. S. Young, of Jourdanton; Mr. F. M. Getzendaner and Mr. L. F. McCollum, of the Humble Oil & Refining Co.; and Mr. J. M. Dawson, of the Gulf Production Co. Mr. Getzendaner also gave freely of his store of geologic information relating to the area. Messrs. A. R. Denison and L. W. Clark, of the Amerada Petroleum Corporation,, supplied information concerning Cook Mountain contacts in Frio County and oil wells drilled by the company. Miss Julia Gardner, of the United States Geological Survey, identified fossils collected by the writer and helped him to map geologic boundaries in parts of the area. Mr. W. N. White, of the Geological Survey, who is in charge of the ground-water investigation in Texas, spent several days in the field with the writer and

data in the files of the United States Geological Survey collected by Messrs. Alexander Deussen and S. S. Nye. The investigation was made under the general direction of Mr. O. E. Meinzer, geologist in charge of the division of ground water in the Geological Survey.
LOCATION OF AREA
Atascosa and Frio Counties are in southwestern Texas (see fig. 1) and comprise a part of the area that is commonly called the Winter Garden district, the boundaries of which are rather loosely defined. Atascosa County has an area of 1,350 square miles and Frio County

4 GROUND WATER OF ATASCOSA AND FRIO COUNTIES, TEX.
1,124 square miles. The principal towns are Poteet, Pleasanton, North Pleasanton, Jourdanton, Lytle, Christine, and Campbellton, in Atascosa County; and Moore, Pearsall, Derby, Melon, Dilley, and Bigfoot, in Frio County.
TOPOGRAPHY AND DRAINAGE
Atascosa and Frio Counties are within the Western Gulf section of the Coastal Plain, which in this part of Texas extends from the Edwards Plateau, on the north and northwest, to the Gulf of Mexico, on the south and southeast. The general pattern of the surface is that of a uniform southeastward slope, somewhat dissected by southeastward-flowing streams. Thus Lytle, in the northwestern part of Atascosa County, has an altitude of about 730 feet above sea level, and Campbellton, in the southern part of the same county, has an altitude of only about 250 feet. In some parts the surface forms a true plain with very little relief, but in general the interstream areas are belts of relatively high land that have a southeasterly trend. In some places the more resistant beds have formed escarpments that face west or north. The greatest relief is in the northern part of the area, especially in northwestern Frio County, where the outcropping rocks contain beds of variable hardness and the streams have dissected the once uniform upland into prominent hills and valleys.
The principal streams of the area are the Frio, Atascosa, and Leona Rivers and San Miguel Creek. Minor streams of. some importance are Hondo, Seco, Lagunillas, Siestadero, and Turkey Creeks. All these streams are intermittent. Floods occur during and immediately after heavy rains, but these floods subside in a few hours or at the most in a few days, and during the greater part of the time the streams either are dry or contain disconnected pools which dwindle during protracted periods of drought until little or no water remains. The channels of the Frio River in the region below Derby and of the Atascosa River below Poteet contain water nearly all the year. This is partly due to the inflow of waste water from artesian wells, that are allowed to flow continually.
The amount of standing water in the stream channels during dry times is related to the character of the underlying rocks. In sandstone areas the stream channels are usually completely dry at such times, but in shale areas they frequently contain pools of water for long periods. This difference gives a clue as to the source of some of the ground water in the sandstone formations of the area.
The larger streams are bordered by belts of alluvium, but these are narrow and poorly defined except along the Frio and Atascosa Rivers and San Miguel Creek in the southern part of the area. The

alluvial deposits do not enter into the ground-water problems of the district.
VEGETATION
The native vegetation reflects to a degree the semiarid subtropical character of the climate. Nearly everywhere the uncultivated areas are covered with a growth of varying density of scrub trees or chaparral. The trees consist dominantly of mesquite in the western part of the area and of mesquite and scrub oak in the eastern part. The chaparral consists chiefly of black brush, catclaw, juahillo (wah-ee'yo), scrub mesquite, and prickly pear and other types of cactus. Near the streams are found trees of considerable size, such as the pecan, cypress, and live oak. Oaks of fairly large size also occur on the divides between the streams in the eastern part of the area. A variety of grasses flourish in open spaces among the trees and chaparral.

TRANSPORTATION
The area is crossed by branch lines of the Missouri Pacific Railroad. The International-Great Northern Railroad passes in a north-south, direction through the northwestern part of Atascosa County and the central part of Frio County. Moore, Pearsall, Melon, Derby, and Dilley, in Frio County, are on this line. One branch of the San Antonio, Uvalde & Gulf division of the Missouri Pacific Railroad passes through north-central Atascosa County and another through the southern part of the county, the towns of Leming, Pleasanton, Jourdanton, Dobrowolski, Charlotte, and Hindes being on the firstnamed branch and Coughran, McCoy, and Campbellton on the other. A third line, the San Antonio Southern Railway, passes through Poteet and Jourdanton and terminates at Christine.
Both Atascosa and Frio Counties are provided with good trunk automobile roads. State highway 2, between San Antonio and Laredo, passes through Frio County, following the line of the InternationalGreat Northern Railroad. State highway 85, from Dilley to Eagle Pass, crosses the southwestern part of the county. Highway 9 crosses Atascosa County from north to south through Leming, Pleasanton, and Campbellton, and a short branch of it (highway 97) extends from Pleasanton to Jourdanton. In the northern part of the county the Palo Alto road from San Antonio extends to Poteet.
All the highways converge at San Antonio, which is the supply and market point for tne area. Secondary automobile roads, which are generally graded and open for travel except in very bad weather, connect all parts of the area. It should be noted that dirt roads passing over certain of the clay formations, such as the Yegua, are impassable after heavy rains.

AGRICULTURE
Atascosa and Frio Counties are to some extent in a stage of transition from stock raising to farming. Until within a comparatively few years very little farming was carried on, and practically the entire area in both counties was devoted to cattle raising. Some of the most famous early ranches in Texas were located in this area.
In recent years farming has been on the increase, much of the development having started with the building of the railroads. In most of the area dry farming is practiced. Cotton is raised extensively, and in Atascosa County it is the largest crop, but in Frio County the rainfall in many years is insufficient to mature the cotton. Corn, various sorghums, and other dry-land crops are raised.
Winter truck farming, with irrigation from wells, has become important in the area. Poteet furnishes large amounts of early strawberries and vegetables. Areas around Pearsall and Dilley furnish onions, spinach, tomatoes, and other vegetables. Large tracts still remain and probably will continue to remain as ranch land, but in general farming is being extended. According to the agricultural census of the United States, 37.9 percent of Atascosa County and 54.8 percent of Frio County were in farms in 1925. Below is a table compiled from the 1925 census showing the kinds of crops raised and the acreage devoted to each crop. The table does not include strawberries, because information was not available as to the acreage of that crop.

HISTORY
The history of Atascosa and Frio Counties is an interesting story of the winning of frontier lands from Indians, the .development of ranching, the building of railroads, and finally a gradual change into a combination of ranching and farming. Only a brief summary of this history can be given here.
Venturesome stockmen established themselves in the area in the early fifties. At that time and for 25 years afterward the region was subject to Indian raids, the Frio County area being the more vulnerable because of its greater distance from San Antonio.

MAPS

/

Atascosa County was delimited and organized in 1871. The county seat was first at Novatascosa, but later it was moved to Pleasanton and still later to Jourdanton. Until 1908 the only railroad in the county passed through the extreme northwestern part. In 1908 and 1909 two railroads, the San Antonio, Uvalde & Gulf and the San Antonio Southern, were built into the county, and Jourdanton, Poteet, and Christine were established as stations on them.
The first flowing well at Poteet, in Atascosa County, was drilled in 1904. before the advent of the railroad, and this demonstration of the availability of artesian water had much to do with the initiation of railroad building in the area. By 1910 there were 10 artesian wells, and thereafter several were drilled each year until the period of the World War, when drilling was stopped on account of the high cost of sinking the wells and providing them with pumping equipment. More recently well drilling has been resumed, and there are now more than 50 artesian wells in the Poteet area. The development of truck farming has paralleled the sinking of the artesian wells.
Frio County was also organized in 1871, with the county seat at Frio Town. In 1881 the county seat was moved to Pearsall, then a new town on the International-Great Northern Railroad, which had recently been built through the county. The original courthouse at Frio Town is still intact and is one of the historic landmarks of the region.
The first flowing well in Frio County was drilled near Pearsall in 1905. Since then, deep wells have been drilled from time to time in the Frio Valley area, west and southwest of Pearsall. Most of these wells flow and furnish water for irrigation of considerable extent.
Irrigation with water pumped from shallow wells was started in the Pearsall area in 1905, and the development reached its height about 1923. Pump-well irrigation was begun in the vicinity of Dilley about 1925 and has since gradually developed.
MAPS
Two maps accompany this report. Plate 1 shows the areal geology, the original and present areas of artesian flow, and the location of record wells and of lands irrigated with water from wells. Plate 2 shows the depths to the top of the Carrizo sand and the height above sea level to which water from the Carrizo sand would rise in 1930. The map of Frio County used as a base for showing the geologic and hydrologic data was .traced from a soil map of the county prepared by M. W. Beck, of the United States Department of Agriculture, and made available through the courtesy of Mr. A. B. Conner, director of the Texas Agricultural Experiment Station. The base map of Atascosa County was prepared by M. T. Halbouty, by compilation of

8 GROUND WATER OF ATASCOSA AND FRIO COUNTIES, TEX.
data from existing county and land maps and by a plane-table traverse which covered about one-third of the county.
CLIMATE
Texas is remarkable for its great variety of climate. The extreme eastern part of the State has an average annual rainfall of more than 45 inches. The precipitation decreases gradually from east to west, the annual average being less than 30 inches at San Antonio and less than 20 inches at Eagle Pass. Atascosa County on the average receives 25 to 30 inches annually as compared with 20 to 25 inches in Frio County.
There is a considerable range in temperature in the two counties. Summer temperatures are frequently higher than 100° and during the winter there is generally at least one killing frost. During the period of record the growing season has varied from 220 to 298 days. Observations made intermittently since 1908 record a minimum temperature of 13°.
In most years there is some rain every month. The heaviest precipitation usually occurs in April, May, and the early part of June and in September and October. February is also a wet month, especially in Frio County. August is the driest month. There is a tendency for the precipitation to be concentrated in heavy rains, which frequently cause floods. In many years there is a decided shortage of rainfall during the summer, especially in July and August. Crops therefore must be specially adapted to dry farming or must be irrigated.
Tables showing available records of rainfall and dates of the first killing frost in the fall and the last killing frost in the spring in the two counties, and of rainfall at Kunge, in Karnes County, are given below, from reports of the United States Weather Bureau.

GENERAL GEOLOGY

The rock formations exposed in Atascosa and Frio Counties are of Tertiary and Quaternary age, but Upper Cretaceous and Lower Cretaceous formations have been encountered in a considerable number of deep wells drilled for oil in the central and northern parts of the area, and they doubtless everywhere underlie the exposed formations. There are many problems of stratigraphy and correlation in the area, but most of them are not within the scope of this report. Plate 1 shows the outcrops of the formations except deposits of Pliocene (?) and Quaternary age. The geologic table on page 18 shows the relations and characteristics of the several formations present.
The information concerning the unexposed formations is based on their character as observed at their outcrops north of Frio and Atascosa Counties and on data obtained from the deep wells in these counties. The wells usually pass through Tertiary and Upper Cretaceous formations and end in the Lower Cretaceous a short distance below the top of the Edwards limestone. No commercial production of oil has yet been found in either of these counties except in the Somerset field, which extends from the vicinity of Somerset, in Bexar County, into the northern part of Atascosa County.
The unexposed formations are practically unavailable for water supply, because they are encountered at depths that are too great for economical development. Hence no attempt is made here to give detailed descriptions or correlations of these formations. A section which is probably more or less typical of the entire area is shown in the log of the North & Walton No. 1 C. C. Tribble well near Bigfoot, in the northeastern part of Frio County, which reached a depth of 3,560 feet. The correlation of the formations encountered in this well is given below. It should be understood that these formations will be encountered at greater depths to the south and southeast and that they may change in lithologic character and thickness. South of the latitude of Pleasanton no oil-test well has penetrated to the bottom of the Tertiary system in either of these counties. Southeast

The general geologic structure of the area is comparatively simple. The most prominent feature is a general gulfward dip of the formations at a greater angle than the slope of the land surface. It is to this structural feature that the presence of artesian water is due. " Frio County, however, lies on the northeast edge of a regional syncline, the axis of which extends northwestward and passes near Gardendale, in La Salle County, and La Pryor, in Zavala County. The strata in the western part of Frio County are affected by this syncline and by an anticline or nose superimposed upon the northeast flank of the syncline. The axis of the anticline is approximately parallel to the course of the Leona River. Reverse dips and outliers of Cook Mountain strata northeast of the Leona River are due to the presence of this anticline or nose. In the northwestern part of Atascosa County the structure that has produced the Somerset oil field is revealed in a considerable fault affecting the strata of the Indio and Carrizo formations. In southeastern Atascosa County an anticline of some size may be present northeast of Campbellton and is indicated on the geologic map. The strata affected are those of the Yegua and Jackson formations.
Small faults have been encountered in northwestern Frio County and were mapped by A. N. Sayre. Minute faults were also found in
1 Since the completion of the field work the Amerada Petroleum Corporation has drilled several deep wells southwest of Pearsall to test the anticlinal structure mentioned on p. 136. The deepest of the wells (Halff & Oppenheimer 2) reached a total depth of 10,050 feet. The depths to the tops of various formations were reported by the geologists of the company to be Carrizo sand 1,260 feet, Indio formation 1,500 feet, Midway group 2,620 feet, Navarro group 3,130 feet, Taylor marl 4,850 feet, Austin chalk 5,200 feet, Buda limestone 5,710 feet, Del Rio clay 5,810 feet, Georgetown limestone 5,900 feet, Edwards limestone 5,990 feet, Qlen Eose limestone 6,791 feet, and Trinity group 9,771 feet. All the wells yielded small amounts of oil and gae from the Edwards limestone, and the well mentioned above was completed as an oil well with production from the Navarro group.

northeastern Frio County, north of Bigfoot, and in Atascosa Countyr east of Lytle, northwest of Leming, and northwest of Jourdanton. None of the faults are of sufficient magnitude to affect greatly the occurrence or movement of the ground water.
RELATION OF THE GEOLOGY TO THE GROUND-WATER CONDITIONS
SOURCE AND DISPOSAL OF THE GROUND WATER
The fundamental principles governing the occurrence and movement of ground water have been set forth in detail by Meinzer. 1* Only essential statements will be made here, and the reader is referred to Meinzer's reports for a more detailed discussion.
The ground water is derived chiefly from water that falls as rain or snow. A part of this water runs off directly in streams to the sea, a part evaporates, a part is consumed by the plants, and a part sinks to the ground-water table and enters the zone of saturation. Most of the water in the zone of saturation is eventually returned to the surface through springs or wells or is discharged by plants or through evaporation from the soil when it approaches the surface. Some water, however, percolates directly into the sea. The water table differs in altitude from place to place and fluctuates as a result of variations in rainfall, evaporation, and other climatic conditions.
The porous rocks below the water table are as a rule saturated witn water and yield water to wells sunk into them wherever the rocks are of such a texture that the water is free to move into the wells. In the more permeable rocks, such as many of the sandstones and gravel, the water is free to move under the influence of gravity, but in less permeable rocks, such as shales and fine-grained sandstones, molecular attraction tends to retard movement of the water.
GENERAL ARTESIAN CONDITIONS
The conditions governing artesian water are discussed in numerous reports of the United States Geological Survey 2 and State geological surveys and in many textbooks of geology. If a permeable stratum in an inclined position, lying between relatively impervious or watertight strata, receives water from rainfall or stream flow at its outcrop, the water entering it will move under the influence of gravity down the dip of the stratum and will tend to accumulate under hydro-

static pressure. The general conditions governing artesian water are shown in figures 2, 3, and 4. Flowing wells may be obtained where the pressure is sufficient to raise the water to the surface. Whether flowing wells can be obtained in any given locality that is underlain by an artesian stratum will depend on the difference in altitude, and the horizontal distance between that locality and the outcrop area, and also on the effectiveness of the confining beds.
In an artesian system, in general, the source of water is that entering at the outcrop of the permeable formation. The artesian system loses water through springs or other natural discharge and through wells sunk to the permeable formation. If the amount of water lost

from the artesian system in any period exceeds the recharge during the same period the head will become lower. If too many wells are sunk the head may be lowered so much that not only will the wells cease to overflow but the water will have to be raised by pumping from so great a depth that the cost of pumping may become excessive. Thus there is a limit to the economical development of any artesian system. This limit is approached or may already be exceeded if the water levels in wells become lower and lower from year to year. As overdevelopment of this kind will affect unfavorably all who use water from the artesian system, it is a subject in which all users of artesian water should be interested.

16 GROUND WATER OF ATASCOSA AND FRIO COUNTIES, TEX.
ARTESIAN CONDITIONS IN ATASCOSA AND FRIO COUNTIES
The structure of the rocks in Atascosa and Frio Counties is favorable for the occurrence of artesian water. The formations are composed largely of permeable sandstones interbedded with relatively impermeable clays and shales. Except in localities where there are notable folds or faults, the rocks dip to the south or southeast, which is also the general direction in which the land surface slopes. However, the dip is nearly everywhere steeper than the surface slope,, and therefore successively younger formations are encountered in crossing the area from north to south or from northwest to southeast. Each formation has an outcrop area from which it extends toward the south or southeast, below the younger formations, to progressively greater depths below the surface. (See pi. 1.) Thus the formations that appear at the surface in the northern part of the area shown on the map occur at depths of several thousand feet in the southeastern part the Carrizo sand, for example, reaching a depth of more than? 4,000 feet near Campbellton.
The Carrizo sand is the most productive artesian aquifer in the area, but certain sand members of the Mount Selman and CookMountain formations also furnish artesian water. The Carrizo sand possesses fairly uniform characteristics over wide areas, and the Carrizo artesian basin can therefore be accurately outlined and described. The Mount Selman and Cook Mountain formations vary considerably in lithology and stratigraphy from place to place, and the aquifers in them cannot be as accurately described as that of the Carrizo.
GEOLOGIC FORMATIONS AND THEIR WATER-BEARING PROPERTIES
A generalized section of the geologic formations that underlie thi& area is given in the accompanying table. The formations are listed in the order in which they lie beneath the surface, each successive formation being older than the one above it.

INDIO FORMATIONS
Areal extent. The Indio formation crops out in a small area in the vicinity of Lytle, in northwestern Atascosa County, and in the banks of the Frio River near the Hiler ranch, in northwestern Frio County (pi. 1). Only the beds in the upper part of the formation are exposed in these counties, the main outcrop area being to the north, in Medina and Bexar Counties. The formation lies unconformably beneath the Carrizo sand.
Lithology. The Indio displays the variations in lithology that are to be expected in rocks that are dominantly nonmarine. Thin-bedded sand and sandstone, clay, laminated carbonaceous shale, and lignite are characteristic of the formation. One fairly persistent sand member about 50 feet thick occurs in the lower part of the formation and crops out in Medina County. Both calcareous and siliceous concretions are common. Many of them are elongated or biscuit-shaped, and some of them reach dimensions of several feet. Some of the sandstone beds are locally indurated to quartzite. The clays are not uncommonly gypsiferous, and in many places the thin laminated shales and sands show a yellow coating of copiapite,4 a sulphate of iron. Photographs of exposures of the upper part of the formation are shown in plate 3, A and B.
Thickness and dip. The formation in Frio County is about 900 feet thick, as shown by the log of the Tribble well (no. 26, pi. 1; see p. 13), and it probably has about the same thickness in Atascosa County. The dip is variable, and there is no satisfactory means of determining it accurately. In northwestern Atascosa County dips of several degrees have been observed, but these are abnormal and related to the structure of the Somerset oil field. Well records indicate that the dip in the northern half of Atascosa County is about 110 feet to the mile. In the southeastern part of the county, however, the records of deep wells seem to indicate a somewhat greater dip. In western Atascosa County and in Frio County the dip is probably about 85 feet to the mile.
Fossil plants are abundant in the Indio formation. Marine fossils are not common but have been found in cuttings from wells in tha formation in Dimmit County and in surface exposures in Bexar and Wilson Counties.
Topography and vegetation. The topography of the outcrop area of the formation is varied, and the relief is greater than that of the outcrop areas of many of the other Eocene formations in this part of

Texas. As the formation is generally sandy with harder ledges intercalated, a rolling hilly topography has developed in places. The sandy areas of the Indio outcrop commonly support a growth of oak and other trees, but the shale areas are usually covered with chaparral.
Sections. The best surface exposures of Indio strata in Atascosa County are found southeast of Lytle, in the banks of the Atascosa River. Sections in the lignite mines in Medina County near Lytle were recorded by Dumble and are still available. These mines have been closed for many years. Other mine sections have been supplied by mine owners. A number of sections of the Indio from mines and surface exposures are given below:

Water supply. In the northern part of the area the Indio formation underlies the surface at depths that can readily be reached by wells. There are, however, only a few records of such wells available. According to A. N. Sayre, who has made an investigation of the geology and ground-water resources of Uvalde and Medina Counties, all wells in the Indio of which records were obtained in southeastern Medina County yield, small quantities of water, some of which is highly mineralized.

CABBIZO SAND 7
Areal extent. The Carrizo sand crops out in the northern parts of Atascosa and Frio Counties and the southern part of Medina County. The outcrop area increases in width from west to east. In northwestern Frio County and southwestern Medina County it is about 4 miles wide, and in northern Atascosa County about 6 to 8 miles wide (pi. 1). The formation is unconformable on the Indio formation below.
Lithology and petrography. The Carrizo sand consists almost entirely of sand but contains minor amounts of clay and lignite. The sands are on the average coarser and purer than those of any other formation in this area. The formation is generally salmon-pink, brickred, or brown where exposed in road cuts or other openings, but it may be uncolored in fresh exposures in sand pits and is generally bleached to a yellow or white in the top soil. Usually the sand is poorly cemented, with little or no matrix, and most specimens of the formation can be pulverized between the fingers. In Atascosa and Frio Counties no one portion of the formation is persistently coarser than another. Thus near the George Blackaller ranch house, in northern Frio County, the sand at the top of the formation is very coarse, but the same is true of the sand in the basal parts of the formation in other localities. Cross-bedding is highly developed in the formation. (See pis. 4, A, and 5, A.)
The sand is in general, only slightly micaceous, but nearly every specimen will yield a small amount of mica. The mica flakes are larger than those found in other Eocene formations and seem to be more abundant in Atascosa County than in Frio County. In contrast with many of the other Eocene sands the Carrizo sand is not gypsiferous nor calcareous and contains only small amounts of iron-bearing minerals. Sand from wells in the Carrizo is usually a nearly colorless sparkling aggregate of various-sized quartz grains, at once distinctive and of an attractive appearance.

Clay is present in the formation either as thin lenticular beds or as nodular lumps surrounded by sandstone. The shale lenses are seldom seen at the surface but are recorded in well records and seen in well samples. The clay lumps can be seen in every shallow pit in the Carrizo sand in Atascosa and Frio Counties. They vary from the size of a pea up to 1 foot in diameter and consist of lightgray plastic clay or sandy clay. Much of this material is bentonitic, and it is possible that the clay lumps were originally of volcanic origin. Lignite in the Carrizo has been reported from a few oil and water wells.
The Carrizo sand has been considered nonmarine. It is composed of wind-blown sand and apparently represents a fossil sand-dune area of remarkable persistence and uniformity. The shale beds are usually nonmarine and represent lagoon or lake deposits.
Petrographic analyses of Carrizo sands are given in the table below. The samples analyzed were selected to show the variations in mechanical composition. Nos. 9 to 13 represent the very coarse sand found at a number of localities: the others represent finergrained sands.

Thickness and dip. The Carrizo sand ranges in thickness from about 175 to 400 feet, according to well records, which, however, may not have been correlated with complete accuracy. The average thickness as estimated from surface exposures is about 325 feet. The dip is about 125 feet to the mile in southeastern Atascosa County, about 90 feet to the mile in central Frio County, and about 70 feet to the mile in western Frio County.
Topography and vegetation. The topography developed on the Carrizo sand is distinctive. The relief is moderately high, and the general aspect is rolling. Streams are not common, and badland features result from rains. Small sand dunes occur in some localities. The excessively sandy character of parts of the outcrop area is shown in plate 5, A. The vegetation also is distinctive. It varies somewhat from eastern Atascosa County to western Frio County because of a material difference in the amount of rainfall. In Atascosa County and eastern Frio County live oak grows on the outcrop to the exclusion of other species except for a few mesquite and some low brush. Some hint of this type of vegetation is given in the background of plate 4, J5. Between the trees the sandy soil supports a sparse growth of brush and grasses. In western Frio County the rainfall is materially lesa than in Atascosa County. Live oaks are found only near water, and the mesquite with some chaparral is dominant. The stand, however, is not dense but scattering. Consequently the area has an open parklike appearance, which is quite in contrast to that of the heavily brush-covered lands on adjacent formations. (See pi. 4, A.}
Sections. Thick exposed sections of the Carrizo sand are rare,, owing to the ease with which the formation is eroded. Exposures a few feet thick are found on the Atascosa River, in numerous sand pits, in road cuts, and along the Frio River. The best section noted isexposed in the bank of the Frio River 1 mile above the road crossing at the Woodward ranch (pi. 4, J5), where 20 to 30 feet of massive cross-bedded coarse sand unconformably overlies thinner-bedded sand containing some shale and lignitic material. These beds belong to the lower part of the formation. Two sections which also represent exposures in the lower part of the formation are given below. The character of the fonnation as revealed in wells is shown in the welL logs on pages 81-87.

Many of the pits opened for road materials in Atascosa and Frio Counties afford excellent exposures of the Carrizo. The pits are shallow, as only the weathered surface sand is removed, the more firmly cemented, unweathered rock being left undisturbed. A pit on the Palo Alto road 2 miles south of the railroad crossing near Tarbutton, Atascosa County, is typical. Here a surface 100 by 100 feet is exposed in which the vertical range is not more than 18 inches. The predominating rock is a cross-bedded coarse salmon-pink sand containing irregular lumplike masses of light blue-gray sandy clay and interbedded with small amounts of flaggy to shaly sandstone. The coarse sand is loosely cemented. It shows small areas in which the quartz grains reach a maximum size of 4 millimeters, and it contains mica hi large flakes. Thin layers of fine-grained light-gray sandstone are also exposed.
Well logs. Logs of several wells that penetrate the Carrizb sand are given in the table on pages 81-87. Some of these logs are incomplete, the record of formations encountered below the Carrizo sand being omitted. A few of the logs are briefly discussed below.

162. This well is in northwestern Atascosa County 4 miles west of Rossville. It was drilled near the south boundary of the outcrop of the Carrizo sand and passed completely through it. The Carrizo is represented in the record from 83 to 485 feet, and consists entirely of sand and sandstone of variable degree of coherency. The beds encountered below 485 feet belong to the Indio formation and are composed chiefly of alternating shale and sandstone. The total depth of this well, an oil test, was 4,080 feet.
241. This well is in north-central Atascosa County 1% miles north of Pleasanton. It gives a nearly complete section of the Mount Selman formation, as it was drilled at a point near the top of this formation. The Carrizo sand is shown frpm

26 GROUND WATER OF ATASCOSA AND FRIO COUNTIES, TEX.
1,200 to 1,515 feet. Here also the formation is seen to consist almost entirely of sand.
300. This well is in north-central Atascosa County, 2 miles southeast of Pleasanton, about 4 miles southeast of well 241. The Carrizo sand was encountered at 1,419 to 1,722 feet considerably-deeper than in well 241. The well had a total depth of 1,722 feet. Coal was encountered at the bottom of the well, perhaps in the Indio formation but probably in the Carrizo sand, an occurrence not unknown elsewhere.
107. This well is in southern Frio County, 1% miles southwest of Derby. The first bed encountered in the well below surficial deposits belongs to a horizon estimated as about 100 feet below the top of the Mount Selman formation. The beds penetrated between 1,469 and 1,709 feet presumably belong to the Carrizo sand, and the shale and rock at the bottom of the well, between 1,709 and 1,760 feet may be Indio, but this is not certain. The beds logged above the Carrizo sand probably belong in part to the Bigford member of the Mount Selman formation, but the boundary between the formations is not shown.
26. An oil test well in northeastern Frio County, 6 miles northeast of Moore. This well was carefully drilled, and numerous cores were taken in the course of the drilling. The record is therefore very valuable as a basis for correlation of the many formations encountered. The Carrizo is present from 37 to 212 feet and consists largely of sand with two strata of lignite.
3. This well is in northwestern Frio County, 3 miles north of Frio Town. It was an oil test well and was drilled through the Carrizo sand into lower formations. The Carrizo was found from 65 to 248 feet and consisted largely of sand and sandstone. The well was drilled near the Carrizo-Bigford contact and passed through 65 feet of Bigford strata.
155. This well is in north-central Frio County, 4 miles southeast of Moore. It was drilled to a depth of 1,978 feet in an effort to obtain a flowing well. The beds between 530 and 931 feet, consisting of sand and sandstone, belong to the Carrizo.
22. This well is in north-central Frio County, about 3 miles southwest of Moore and \% miles northwest of well 155 and was an oil test. The Carrizo sand was encountered in it between 498 and 880 feet, and the beds correspond closely in thickness and character with those found in well 155.
The logs on pages 81-87 give some idea of the variations in thickness and character of the Carrizo sand in different parts of the area. The thickness according to the well drillers ranges from 175 to 402 feet. In general the formation thickens down the dip and from west to east along the strike. The formation is composed dominantly of sand but contains thin beds of shale and lignite. Coarse white sands yield water most freely to wells.
Water supply. The Carrizo sand, itself very permeable, is underlain by clay and shales of the Indio formation and overlain by clay of the Mount Selman formation. In the western part of Frio County the basal or Bigford member of the Mount Selman overlies the Carrizo, but farther east the Bigford has not been differentiated and the overlying beds are classed simply as Mount Selman. Partly as a result of this arrangement, water in the Carrizo sand is everywhere under artesian pressure except on the outcrop, and over a wide extent of territory the pressure is sufficient to bring the water to the surface.

The maps show the outcrop of the Carrizo sand, the depths to the sand in localities south of the outcrop, the heights to which the water from the sand will rise, and the areas in which flowing wells can be obtained by drilling into it. Everywhere south or southeast of the outcrop the formation is encountered by wells but at greater and greater depths with increasing distance from the outcrop. The increase in the depth to the sand toward the south and southeast and the altitude above sea level to which water in the Carrizo sand would rise in 1930 are shown on plate 2. From this map it can be seen that the formation dips fairly uniformly away from the outcrop. The boundaries of the areas having the same range in depth are based on well records in which the Carrizo can be identified.
On the putcrop area water is obtained in wells at depths generally slightly more than 100 feet. These wells yield abundant supplies of water for domestic purposes. The water is essentially not under pressure in the outcrop area, because the upper surface of the saturated part of the formation is in permeable sand, where it forms a water table. A list of measured or estimated depths to the Carrizo sand in different parts of the area is given below.

Area of artesian flow. The areas in which flowing wells may be obtained from the Carrizo sand are shown on plate 1. The north boundary of the area follows more or less closely the contours of surface altitude, and in the northern part of the area the flowing-well territory is restricted to the valleys. From plate 2 it is possible to determine for any Ideality both, the approximate depth at which a well will encounter the Carrizo sand and the approximate altitude above sea level to which water in the well will rise.
Chemical character oj the water. The water from the Carrizo sand is the best in quality of all the waters of the area. The total amount of

dissolved solids is generally less than 500 parts per million, except in the water drawn from the deeper wells, in which the total amount is generally less than 600 parts per million. Some of the samples from wells near the outcrop were unusually pure, containing less than 200 parts per million of total dissolved solids. The Carrizo waters generally contain some iron.

MOUNT SELMAN FORMATION 8

0

In this report the Mount Selman formation is described in two sections, one on the basal or Bigford member and the other on the remainder of the formation. In previous reports the Bigford deposits have been treated as a distinct formation and included in the Wiicox group, but because of the accumulating evidence that they are of Claiborne age, they are here treated as a local member of the Mount Selman formation, with which they are included on the geologic map of Texas published in 1932. They are considered by Julia Gardner to be contemporaneous with but not exactly equivalent to the Reklaw of eastern Texas, from which they differ lithologically and with which they are not directly connected.

BIGFORD MEMBER»
General features. The Bigford member of the Mount Selman formation crops out in northern Frio County. Its outcrop area is shown on plate 1 as extending from the west boundary of the county eastward t'o the International-Great Northern Railroad near Moore. Farther east the presence of the member is problematic, but in northeastern Frio County and in northern Atascosa County beds that are similar lithologically to those of the Bigford in other localities crop out and may belong to the member. Getzendaner 10 has stated that the Bigford is present as far east as Bigfoot, in northeastern Frio County. This statement is based on the presence of a sandstone (the Mills bed of Getzendaner), which has been definitely identified by the writer as far east in Frio County as Seco Creek. Somewhat similar sandstones occur in the Mount Selman formation in north-central Frio County, and it is felt that insufficient detailed work has been done to be certain of the correlation of the formations around Bigfoot. Accordingly east of the International-Great Northern Railroad the Bigford member is not differentiated from the rest of the Mount Selman, and statements with regard to water-supply conditions mention only the Mount Selman. The line of separation

between the Bigford member and the rest of the Mount Selman is drawn with difficulty because of similar lithologic character.
Lithology. The Bigford is composed dominantly of dark to buff clays with thin sandstones and thin limestones, a small amount of volcanic ash, and impure lignite. Calcareous concretions are common and form good markers for the lower part of the member. The Mills bed of Getzendaner is an especially distinctive bed of the member in Zavala County and the western part of Frio County. It is unlike other sandstones in the Bigford member, though similar to certain local sandstones in the overlying beds of the Mount Selman. It is a fine-grained noncalcareous, fairly well cemented sandstone, grayish white, but showing pink, lavender, and purplish tints in hand specimens. It carries an abundance of plant remains, both leaves and stems. The stems are usually about a quarter of an inch in diameter and resemble sedges. Good outcrops of this bed are found along the Bigford escarpment in northern Frio County.
Thickness. The thickness of the Bigford member is variable. It is difficult to recognize the member in well records. In western Frio County it is probably 300 feet thick, but it may pinch out toward the east.
Paleontology. Fossils, except plants, are not abundant in the Bigford. Poorly preserved oysters and various mollusks are occasionally found, but no guide fossils for the member have yet been described.
Topography and vegetation. The outcrop area of the upper part of the Bigford member is one of moderate relief, but in that of the basal part the relief is commonly stronger. In the basal part of the section resistant sandstones are present and form northward-facing escarpments. These are especially well developed in northern Frio County on the John J. Little ranch. The vegetation is the common assemblage of chaparral but is usually thicker than that on either the Carrizo or the overlying beds of the Mount Selman formation.
Water supply. The Bigford member does not yield much water to wells, and the water is in general highly mineralized.

POST-BIGFOKD BEDS
Areal extent. The post-Bigford part of the Mount Selman formation crops out in a belt of variable width extending across both Atascosa and Frio Counties. (See pi. 1.) It rests unconformably on either the Bigford member or the Carrizo sand and is conformable beneath the Cook Mountain formation.
Lithology and petrography. The beds are composed of gray, brown, and yellow sandstone, white, yellow, and brown clay, lignite, concretions of limonite and limestone, gypsum, altered volcanic ash, and small amounts of glauconite. The lignite beds are not important

30 GROUND WATER OP ATASCOSA AND FRIO COUNTIES, TEX.
commercially in Atascosa and Frio Counties, though some mining of them has been attempted in the past. In Frio County the beds are divisible into a lower clay member and an upper sand member, but their character changes along the strike, and in Atascosa County they consist largely of alternating sand and clay beds. The sandstones are usually lenticular and are in many places indurated to quartzites. However, east of Pearsall rather persistent beds of sandstone are found in the upper part of the formation. (See pi. 5, B.} Some of the sandstone beds resemble fairly closely the Mills bed of Getzendaner in the Bigford member. These are found 4 miles east of Pearsall on the Charlotte road, near Navarro School in Atascosa County, and at other places. Altered volcanic ash is also present in the lower part of the beds. Exposures of this material are found 4 miles east of Pearsall and east of Leming. Glauconitic beds occur in the lower part and are usually marked by highly ferruginous outcrops and soils. Plate 6, A, shows alternating sandstones and shaly sandstones in the lower part of the beds.

Thickness. The post-Bigford beds vary in thickness along both the strike and the dip. The average thickness as determined from the outcrops in Atascosa and Frio Counties is probably around 700 feet, but a much greater thickness is indicated in wells. At Pearsall the top of the Carrizo is found at a depth of 1,134 feet in wells. Even after allowing for dip and the presence of the Bigford member, there still must be as much as 900 feet of post-Bigford Mount Selman beds in the wells. Even greater thicknesses are shown in records of wells farther down the dip.
Paleontology. Fossils of Claiborne age are sometimes found in the post-Bigford beds of the Mount Selman formation but are not abundant. Deussen u has listed Venericardia planicosta Lamarck, Plejona petrosa Conrad, and Cornulina armigera (Conrad). Trowbridge 12 added to this list Cytherea sp., Protocardia sp., and a number of plant fossils.
Topography and vegetation. The outcrop area exhibits a moderately well developed relief. On clayey parts of the formation the country is rather monotonously level, but on the upper part, which contains resistant sandstones, the topography is marked by numerous isolated hills. These are seen southeast of Pearsall and in much of northwestern Frio County. The vegetation is chaparral not greatly different from that developed on the Bigford member.
Sections. Sections of the post-Bigford part of the Mount Selman formation are given below.

Well logs. The logs of four wells in the Mount Selman formation are given in the table of well logs on pages 81-87 and are briefly discussed below.
The logs of the high school well (no. 64), at Pearsall, and the H. H. Page well (no. 40), \% miles north of Pearsall, illustrate the stratigraphy in the vicinity of Pearsall, where there is considerable irrigation. The greater part of the irrigation wells are about 100 feet deep and encounter water sand at depths ranging from 65 to 85 feet. The water is under small artesian pressure and rises slightly above the top of the water sand. The high school and several other wells have been drilled to depths around 200 feet. Such wells generally failed to find an adequate supply of water at the upper horizon and were carried on down. It appears that the water sand supplying the shallow wells is restricted to a small area and is present as a lens with greatest thickness north and northeast of the town. Wells put down farther east and in localities south of Pearsall, though finding sands at comparatively shallow depths, have not yielded adequate supplies for irrigation.
The Oppenheimer & Lang well (no. 83) is in the valley of San Miguel Creek east of Pearsall. The well was started near the top of the Mount Selman formation. In a total depth of 860 feet 7 water-bearing sands were found, and the 2 lower ones furnished flowing water. Of the upper 330 feet 242 feet was composed of beds of a sandy nature, if not of pure sand.
The C. S. Young well (no. 251) started in the Cook Mountain formation and was drilled nearly to the Carrizo sand. The beds between 338 and 1,428 feet, composed of alternating sandstones and shale or gumbo, have been identified as Mount Selman. Water sands were encountered at depths of 745 to 760, 810 to 820, 931 to 951, 1,113 to 1,155, and 1,188 to 1,210 feet. The well indicates the character of the geologic section around Pleasanton, where there are many artesian wells in the Mount Selman formation ranging in depth from 300 to 850 feet.
Water supply. Usually several water-bearing sandstones are encountered by wells in the post-Bigford part of the Mount Selman

COOK MOUNTAIN FORMATION

35

formation. These sandstones are interbedded with clays, and the water in them is under artesian pressure except in localities where they appear at the surface. As the stratigraphy of the formation is not constant over large areas the artesian strata are not continuous. The upper half of the formation contains more sand than the lower half, and in parts of the area it is an important source of water. Most of the artesian water thus far developed from the Mount Selman comes from the upper part of the formation. Thinner beds in the lower part ordinarily yield artesian water of poorer quality and in smaller amounts. A few wells in Atascosa County, however, yield large flows from the lower part.
Areas of artesian flow. Plate 1 shows the area in which flows can be obtained from wells in the Mount Selman formation. This area is in the south-central and southeastern parts of Frio County and the south-central and southwestern parts of Atascosa County. For much of the southern and southeastern parts of Atascosa County the available data are incomplete, and it is possible to give only a general outline of the artesian area.
Chemical character of the water. The waters in the Mount Selman formation have considerable range in chemical composition. The variations within the formation are in part directly related to the horizon from which the water is drawn and in part to the depth of the wells. Some of the wells are doubtless subject to inflow of water from the overlying Cook Mountain or Yegua formation, and this affects the chemical character of the water. The post-Bigford part of the Mount Selman varies lithologically along both the strike and the dip. The water obtained from the upper sandy beds is generally suitable for domestic use, and some of it is suitable for irrigation. The lower beds contain a relatively larger amount of clay, with alternating thin sand beds. The water from the lower clayey beds is generally of poorer quality, and much of it is not suitable for any use.
The shallow water near Pearsall and in the sandy areas east and south of Pearsall is generally of good quality, containing chloride and sulphate, with relatively small amounts of sodium carbonate and sodium chloride.
COOK MOUNTAIN FORMATION 13
AreaL extent. The Cook Mountain formation crops out in Atascosa and Frio Counties in a belt whose entire width lies within the two counties. The line of contact between the Cook Mountain formation and the underlying Mount Selman formation enters Atascosa County south of Verdi and passes south of Pleasanton, \% miles north of Charlotte, and through the Keystone ranch, in Frio County. It crosses the Frio River southeast of Derby and thence passes westward
11 For original description see Kennedy, William, op. cit., pp. 54-57. Additional descriptions of the formation in southwestern Texas are given by Deussen, Alexander, op. cit., pp. 64-75, and Trowbridge, A. O., op. cit., pp. 104-129.

36 GROUND WATER OF ATASCOSA AND FRIO COUNTIES, TEX.
to the Zavala County line. (See pi. 1.) Collections of fossils from certain localities north of the Leona River in Frio County were identified as Cook Mountain by Julia Gardner. These localities are isolated outliers of the Cook Mountain and are not shown on plate 1. Such exposures are due to an anticline or nose present in this region, and most of them are on its north flank, some of them exhibiting north or reverse dip.13a At a point 3K miles northeast of the Corey ranch about 60 feet of Cook Mountain beds are present with a dip of more than 2° N. This locality is highly fossiliferous. Directly south of the locality along the Leona River typical Mount Selman sand i& exposed. Other Cook Mountain localities north of the Leona include Catarina Hill, Oyster Hill on the Loxton ranch, and the English Hills, in all of which the Cook Mountain strata cap the hills. Cook Mountain rocks are probably present on Berry Creek southwest of the Loxton ranch and on Little Yoledigo Creek southeast of the Taylor ranch. The formation is conformable both above and below.
Lithology and petrography. The formation consists of sandstone, gypsiferous clay, impure limestone, and lignite. Much of the sandstone is glauconitic and contains considerable quantities of cone-incone concretions. The formation varies considerably in lithologic character along the strike. In eastern Atascosa County it consists largely of alternating beds of gypsiferous clay and glauconitic sandstone, with boulders of fossiliferous indurated calcareous sandstone. West of the general region of Pleasanton the lower part of the formation consists largely of glauconitic sandstone, in many places fossiliferous, with only a little clay. The greatest development of the basal glauconitic sandstone is in Frio County, where all of the Cook Mountain area except the southeast corner of the county is underlain by this rock. To the east the area underlain by the basal sandstone becomes progressively narrower until the sandstone is no longer observable near Pleasanton. Its absence east of Pleasanton is probably due to overlap or a gradation of the sandstone into the alternating clay and sandstone section above. In areas underlain by the sandstone brick-red loamy soils are developed, but where clay is the predominant constituent the formation produces black soils.
The contact of the formation with the Mount Selman in western Atascosa County is obscured by large areas of loose sand. Banks Hill, just west of the county boundary, and another area near Tobey are probably outliers of the formation and are not shown on the map.
The sandstones of the formation are generally glauconitic, though some samples are entirely free from glauconite. In some exposures the glauconitic material is calcareous and takes the character of an impure marly limestone. Petrographic analyses of sands from the formation are given below.

Thickness and dip. The thickness of the Cook Mountain formation ranges from 600 to 900 feet; the maximum thickness is found in wells. The beds dip southeastward at an average rate of about 115 feet to the mile.
Paleontology. Fossils are very abundant in the formation. These are found in lenses and ledges of impure glauconitic limestone which are scattered through the formation. Detailed lists of fossils of the formation have been given by both Deussen 14 and Trowbridge 15 and are not repeated here.
Topography and vegetation. The topographic expression of the Cook Mountain outcrop area varies with the lithology. The areas underlain by sandstone are generally rolling and have moderate relief; the less sandy parts of the formation are also rolling but have slight relief. A considerable part of the formation is sandy, and its outcrop area commonly supports open chaparral brush with scattered large live oaks. Mesquites are generally larger than those growing on other formations.
Sections. Many small sections of the Cook Mountain formation are found throughout the area, although, in general, the formation is better exposed in Atascosa County than in Frio County. Sections from three localities in Atascosa County are given below.

A part of the section on the Bluntzer road is shown in plate 6, B. An exposure of clay with calcareous concretions from the middle part of the formation is shown in plate 7, A.
No good sections of the upper part of the formation are exposed in this area. In the Dilley region, southwestern Frio County, many small exposures of the upper part of the formation are found in road cuts and on hills. The predominant rock type is a brick-red sandstone containing weathered glauconite and yielding a reddish sandy-loam soil. Throughout this area thin concretionary limestone beds are also found and are usually fossiliferous. The log of the C. M. Kelley well (p. 84) shows the character of the upper part of the formation as disclosed by well cuttings.
Well logs. Logs of wells in the Cook Mountain formation in parts of the area were obtained, including the log of the C. M. Kelley well, near Hindes, 2,390 feet deep, and logs of three wells 280 to 370 feet deep near Dilley. Unfortunately few logs of wells in the formation are available except in the Dilley area.
The C. M. Kelley well (no. 114) is in extreme southeastern Frio County. It starts near the top of the Cook Mountain formation and penetrates to the Carrizo sand. The Mount Selman contact in this well is believed to be at 965 feet, but its correct location is somewhat problematic. The formation is composed of sand, clay, sandstone, and limestone. The sands penetrated by the well between 373 and 433 feet supply the shallow flowing wells at Hindes, and sands at the same horizon but at greater depths probably supply wells near Christine. The bottom of the formation is not notably sandy, and the most sandy facies of the lower part of the Cook Mountain are found in western Frio County.
The logs of wells near Dilley (nos. 122, 133, and 136) show the character of the Cook Mountain water-bearing sands in western Frio County. According to these and other available logs the sands range from 115 to 344 feet in thickness. It is possible that some of the extreme thicknesses recorded may represent beds that are generally sandy and water-bearing but contain minor amounts of clay or shale. The records indicate quite plainly, however, that there is a thick sand member at the base of the Cook Mountain near Dilley, which thickens to the southeast.
Water supply. The water-bearing sands of the Cook Mountain formation are generally not continuous nor very thick, and in these respects they are comparable with the sands in the Mount Selman formation. The thickest and most persistent sands are in the lower half of the formation, and it is from these sands that most of the water is obtained. The water is usually under some artesian pressure, and a few flowing wells have been obtained in Atascosa County, but in most places the wells do not flow.
Irrigation has been developed with water pumped from wells in this formation in an area around Dilley, in Frio County. The largest pumped wells and the lands irrigated from them, together with flowing wells in the formation in Atascosa County on which reliable data were obtained, are shown on plate 1.

YEGUA FORMATION

41

Chemical character of the water. The water from the Cook Mountain formation is variable in character, but on the whole it is highly mineralized. The lower sandy portions of the formation yield the best water, some of which is suitable for domestic use and for irrigation on sandy soils with good drainage. It is difficult to find suitable water for domestic use in the upper clayey parts of the formation. Much of this water is very high in dissolved solids and is objectionable to the taste.
YEGUA FORMATION'"
Areal eyctent. The Yegua formation crops out in the extreme southeastern part of Frio County and in a belt several miles wide in Atascosa County extending from the vicinity of Hindes, on the southeast, through Christine to McCoy and on to the east boundary of the county. (See pi. 1.) In some previous reports on eastern Texas this formation has been called the fCockfield formation,17 but that name has now been dropped.
Lithology. The formation is composed almost entirely of gray to yellowish or light-brown clay. Some slightly sandy clay, lignite, gypsum, limestone, and limestone concretions are also found. The gypsum is rather uniformly distributed through the clay as small crystals and grains of selenite. Lignite is present in beds that range from thin seams to beds of commercial thickness. The limestone concretions are yellowish and composed of dense compact limestone with a few veins of calcite. Cone-in-cone concretions in minor amounts are also found. The clays as a whole are carbonaceous, giving brown to blackish stains and seams in nearly every exposure.
Thickness and dip. The Yegua formation is variable in thickness. In the outcrop area it is probably not more than 700 feet thick, but the logs of wells indicate that down the dip it is materially thicker. It has an average dip of about 150 feet to the mile.
Paleontology. Fossils are not abundant in the formation, but occasionally large oysters are found.
Topography and vegetation. The outcrop area of the Yegua is one of little relief. The topography is therefore in some contrast to that of the Cook Mountain below and the Jackson above, in which considerable relief is common. Seen from any higher point the country underlain by the Yegua appears as nearly a plain cut by shallow stream valleys. Drainage on the whole is poor, and marshy lands are not uncommon.
The vegetation is less prolific than that of the overlying and underlying formations, though partaking of the same general character.

Oaks are practically absent; mesquite and pricklypear are abundant but do not occur in dense thickets. The soils are generally deep and black, with scattered buff or reddish-buff areas.
Sections. Few exposures of Yegua showing a greater vertical range than a few feet were found. Stream banks and road cuts yield the best exposures, and these indicate that the beds do not vary greatly in character from the bottom of the formation to the top. Sections near the base of the formation along the Pleasanton-Campbellton highway show typical brown gypsiferous clay with yellow concretions and some cone-in-cone structure. Similar exposures are found on the road from Jourdanton to Christine.
The best exposures are found along the Atascosa River for several miles above McCoy. These show only slight variation but are typical of the formation.

This section shows the contact between the Cook Mountain and Yegua. The greensand probably represents the top of the Cook Mountain formation.
The thickest lignite beds are found near the top of the formation. Northwest of Campbellton test pits showed several feet of the material over a considerable area. Just south of the Atascosa County line, near Cross Settlement, south of Christine, 15 feet of lignite is exposed in the bank of San Miguel Creek.
Chemical character of the water. Most of the water from the Yegua formation is so highly mineralized that it is unsuitable for either domestic use or irrigation, though a few wells supply water that can be used. Most of the water is even unsuitable for livestock, as the stock generally refuse to drink it. Throughout the outcrop area of this formation domestic water supplies are obtained by storing rain water in cisterns or metal tanks.

GROUND WATBE OF ATASCOSA AND FKEO COUNTIES, TEX. 43 JACKSON FORMATION "
Areal extent. The Jackson formation appears at the surface only in southeastern and southern Atascosa County. The lower boundary line passes north of Fashing, north of Campbellton, and out of the county near Cross Settlement, in northern McMullen County. (See pi. 1.) None of the larger towns are located on the Jackson, and the area of outcrop is largely ranch country with minor amounts of farm land. The formation lies conformably on the Yegua formation and unconformably beneath the Catahoula tuff, which has overlapped the Frio clay.
Lithology and petrography. The Jackson is composed of sandstone, quartzite, sandy clay, and volcanic ash. Much of the clay is carbonaceous or lignitic and hence chocolate-colored. The sandstone is generally gray to white, but a few beds are darker and weather to reddish soils. Many of the sandstones are thin-bedded. The beds of volcanic ash range from buff to white and are of variable thickness, the maximum being about 15 feet. They are usually partly altered to clay materials. The formation abounds in silicified wood and contains both calcareous and siliceous concretions, some of the former with cone-in-cone structure. Petrographic analyses of Jackson sands are given below.
18 In former reports and maps issued by the U. 8. Geological Survey all beds of Jackson (upper Eocene) age in Texas were included in the Fayette sandstone. It is now recognized that the beds of Jackson age in this State cannot all be appropriately assigned to the Fayette. For this reason the Survey has recently substituted Jackson formation for the beds of Jackson age in Atascosa, Prio, and other counties in southern Texas.

Thickness and dip. In Atascosa County the Jackson formation is about 450 feet thick, with some variation from place to place. The dip averages about 120 feet to the mile, but southeast of Campbellton much higher dips, due to local structural modifications, were observed.
Fossils. The Jackson formation is locally fossiliferous. Many of the platy or flaggy sandstones of the lower part of the formation abound in fossils. The number of species is not great, but these are frequently present in great abundance. No detailed paleontologic studies of these fossils have been published, though Ostrea georgiana Conrad is commonly listed as a characteristic form. Fossil plants are likewise abundant in the formation.1821
Topography and vegetation. The outcrop of resistant sandstone beds in the lower part of the formation is marked by a prominent escarpment or line of hills which is seen south of Campbellton and can be traced across Atascosa County (pi. 7, B). The extreme lower and upper parts of the formation are composed of softer beds, and where these appear at the surface the country is a rather featureless plain. The vegetation on the outcrop does not differ materially from that found on outcrop areas of adjacent formations.
Sections. Excellent sections of the entire Jackson formation are found in southeastern Atascosa County. Some of the sections are given below.

Water supply. The water from the Jackson formation is variable in chemical quality. The sandstone from the lower part of the formation yields considerable quantities of water, some of which is suitable for use, but the higher beds generally yield water that is highly mineralized and is frequently unsuitable for use.

CATAHOULA TUFF lfl

The Catahoula tuff crops out in extreme southeastern Ataseosa County, where it covers an area of about 2 square miles. It consists of creamy-gray volcanic tuff and fine tuffaceous sandstone. The thick-
's In accordance with present usage the term "Catahoula tuff" is applied to the dominantly volcanic series of tuffs, tuffaceous sandstones, and conglomerates overlying the Frio clay in southern Texas.

GROUND WATER OF ATASCOSA AND FRIO COUNTIES, TEX. 47
ness exposed in Atascosa County is not more than 100 feet, and the formation does not enter into the problems of water supply.
The Catahoula lies on the Jackson formation, the Frio clay having been overlapped.
GOLIAD SAND
The Goliad sand in this area is composed largely of gravel and cobbles of various kinds, with some sand and caliche. Outcrops of the formation, all of them only a few feet thick, are found sparingly southwest of Charlotte, in southwestern Atascosa County, and rather abundantly throughout Frio County. All the exposures occur on high interstream areas. The formation is not a source of water supply in Atascosa and Frio Counties and is not shown on plate 1. It is probably of Pliocene age.
LEONA FORMATION
In the valley of the Frio River, in northern Frio County, are terrace materials consisting of buff to gray silt, with minor lenses of sand or gravel, that are believed to belong to the Leona formation, of Pleistocene age. Occasional steep faces show as much as 35 feet of the material. The formation, however, is found in only small areas and is not a source of water supply.
ALLUVIUM
The stream valleys of Atascosa and Frio Counties contain Recent alluvial deposits of sand and silt, which are restricted to very narrow areas and are not of consequence as sources of water.
SANDSTONE DIKES
Two sandstone dikes are known to occur in the area one on the E. J. Pruitt farm, 5 miles west of Charlotte, Atascosa County, on the west side of Lagunillas Creek, and the other 8^ miles east of Pearsall, Frio County, just south of the Pearsall-Charlotte road, on the west side of Black Creek.
The dike in Atascosa County crops out on the surface as a rudely wall-like mass 70 feet long and 30 feet wide with a strike of N. 52° E. It stands about 8 feet above the general land surface. Another outcrop of the same mass occurs 100 yards to the southwest, where the character is the same. The dike is jointed at right angles to the strike. The rock composing the dike is ferruginous medium- to coarse-grained well-cemented sandstone.
The dike in Frio County crops out as a wall 30 to 35 feet wide and 70 feet long. The strike is N. 34° E. The general character of the material is the same as that of the dike in Atascosa County except that the ferruginous sandstone contains numerous rounded cobbles

48 GROUND WATER OF ATASCOSA AND FRIO COUNTIES, TEX.
and pebbles of chert as much as 6 inches in diameter. In parts of the rock these are the major constituents, and the rock is therefore a conglomerate. These cobbles are identical with those of the Goliad formation and probably have come from the same source. It is also likely that the materials for the dike were supplied from the erosion of Goliad gravel.
So far as can be told from the exposures near the dikes, they were not formed after faulting had opened crevices in the surface of the earth. It seems evident from the nature of the dikes that they were formed by the filling of crevices or cracks with detrital material. The structural details, however, are not available.
IRRIGATION FROM WELLS
IRRIGATION FROM WELLS IN CARRIZO SAND
General conditions. Wells in the Carrizo sand yield abundant supplies of water for irrigation and for municipal and domestic use. The intensive development for irrigation is restricted mainly to relatively small tracts in the Frio Valley, in Frio County, and in the general locality of Poteet and Pleasanton, in Atascosa County (pi. 1). A few wells in the Carrizo sand in other parts of the area are also used for irrigation.
Frio Valley area. Irrigation from wells in the Carrizo sand in Frio County has thus far been confined for the most part to relatively small tracts southwest of Pearsall. (See pi. 1.) The first Carrizo sand well in this area was drilled in 1905 by Halff & Oppenheimer and was a flowing well. Since that time 12 additional wells have been drilled to the Carrizo in the area for irrigation use and 2 have been drilled in Pearsall for municipal supply. All the wells once overflowed, except the municipal wells at Pearsall and the Weissinger well (no. 96), 1 mile southwest of Pearsall, but by the fall of 1929 four of them had ceased to flow. During the spring of 1930, because of unusually heavy rainfall, little water was used for irrigation. As a result, the water levels in the nonflowing wells rose perceptibly, and one well began to overflow again.
With one or two exceptions all the wells are pumped, the flowing wells being equipped with pumps so as to increase the yield of water during periods when the demands for irrigation are heaviest. When the wells in the lower (southerly) part of the area are pumped continuously or allowed to flow continuously the static level in the wells in the upper (northerly) part of the area is lowered and the yield of the wells is decreased somewhat. All the flowing wells have declined somewhat in yield since they were drilled, the lowest (most southerly) wells showing the smallest decrease. The most productive well in the area is the Bennett well, \% miles south of Derby (no. 109). This well had a natural flow of 896 gallons a minute in 1928, according to a measurement by C. E. Ellsworth, of the United States Geological Survey. It yields about 2,000 gallons a minute when pumped. For many years the static level in the well stood at about 32 feet above the surface of the ground. In the pumping season of 1928-29 the well with others in the area was used intensively, and the level fell to only 12 feet above the surface. The level had risen to about 20 feet during the summer of 1930, when little water was used for irrigation. The Mills well (no. 106), 2% miles west of Derby, is also

IRRIGATION FROM WELLS

49

very productive, yielding about 800 gallons a minute. The static level in this well was 28 feet above the surface during the summer of 1930.
The water from these wells is used mostly for irrigating vegetables, especially onions, spinach, and tomatoes. There is some irrigation of cotton and corn, but during many seasons it is not necessary to irrigate these crops. In general two crops are raised on each tract of land during the year, one in summer and one in winter, and rotation of crops is employed so far as is practicable. The duty of water is variable and depends on the character of the crop and the rainfall during the growing season and to some extent on the skill of the individual farmer. For any crop the practice is to irrigate profusely until the crop is started and then to irrigate at intervals as needed to keep the plants growing vigorously in dry times. Accordingly much more water is used if the growing season is dry than if rains occur frequently.
Poteet-Pleasanton area. The largest area irrigated from wells in the Carrizo sand in Atascosa County is in the northern part of the county around Poteet and Pleasanton. The development thus far has been restricted generally to the lower lands in the Atascosa River Valley, but a few wells have been put down on higher lands some distance from the stream. The northernmost well in this district is 5 miles west of Poteet, and the southernmost is 3 miles southeast of Pleasanton. The area thus defined is 12 miles in length but only 2 or 3 miles wide. The development of irrigation in this area is not continuous and is most intensive near Poteet. (See pi. 1.)
The wells range in depth from less than 500 feet in the northern part of this area to more than 1,600 feet in the southern part. The long dimension of the area nearly coincides with the direction of the dip of the Carrizo sand, and this accounts for the comparatively great range in the depth of the wells. In the immediate vicinity of Poteet there are more than 50 wells that are supplied by the Carrizo sand. Many of these wells are used for irrigation, but at any given time there are always many wells not being used because of change in ownership, tenancy, or agricultural conditions. Most of the wells flow, and about one-fifth of them are allowed to flow continuously. Wells near the northerly limits of the area do not flow at present, though most of them flowed originally. The artesian head in the Carrizo sandstone in the area has fallen about 25 feet since the first well was drilled, and at Poteet it is now about 500 feet above sea level.
The yield of the wells in the area by natural overflow varies considerably, according to the location of the well and the size of the casing. The average flow in the vicinity of Poteet is probably less than 200 gallons a minute. Wells in the lower (southerly) part of the area for example, the Cunningham & Taliaferro well, 2 miles southeast of Pleasanton (no. 300), and the Anderson & Arneson well, 1 mile northeast of Jourdanton (no. 249) have estimated yields ranging from 450 to 650 gallons a minute. Many of the wells in the northerly part of the area are equipped with pumps. About half of the pumping plants consist of turbine or centrifugal pumps driven by electric motors, but air-compressor plants and gasoline motors- of several types are also used.
Irrigated tracts in this area are largely devoted to truck raising. The area is most widely known for its strawberries, to which the sandy soil is well adapted and for which high prices are commonly received. The first berries reach the market late in November or early in December, but the bulk of the crop is shipped in January, February, and March. Onions, spinach, beans, and other truck crops are also raised, and a few tracts of nursery land are irrigated. The duty of water varies materially according to the crop raised, the rainfall during the irrigation season, and the care with which the water is applied to the land.
Other areas. Wells in the Carrizo sand are used for irrigation in other parts of the area. The well of C. M. Kelley, west of Hindes, supplies water for irrigation.

50 GROUND WATER OF ATASCOSA AND FRIO COUNTIES, TEX.
The well is 2,390 feet deep and flows about 600 gallons a minute. The Blesse well (no. 112), 1 mile southwest of Dilley, is also used for irrigation.
In the San Miguel Valley, in Frio County, several wells have been drilled to the Carrizo sand, but these wells were not used for irrigation in 1929 and 1930. The J. E. Berry well (no. 24), 4% miles southeast of Moore, is the northernmost well in this area. It is 700 feet deep, and the water stands within 10 feet of the surface. Flowing wells of large yields at the Keystone ranch headquarters (no. 110) and the McGowen ranch headquarters (no. Ill) derive their water supplies from the Carrizo sand. These wells are used for domestic supply and for stock. '
IRRIGATION PROM WELLS IN MOUNT SELMAN FORMATION
Water from the Mount Sslman formation is used to some extent for irrigation, mainly around Pearsall and in east-central Atascosa County. It is most widely used, however, for stock and domestic supply.
Pearsall area. The first attempt at irrigation with water from the Mount Selman formation in the Pearsall area was in 1902, when a shallow well was drilled 1 mile north of the town. This well demonstrated that in this locality sands at comparatively shallow depths would yield sufficient water for irrigation, and soon after it was put down other wells were sunk for the same purpose, and the development has continued until the present time. The wells are from 100 to 200 feet deep and do not flow. The average pumping yield is not large, and the tracts irrigated from the wells are comparatively small. Only the best paying crops are irrigated, and the small size of the individual tracts is offset to a degree by the high returns obtained in years of good prices.
About 50 wells have been drilled and equipped with pumping plants for irrigation in an area lying for the most part north and northwest of the town. (See pi. 1.) Recently less than one-third of the pumping plants have been used for irrigation, owing chiefly to changes in land ownership, poor returns from irrigation, and inadequate funds. The largest tract irrigated in 1930 was 30 acres and the smallest 3 acres. The crops grown were tomatoes and tomato plants, beans, peas, onions, spinach, and citrus fruit. During every irrigation season many of the wells are pumped almost constantly, and between irrigation periods almost continuous pumping is also necessary to store sufficient water. The water in these wells drops to a level just above the top of the water sand soon after pumping is begiin, but no other effect is noticed. After the irrigation season the water surface returns to the level it had before the irrigation season.
Eastern Atascosa County area. North and northeast of Coughran, in eastern Atascosa County, some irrigation is carried on with waters from wells that are supplied by the Mount Selman sands. The irrigation wells range from 850 to 1,100 feet in depth, and all of them flow. The yield of the wells by natural flow ranges from a few gallons a minute near the northerly limit of the flowing-well area to several hundred gallons a minute farther south.
Irrigation thus far has been devoted largely to nursery stock and field crops. In 1930 only two tracts were irrigated, but in earlier years efforts have been made to irrigate other tracts. The water is in general highly mineralized, but the soils are exceedingly sandy, and apparently no ill effects have been experienced.
Other areas. Flowing wells have been developed in the Mount Selman formation in several other areas. At present the water is being used for domestic purposes or for livestock, but in places it could be used for irrigation. At Pleasanton and in an area of considerable size around it many flowing wells have been drilled. These range in depth from 300 to 850 feet and are mostly of small diameter. The yields range from only a few gallons to as much as 75 gallons a minute. A part

MUNICIPAL WATER SUPPLIES

51

of the public supply of Pleasanton is obtained from a well (no. 262) of this character 815 feet deep, and many homes in the town are supplied from similar privately owned wells. The water is satisfactory for domestic use, and some of it could be used for irrigation. Much of the water from the formation contains appreciable amounts of hydrogen sulphide. Many of the wells yield inflammable gas, which was formerly trapped in containers and used for heating and lighting, but with the advent of natural gas from the south Texas fields this practice has been discontinued.
In San Miguel Valley, in Frio County, several flowing wells have been obtained from the Mount Selman formation. Wells on lowlands near the stream flow from depths of a few hundred feet, but on the higher land deeper sands must be tapped in order to obtain flowing wells. The flow varies, but the maximum is about 35 gallons a minute. The wells having the largest yields, of which the Oppenheimer & Lang No. 2 well (no. 84) is an example, range in depth from 790 to 860 feet. Larger yields could be obtained if wells of larger diameter were drilled. The water is used only for stock but could be used for domestic purposes and irrigation.
IRRIGATION FROM WELLS IN COOK MOUNTAIN FORMATION
Water from sands and sandstones in the Cook Mountain formation has been used to some extent for irrigation in the vicinity of Dilley. Elsewhere in the area it is used only for domestic purposes and stock.
In the vicinity of Dilley about 40 wells have been drilled to the basal sand of the Cook Mountain formation for irrigation, the first one in 1927. The wells are 8 to 10 inches in diameter and from 204 to 510 feet deep. None of the wells flow, and the distance the water must be pumped ranges from about 55 to 120 feet. They are equipped with pumps of large capacity and yield sufficient water for the irrigation of tracts of 35 acres or more. The irrigated crops include citrus fruit, spinach, onions, tomatoes, and other vegetables, and flowers.
In 1930 comparatively little land was irrigated in the area because of changes in land ownership and low prices of farm products. Irrigation practice varied widely in the Dilley area, and no accurate data are available as to the average duty of water.

MUNICIPAL WATER SUPPLIES FROM WELLS IN CARRIZO SAND
The towns of Poteet, North Pleasanton, Jourdanton, Pearsall, and Dilley obtain their public water supplies from wells drilled to the Carrizo sand. The town wells at Poteet and North Pleasanton are flowing wells. All these wells are described in the well table (pp. 6480). Analyses of water from two of them are given in the table of analyses (pp. 60-61), as follows: Poteet, no. 218; Jourdanton, no. 250.
The water from these wells has been found to be satisfactory for municipal use. It contains a slight amount of hydrogen sulphide gas vut this is removed by aeration. Iron is also present but not in ^mounts sufficient to affect the quality of the water seriously. Most of the towns that use the Carrizo water have modern water-supply rystems operated by public-utility companies in connection with the manufacture of ice and the distribution of electric power. The usual

52 GROUND WATER OF ATASCOSA AND FRIO COUNTIES, TEX.
equipment includes a modern pumping plant and standpipe or elevated tank. At Poteet the water supply is obtained from flowing wells and rises by artesian pressure into a standpipe.. North Pleasanton is supplied from a well belonging to the San Antonio, Uvalde & Gulf Railroad, the water being sold to a public-utility company and distributed by it. No standpipe is needed, for the water in the well is under a static pressure of 43 pounds to the square inch.
WATER AVAILABLE FROM WELLS FOR DOMESTIC USE AND STOCK
Throughout most of Atascosa and Frio Counties water suitable for domestic use and livestock can be obtained at comparatively shallow depths. In the following pages the general ground-water conditions in various districts throughout the area are described. The conditions set forth for each district can be taken as typical for an area of considerable but indefinite size.
Extreme northern Atascosa County. In the northernmost part of Atascosa County water for stock and family use is obtained either in the Indio formation or the Carrizo sand. In the Indio formation water supplies that have a wide range in quantity and quality are obtained in wells at depths of 125 to 300 feet It is necessary to test this water to determine if it is satisfactory for drinking. In the outcrop area of the Carrizo sand, wells are obtained at depths ranging from about 125 to 200 feet and have water levels about 105 to 140 feet below the surface. These wells yield adequate supplies of satisfactory water. Wells 166 and 167 illustrate conditions in this area. (See pi. 1 and the well table and table of analyses.) In some localities immediately south of the Carrizo outcrop area wells drilled to the Carrizo obtain water at shallower depths than in fbn outcrop area, because of the rather steep slope of the land surface. This i" illustrated by the record of wells 169 and 170.
Anchorage and Rossville area. In the area near Anchorage and Rossvilb flowing wells are obtained from the Carrizo sand in low places along the Atascos:a, River at depths ranging from 380 to 646 feet. In the higher areas closer to th^ Carrizo outcrop the wells do not flow, but good wells may be obtained at 250 feet or less. Water can be obtained in this area from wells in the Mount Selman formation at depths of less than 100 feet, but the yield of the wells is less and the water of poorer quality. The records of wells 163, 164, and 165 illustrate the conditions in this area.
Campbellton area. The wells in Campbellton and vicinity yield bad water ?.t shallow depths, and it is very difficult to obtain satisfactory supplies for domest'c use except from very deep wells. The town obtains water from a dug well in alluvium near the Atascosa River. In the area generally dependence is placed on stored rain water for domestic purposes.
Charlotte area. The wells in the vicinity of Charlotte range from 100 to I,6f2 feet in depth, but most of them are between 100 and 300 feet deep. None of tl 3 wells flow, and the depth to water ranges from about 100 to 300 feet. Tl e shallower wells obtain water from the lower part of the Cook Mountain formation and the deeper ones from the Mount Selman formation and the Carrizo sand. The water is variable in quality but is generally suitable for domestic use. The records of wells 293 and 294 illustrate the conditions prevailing in the shallower wells.
Christine area. The surface rocks in the Christine area belong to the YegTia formation and are composed largely of gypsiferous clay with some beds of sand.

WATER FROM WELLS FOR DOMESTIC USE AND STOCK

53

Wells range in depth from 155 to 1,314 feet. Flowing wells are obtained at depths greater than 950 feet, and the town is supplied from a flowing well 1,314 feet deep (no. 295). Another well in the town 950 feet deep flows, but the water is of poor quality. The shallow well waters are of variable quality, and it is often necessary to case off sands containing bad water in order to obtain a satisfactory supply.
Crown area. Water-bearing sands are found at several depths in the Crown area. In the W. K. Shipman well (no. 337), 1 mile southeast of Crown, sands were found at 165, 357, 650 (Mount Selman), and 1,207 feet (Carrizo). Some of the upper waters are of poor quality. As a rule, however, water that is fairly satisfactory for domestic use can be obtained from shallow wells.
Dobrowolski area. Wells in the vicinity of Dobrowolski range from 150 to 200 feet in depth. The water is of fair quality and can be used for domestic purposes, stock, and boilers. Conditions are generally similar to those around Charlotte.
Hindes area. Flowing wells are obtained in the area round Hindes on low ground in San Miguel Valley from a sand in the Cook Mountain formation. At Hindes this sand is penetrated at depths of 380 to 440 feet. Wells are also obtained at about 150 feet, but the water is of poorer quality than that from the deeper sand. An analysis of the deeper water is given in the table on page 61 (no. 287). The Carrizo sand is encountered in this area at depths of about 1,900 feet. One well a mile southwest of the town has developed a large flow from that formation.
Jourdanton area. The municipal supply of Jourdanton is obtained from a well 1,635 feet deep (no. 250) <n which the water stands 6}4 feet below the ground surface. Other wells in the area range in depth from 400 to 1,500 feet. The C. S. Young well (no. 251) encountered sands at 300, 745, 810, and 931 feet, all in the Mount Selman formation. In general the shallow ground waters throughout this area are of poorer quality than the deeper waters.
Leming area. In and around Leming the Carrizo sand is the best available aquifer. It can be reached by wells less than 500 feet deep. Shallower wells In the Mount Selman formation yield water of variable quality, which is generally, however, fairly satisfactory for domestic use. The records of wells 170 and 171 illustrate conditions here. An analysis of water from well 171 is given in the table of water analyses.
Pleasanton, North Pleasanton, and Coughran area. In the area including Pleasanton, North Pleasanton, and Coughran there are many shallow wells that are supplied by the Mount Selman formation, and on low ground a considerable number of the wells flow. (See pi. 1.) There are also many deeper flowing wells. The depths of all wells in regard to which information was received range from 296 to 1,925 feet. Wells 260 to 280 are examples of shallow flowing weUs: wells 241, 244, 253, 254, 255, 256, 257, and 258 are deeper wells. The abundance of water-bearing sands is shown in the record of the E. R. Breaker well (no. 241), in which sands were found at 44, 200, 643, 927, and 1,206 feet. The water from the shallow and the deep wells is potable and generally suitable for domestic and irrigation uses. Analyses of water from 6 wells are given in the table of analyses.
Poteel area. The Carrizo sand is reached by wells in the Poteet area at depths ranging from 400 to 1,000 feet and is the principal source of the ground water used in the area for domestic purposes as well as for irrigation. It is customary throughout the area to drill wells to this horizon, and most of the wells flow. Before the development of these deeper wells water of poor quality was obtained from wells ending in the Mount Selman formation at depths of 30 to 50 feet. The wells in the Carrizo sand, despite the greater cost of drilling, are the most desirable, because the water can be used for irrigation as well as for domestic purposes. Wells 175 to 238 are in this area. Analyses of water from 6 of the wells are given in the table of analyses.

54 GROUND WATER OF ATASCOSA AND FRIO COUNTIES, TEX.
Northern Frio County. The beds that crop out in the northern part of County belong to the Carrizo sand and the Mount Selman formation. Over a considerable part of the area the Carrizo either is at the surface or lies at relatively shallow depths, and wells in it yield abundant supplies of good water. The wells are from 100 to 500 feet deep. Wells 1 to 19 illustrate conditions in this area. Water can be obtained in a part of the area from the Mount Selman formation at depths of about 100 to 450 feet, but the water is of poor quality, and the wells yield much less freely than those in the Carrizo sand. In some areas in northeastern Frio County there is difficulty in obtaining potable water from the Mount Selman. Wells in the lower part of the Mount Selman formation (Bigford member) yield water of poor quality.
Derby area. In the Derby area records were obtained of wells ranging in depth from 203 to 455 feet. These wells obtain their water from the Mount Selman formation. Wells 146, 147, 148, 149, 150, 151, 152, 153, 343, and 344 are representative.
Dilley area. The shallow water in the area around Dilley is described in the section on water in the Cook Mountain formation (p. 40). Records were obtained of wells ranging in depth from 119 to 137 feet. West of Dilley, in the west-central part of the county, the water is found under generally similar conditions but is of more variable quality.
Pearsall area. Shallow wells in the Pearsall area are discussed in the section on water in the Carrizo sand and Mount Selman formation (pp. 26, 34). The conditions there described prevail over a fairly wide area. Water is usually obtained in wells at depths ranging from about 100 to 250 feet. The water, though usually potable, varies considerably in mineral content. In an area east of Pearsall the sandy upper beds of the Mount Selman formation are at or near the surface and supply wells ranging from about 65 to 250 feet in depth. These wells yield the best water found in the Mount Selman formation anywhere in the area.
WELL DRILLING AND PUMPING METHODS
Most of the water wells of the area are drilled, only a few of them being dug wells. Methods of well drilling differ considerably according to the type and depth of the well and the district in which it is located. The wells drilled for domestic or ranch supply are generally shallow, averaging about 250 feet deep, and are drilled by hydraulic-rotary or cable-tool percussion-drilling machines (pi. 8). The wells range from 4 to 8 inches in diameter and are cased to variable depths. If sands yielding water of poor quality are penetrated these sands are cased off, and the remainder of the well below is uncased. In some domestic wells, however, casing is set the entire depth, or to the water-bearing sand. The domestic and ranch wells are pumped almost entirely by cylinder pumps with windmill power. Strong, fairly constant winds are common, and therefore an adequate supply of water can be obtained by this method.
Pearsall area. The methods of drilling and pumping wells drilled for irrigation vary considerably in the Pearsall area. The wells range in depth from ICO to 2,500 feet and the pumping lift and yield is very variable. At Pearsall, in the shallow irrigation district, the greater number of wells are 100 feet deep, but a few are as much as 200 feet deep. The water-bearing sands are generally encountered at depths less than 100 or 200 feet, but the drilling contracts are usually made on the basis of drilling a well to either of these two depths.

WELL DRILLING AND PUMPING METHODS

55

The irrigation wells are nearly all 10 inches in diameter, though a few are only 6 or 8 inches. The wells are cased to a depth of about 10 feet, or only deep enough to exclude surface run-off and to keep the weathered rock and soil from falling into the well. Below 10 feet the holes remain open and in good shape, owing to the fact that the shales, clays, and sandstones of the Mount Selman formation do not cave readily. It is customary, in the Pearsall district, to drill two wells for each irrigation installation. These are spaced either 15 or 20 feet apart and are fitted with cylinder pumps that are operated by a walking beam connected to a crank and drive shaft. One engine or motor can then drive both pumps. There are a few single irrigation wells in the district, but most of these are used to irrigate very small tracts. One installation consists of three wells spaced 15 feet apart in a line and pumped simultaneously with one engine.
Practically all the wells in this district have been drilled with the cable-tool percussion-type drilling machine, such as is shown in plate 8, B. Machines of this type are suitable for sinking wells as much as 1,000 feet deep. The pumps are of the cylinder type, the cylinders being 4 to 5% inches in diameter. In the pumping installations in which the walking beam, crank, and pitman are used the length of stroke of the cylinder can be varied, thereby changing the yield. In certain other types of installation the stroke of the cylinder is fixed, and the yield can be varied only by changing the speed of the engine.
Power for pumping the irrigation wells at Pearsall is supplied by electric motors, stationary gasoline engines, oil engines, and converted automobile motors. If the tract of land to be irrigated covers only a few acres, an improvised power plant probably serves reasonably well. However, well operators of larger irrigation tracts use more substantial power installations, the electric motor being preferred. Some electric installations are fitted with automatic controls and hence require very little attention.
On some of the irrigated tracts at Pearsall the water is conducted directly from the wells to the land. This is not practicable except on the smaller tracts, because the yield of the wells is too small to maintain a proper irrigation head in long ditches, especially during dry, hot periods. It is customary, therefore, to build concrete storage reservoirs ranging in capacity from about 100,000 to 200,000 gallons and to store water pumped during the night in these reservoirs for use the following day. During times of most intense irrigation the wells may be pumped almost continuously for several days, but this is not the normal practice.
The cost of drilling wells in the Pearsall district is more or less standardized. At the time this investigation was made the customary cost of drilling was $1.25 a foot for the first 100 feet, including the labor of placing the casing and fitting the pump. Deep wells cost slightly more per foot of depth. As most of the wells are cased only for 10 feet the cost of ca'sing is slight. The cost of pump pipe was 46 to 97 cents a foot, according to the quality of the pipe. The cylinder and strainer could be obtained for about $50, the exact cost depending on the size and quality. The cost of the power-plant installation varies with the type.
Dilley area. Irrigation wells in the Dilley area range from about 250 to 400 feet in depth. The yield is considerably greater than that of the shallow wells at Pearsail, and the depth to water is greater. The wells are drilled with a hydraulicrotary drilling machine, similar to that shown in plate 8, A. In the Dilley are% nearly all the wells have been drilled by one driller. Most of them are 10 inches in diameter, but a few are only 6 or 8 inches. Some wells are cased to the bottom, others have only one length of casing at the surface, and still others are cased to intermediate depths. There seems to be no uniform casing practice, and frequently the cost of the casing governs the type and amount of casing used. Some of the uncased wells have caved, and it would therefore seem desirable to case the wells in this district from top to bottom.

56 GROUND WATER OF ATASCOSA AND FRIO COUNTIES, TEX.
Several types of pumps are used in the Dilley area. The deep-well cylinder pumps with geared pump jacks are perhaps more numerous than any other type. A number of wells are pumped with turbine pumps, which are operated by electric motors connected directly to the upper end of the pump shaft. A few centrifugal pumps are used. Most of the pumps are operated with electric motors, but gasoline engines, gasoline tractors, and oil engines are also used. The cost of drilling, equipping, and operating wells is greater than in the Pearsall area, because the wells are deeper and the lift greater. The drilling cost averages about $1.75 a foot for a well 10 inches in diameter; the casing costs $1.50 a foot. A typical installation, consisting of a turbine pump with a capacity of 250 gallons a minute and a 15-horsepower electric motor, costs between $600 and $1,000, depending on the make and the length of the pump setting.
In the Dilley area considerable irrigation is done directly from the wells, but on some farms earth reservoirs are used. Several concrete reservoirs are also in use. Direct irrigation is adequate for tracts of land as large as 15 acres, as the yield of the wells is sufficient to maintain an adequate irrigation head.
Poteet area. The irrigation wells in the Poteet district illustrate another type of construction and use, as they are of intermediate depth and many of them flow. They range in depth from 550 to 1,050 feet; the shallower ones are in the northern part of the district. Most of the wells are 8 inches in diameter at the top and either 4 or 6 inches in diameter at the bottom. There is no imiform practice in this area in the amount of casing used, and many wells are insufficiently cased, simply because the owner desired to keep the initial cost of the well at a minimum. Some of the wells, however, are cased to the water-bearing sand, or for their entire depth. In such wells, the casing is set on a hard-rock layer above the sand, or it is extended into the sand and the length that penetrates the sand is perforated. In some of the wells perforated casing has been used for a considerable distance above the water-bearing sand; in others the perforated casing extends a considerable distance below the sand. Because of this practice, many of the wells yield water of inferior quality. The wells have generally been drilled with hydraulic-rotary machines of the type shown in plate 8, A. Some of the earlier wells, however, were drilled by the cable-tool percussion method. A few of the wells were drilled with large hydraulic-rotary machines such as are used in oil-well drilling.
Many of the wells at Poteet are flowing wells. A large number of them are not equipped with valves and are allowed to flow continuously. Reservoirs are generally used in conjunction with all the flowing wells that furnish water for irrigation. The reservoirs are made of earth and range in size from a fraction of an acre to 4 acres. Many farms, however, are irrigated directly from the wells.
Nonflowing wells and wells that yield only a small quantity by natural flow are pumped. In such wells the depth to water is not great, and therefore the pumping plants are not as elaborate as at Dilley. Centrifugal pumps, air lifts, and a few turbine pumps are used. The pumps are operated with electric motors, tractors, stationary gasoline engines, and oil engines. On the whole there has been very little electrification of pumping plants, and the installations in general are somewhat crude.
Deep wells. The deep irrigation wells and deep wells used for municipal supply have been drilled usually with oil-well drilling equipment. Some of the wells have been drilled by oil-field contractors; others have been drilled by firms engaged only in water-well drilling. The wells are from 1,300 to 2,500 feet deep and generally obtain water from the Carrizo sand. The deep wells are cased to prevent the contamination of the Carrizo waters by mineralized water from the higher formations.

QUALITY OF THE WATEK

57

The diameter of the wells ranges from 6 to 16 inches. The diameter at the bottom is usually less than that at the top, for in most wells the casing has been reduced in size one or more times. The Pearsall city well (no. 94), which is 1,303 feet deep, has 155 feet of 16-inch casing, 806 feet of 8-inch casing, 65 feet of 6-inch casing, 104 feet of 8-inch screen, and 81 feet of 6-inch screen. The city well at Jourdanton (no. 250) is 1,635 feet deep and has 162 feet of 10-inch casing, 1,118 feet of 8-inch casing, 267 feet of 6-inch casing, and 99 feet of 6-inch screen. These wells are cited as examples of properly drilled wells in which great care was taken to insure a good finish. Some of the older irrigation wells were not so well constructed.
No exact figures are available on the cost of the deeper wells. It has been reported that one well recently drilled near Pearsall to a depth of about 1,350 feet and fitted with a pump cost $8,000. This is probably a minimum cost, for the well was drilled as economically as possible. Figures showing the cost of earlier wells are not applicable to conditions prevailing at the time the investigation was made.
QUALITY OF THE WATER
Water analyses. The table of analyses (p. 60) shows that the waters vary widely in chemical character. This is due largely to inherent differences in the chemfcal character of the rocks of the various formations and perhaps in part to chemical reactions that have occurred in the waters within the rocks. In general the amount of dissolved material in water from a given formation varies directly with the depth of the formation beneath the surface. The greater the depth the longer the water has been in the formation and the greater has been its solvent action on soluble minerals present in the formation. As is to be expected, the waters from clean sandstones contain less dissolved material than those from formations containing alternating clays and impure sands.
Water analyses are of importance in determining the adaptability of water for domestic and industrial supply and for irrigation. In the area covered by this report industrial demands for water are not great, and the analyses are of chief importance as indicating whether the water is suitable for domestic use or irrigation. The analyses do not show the sanitary condition of the waters, and statements based on the analyses are made without reference to possible pollution of the waters.
The chemical character of the waters is determined by the quantities and proportions of the basic radicles calcium, magnesium, and sodium and the acid radicles bicarbonate, sulphate, and chloride. Calcium and magnesium affect the value of water for industrial uses, mainly because of the hardness that they cause. Sodium and potassium compounds may cause trouble in irrigation. If the acid radicle is carbonate or bicarbonate the resulting product is sodium carbonate or sodium bicarbonate ("black alkali")- The sulphate and chloride salts are less harmful and form "white alkali."

Requirements Jor domestic use. The adaptability, in a chemical sense, of a water for domestic use is dependent to some extent on the experience of the people using it. If they have been accustomed to waters of low mineral content they will regard as bad waters in which the mineral content is only slightly higher. On the other hand, if they have lived in regions where the waters in general are somewhat heavily charged with mineral matter they will use without question water that may be rather highly mineralized. Waters of the latter type are most common in southwestern Texas. The taste of the water is important, for waters containing as much as 1,500 parts per million of dissolved materials and having a pleasant taste are still acceptable. Next to taste, softness is the most important quality of a water for domestic use. Some soft and otherwise desirable waters are rendered unpalatable by the presence of magnesium salts or sodium chloride, which give them a disagreeable taste.
Requirements jor irrigation. Water for irrigation must be of such chemical nature as not to damage ijie soil on which it is used. There is no fixed standard by which the quality of water for this purpose can be gaged, and it is almost impossible to construct such a standard. The type of water that can be used with safety varies greatly with the type of soil and subsoil, topography, crops, and climate. In Atascosa and Frio Counties the average annual rainfall is around 24 inches, and much of it is concentrated into violent rainstorms. The soils range from extremely porous sandy soils with very good subsurface drainage to clay soils that are almost impermeable. In the sandy soils, any accumulation of objectionable salts from irrigation waters will be largely dissolved and washed out of the soils by the torrential rains. In the clay soils the salts tend to accumulate. It is obvious that a set of standards which does not take into account the physical character of the soils would be of no value. In general, it can be stated that waters with more than 200 parts per million of sodium carbonate and a total of more than 1,000 parts per million of sodium carbonate, sodium sulphate, sodium chloride, magnesium chloride, and magnesiun sulphate should not be used on soils that do. not have good subsoil drainage. Use of water with 200 to 500 parts per million of sodium carbonate is dangerous and should not be undertaken unless a careful investigation shows the drainage conditions are exceptionally good. If the water contains more than 500 parts per million of sodium carbonate its use is certain to result in serious damage to all except the most sandy soils with ideal drainage conditions. In addition it should be kept in mind that the total of the salts previously mentioned should not exceed 2,000 parts per million and that waters with 1,000 to 2,000 parts per million of these constituents demand careful handling.

QUALITY OP THE WATEK

59

It should be understood that this general outline of standards for use of irrigation waters is not universally applicable. Examples are known, in Atascosa and Frio Counties, of water with dissolved mineral matter in excess of the limits given that has been used for years with no apparent ill effects. The conditions of drainage, however, were ideal, and the soil very sandy. At the same time one tract of land irrigated with water containing less than 250 parts per million of total dissolved constituents and less than 100 parts of sodium carbonate showed distinct, progressive damage. The soil was of a clayey type, the irrigation was excessive, and the drainage was very poor. Users of water for irrigation should keep in mind constantly the fact that the matter of drainage is of the utmost importance.

62 GROUND WATER OP ATASCOSA AND FBIO COUNTIES, TEX.
CONSERVATION OF THE WATER SUPPLY
In the season of 1929-30 the discharge of the irrigation wells and of the flowing wells used for other purposes was measured or estimated, the land irrigated with water from wells was mapped (pi. 1), the kind of crops raised was recorded, the amount of water used for each crop was studied, and the quantity of water wasted from each well was computed. This survey revealed the facts that although some of the wells are shut down when the water is not needed, a considerable number in both counties are allowed to flow continuously, and a surprisingly large quantity of water is completely wasted or used to only a minor extent for watering livestock or maintaining fish ponds. Waste occurs from all three of the sandstones that furnish water for irrigation, but attention was given especially to the Carrizo sand, from which the greatest quantities of water are wasted.
The flow of the wells was ascertained approximately by weir measurements, rough volumetric or float measurements, or estimates. On the basis of all data obtained it was estimated that in 1929-30 water was being discharged by wells in the Car-rizo sand at the rate of about 16,000 acre-feet a year about 9,500 acre-feet by wells in Atascosa County and about 6,500 acre-feet by wells in Frio County.
The results of the survey, as presented in plate 1, show that the total area irrigated in 1929-30 with water obtained from the Carrizo sand was 2,085 acres 1,350 acres in Atascosa County and 735 acres in Frio County.
In 1929-30 there was more rainfall than normal, and therefore the quantity of water used for irrigation was less than usual. On the basis of the studies that were made the average annual duty of water was placed at 2.4 acre-feet to the acre in Atascosa County and 2.8 acrefeet in Frio County, although it is recognized that with the best irrigation practice somewhat smaller amounts would probably be adequate. It was therefore computed that, with the acreage irrigated in 1929-30, the quantity of water from the Carrizo sand that is beneficially used for irrigation in a year of average rainfall amounts to about 5,300 acre-feet 3,200 acre-feet in Atascosa County and 2,100 acre-feet in Frio County. These computations lead to the startling conclusion that in each county about two-thirds of the water withdrawn from the underground reservoir formed by the Carrizo sand is virtually wasted.
In both the Pearsall area and the Poteet area there has been some decline in artesian head and a corresponding decline in discharge from each well. The decline has not been great, but nevertheless it has been sufficient to cause some of the wells to cease flowing. If the waste of artesian water were eliminated there would doubtless be an appreciable restoration of head, such as occurred during the winter of 1929-30, when, because of heavy rainfall, only a small amount of

CONSERVATION OF THE WATER SUPPLY

water was used for irrigation and wells resumed flowing that had ceased to flow in 1928. It is estimated that by eliminating the waste it will be possible to put under irrigation about 4,000 acres of additional land in the two counties without making any additional draft upon the underground reservoir.
Frequent measurements are being made of depths to water level in selected wells for both counties. This program of water-level measurements is to be continued, and a partial resurvey of the discharge and use of ground water is to be made. The records of depth to water thus far obtained indicate that in both counties there has been a small net decline in the head of the water in the Carrizo sand since the investigation was begun in 1929, while the head in the Mount Selman formation has remained practically unchanged. A longer record of water levels and correlative rates of discharge must be obtained before a close estimate of safe yield can be made. The data at hand, however, lead to the conclusion that the present beneficial use is not in excess of the safe yield and that further irrigation developments can safely be made to utilize all or most of the total discharge as shown by the survey of 1929-30, provided effective steps are taken to eliminate the waste.

GEOLOGY AND GKOUND-WATEB EESOUBCES OF ATASCOSA AND FEIO COUNTIES, TEXAS
By JOHN T. LONSDALE
ABSTRACT
Atascosa and Frio Counties are in southwestern Texas and form a part of the Winter Garden district. The purpose of the investigation here recorded was to determine the source, quantity, and quality of the ground water used for irrigation and other purposes in the area.
The rock formations exposed are of Tertiary and Quaternary age and dip toward the east or southeast at a greater angle than the slope of the land surface, resulting in northeastward-trending belts of the outcropping formations. This general structure is modified by a large syncline in the western part of the area and by smaller anticlines and faults in other parts. These, however, do not affect greatly the movement of ground water. In order from oldest to youngest the exposed formations are the Indio formation (800 feet thick), of Wilcox age; the Carrizo sand (425 feet), the basal or Bigford member of the Mount Selman formation (0-500 feet), the post-Bigford beds of the Mount Selman formation (700 feet), the Cook Mountain formation (600 feet), and the Yegua formation (500 feet), all of Claiborne age; the Jackson formation (500 feet); the Catahoula tuff (600 feet), of Miocene age; the Goliad sand (20 feet), of Pliocene (?) age; and the Leona formation (75 feet), of Pleistocene age.
The chief water-bearing formations in the area are the Carrizo sand, the Mount Selman formation, and the Cook Mountain formation. The Carrizo sand crops out in the northern part of the area and furnishes shallow wells in the outcrop area and deeper flowing and nonflowing wells south and southeast of the outcrop. Water from this formation is of good quality and is used for irrigation near Pearsail, in Frio County, and Poteet, in Atascosa County. Maps accompanying the report show 'the outcrop of the sandstone, depths to the sandstone south and southeast of the outcrop, heights to which the water will rise, and the area in which flowing wells can be obtained.
The Mount Selman and Cook Mountain formations consist of discontinuous beds of sandstone, clay, shale, and lignite. The formations are important sources of water for domestic use and to some extent for irrigation. The waters are of variable quality, some being highly mineralized, and vary also in quantity. Water from the Mount Selman formation is used for irrigation near Pearsall and in eastern Atascosa County, and flowing wells are obtained in this formation east of Pearsall and near Pleasanton. The Cook Mountain formation yields water for irrigation near Dilley and supplies flowing wells in southeastern Frio County and southwestern Atascosa County near Hindes. The other formations of the area yield smaller amounts of water for domestic use and stock. These waters also are of variable quality, many being highly mineralized.
The investigation showed that a considerable amount of water from flowing wells is being wasted. If this water were conserved considerable additional irrigation could be carried on. Measurements of the water level in wells from the Carrizo sand (still being continued) lead to the tentative conclusion that the 'safe yield from this formation has not been exceeded.

INTRODUCTION
PURPOSE OF INVESTIGATION
This report covers the results of an investigation in Atascosa and Frio Counties, Tex., which was begun in 1929 under the direction of the Engineering Experiment Station of the Agricultural and Mechanical College of Texas at the joint request of the officials of the Missouri Pacific Kailroad and of residents in the area. Early in 1930 an arrangement was made to incorporate the investigation into the general program of ground-water investigations which is being carried out by the State Board of Water Engineers through cooperation with the United States Geological Survey and which covers several adjacent or nearby counties, including Dimmit, Zavala, Medina, Uvalder Duval, and Webb. This report, therefore, represents the results of a cooperative project between the Engineering Experiment Station, the Texas Board of Water Engineers, and the United States Geological Survey. The investigation was undertaken for the purpose of determining the resources of ground water in the area with special reference to the supply available for irrigation. The field work occupied June, July, and August in both 1929 and 1930, a part of December in 1931, and a part of June in 1932. During the season of 1929 an office was maintained at Pearsall, and in 1930 offices were maintained at both Pearsall and Jourdanton. During the season of 1930 the writer wa& ably assisted by M. T. Halbouty.
ACKNOWLEDGMENTS
The writer is indebted to many persons who contributed information and assistance in the field and assisted in the preparation of this report. Mr. W. B. Cook, of the Missouri Pacific Railroad, and hi& associates cooperated by supplying engineering and agricultural data. Mr. N. H. Hunt and Mr. L. F. Merl, secretaries respectively of the Pearsall and Dilley Chambers of Commerce, contributed data concerning wells and extended many courtesies. Well logs were supplied by Mr. W. D. Morrison, of Dilley; Mr. C. S. Young, of Jourdanton; Mr. F. M. Getzendaner and Mr. L. F. McCollum, of the Humble Oil & Refining Co.; and Mr. J. M. Dawson, of the Gulf Production Co. Mr. Getzendaner also gave freely of his store of geologic information relating to the area. Messrs. A. R. Denison and L. W. Clark, of the Amerada Petroleum Corporation,, supplied information concerning Cook Mountain contacts in Frio County and oil wells drilled by the company. Miss Julia Gardner, of the United States Geological Survey, identified fossils collected by the writer and helped him to map geologic boundaries in parts of the area. Mr. W. N. White, of the Geological Survey, who is in charge of the ground-water investigation in Texas, spent several days in the field with the writer and

data in the files of the United States Geological Survey collected by Messrs. Alexander Deussen and S. S. Nye. The investigation was made under the general direction of Mr. O. E. Meinzer, geologist in charge of the division of ground water in the Geological Survey.
LOCATION OF AREA
Atascosa and Frio Counties are in southwestern Texas (see fig. 1) and comprise a part of the area that is commonly called the Winter Garden district, the boundaries of which are rather loosely defined. Atascosa County has an area of 1,350 square miles and Frio County

4 GROUND WATER OF ATASCOSA AND FRIO COUNTIES, TEX.
1,124 square miles. The principal towns are Poteet, Pleasanton, North Pleasanton, Jourdanton, Lytle, Christine, and Campbellton, in Atascosa County; and Moore, Pearsall, Derby, Melon, Dilley, and Bigfoot, in Frio County.
TOPOGRAPHY AND DRAINAGE
Atascosa and Frio Counties are within the Western Gulf section of the Coastal Plain, which in this part of Texas extends from the Edwards Plateau, on the north and northwest, to the Gulf of Mexico, on the south and southeast. The general pattern of the surface is that of a uniform southeastward slope, somewhat dissected by southeastward-flowing streams. Thus Lytle, in the northwestern part of Atascosa County, has an altitude of about 730 feet above sea level, and Campbellton, in the southern part of the same county, has an altitude of only about 250 feet. In some parts the surface forms a true plain with very little relief, but in general the interstream areas are belts of relatively high land that have a southeasterly trend. In some places the more resistant beds have formed escarpments that face west or north. The greatest relief is in the northern part of the area, especially in northwestern Frio County, where the outcropping rocks contain beds of variable hardness and the streams have dissected the once uniform upland into prominent hills and valleys.
The principal streams of the area are the Frio, Atascosa, and Leona Rivers and San Miguel Creek. Minor streams of. some importance are Hondo, Seco, Lagunillas, Siestadero, and Turkey Creeks. All these streams are intermittent. Floods occur during and immediately after heavy rains, but these floods subside in a few hours or at the most in a few days, and during the greater part of the time the streams either are dry or contain disconnected pools which dwindle during protracted periods of drought until little or no water remains. The channels of the Frio River in the region below Derby and of the Atascosa River below Poteet contain water nearly all the year. This is partly due to the inflow of waste water from artesian wells, that are allowed to flow continually.
The amount of standing water in the stream channels during dry times is related to the character of the underlying rocks. In sandstone areas the stream channels are usually completely dry at such times, but in shale areas they frequently contain pools of water for long periods. This difference gives a clue as to the source of some of the ground water in the sandstone formations of the area.
The larger streams are bordered by belts of alluvium, but these are narrow and poorly defined except along the Frio and Atascosa Rivers and San Miguel Creek in the southern part of the area. The

alluvial deposits do not enter into the ground-water problems of the district.
VEGETATION
The native vegetation reflects to a degree the semiarid subtropical character of the climate. Nearly everywhere the uncultivated areas are covered with a growth of varying density of scrub trees or chaparral. The trees consist dominantly of mesquite in the western part of the area and of mesquite and scrub oak in the eastern part. The chaparral consists chiefly of black brush, catclaw, juahillo (wah-ee'yo), scrub mesquite, and prickly pear and other types of cactus. Near the streams are found trees of considerable size, such as the pecan, cypress, and live oak. Oaks of fairly large size also occur on the divides between the streams in the eastern part of the area. A variety of grasses flourish in open spaces among the trees and chaparral.

TRANSPORTATION
The area is crossed by branch lines of the Missouri Pacific Railroad. The International-Great Northern Railroad passes in a north-south, direction through the northwestern part of Atascosa County and the central part of Frio County. Moore, Pearsall, Melon, Derby, and Dilley, in Frio County, are on this line. One branch of the San Antonio, Uvalde & Gulf division of the Missouri Pacific Railroad passes through north-central Atascosa County and another through the southern part of the county, the towns of Leming, Pleasanton, Jourdanton, Dobrowolski, Charlotte, and Hindes being on the firstnamed branch and Coughran, McCoy, and Campbellton on the other. A third line, the San Antonio Southern Railway, passes through Poteet and Jourdanton and terminates at Christine.
Both Atascosa and Frio Counties are provided with good trunk automobile roads. State highway 2, between San Antonio and Laredo, passes through Frio County, following the line of the InternationalGreat Northern Railroad. State highway 85, from Dilley to Eagle Pass, crosses the southwestern part of the county. Highway 9 crosses Atascosa County from north to south through Leming, Pleasanton, and Campbellton, and a short branch of it (highway 97) extends from Pleasanton to Jourdanton. In the northern part of the county the Palo Alto road from San Antonio extends to Poteet.
All the highways converge at San Antonio, which is the supply and market point for tne area. Secondary automobile roads, which are generally graded and open for travel except in very bad weather, connect all parts of the area. It should be noted that dirt roads passing over certain of the clay formations, such as the Yegua, are impassable after heavy rains.

AGRICULTURE
Atascosa and Frio Counties are to some extent in a stage of transition from stock raising to farming. Until within a comparatively few years very little farming was carried on, and practically the entire area in both counties was devoted to cattle raising. Some of the most famous early ranches in Texas were located in this area.
In recent years farming has been on the increase, much of the development having started with the building of the railroads. In most of the area dry farming is practiced. Cotton is raised extensively, and in Atascosa County it is the largest crop, but in Frio County the rainfall in many years is insufficient to mature the cotton. Corn, various sorghums, and other dry-land crops are raised.
Winter truck farming, with irrigation from wells, has become important in the area. Poteet furnishes large amounts of early strawberries and vegetables. Areas around Pearsall and Dilley furnish onions, spinach, tomatoes, and other vegetables. Large tracts still remain and probably will continue to remain as ranch land, but in general farming is being extended. According to the agricultural census of the United States, 37.9 percent of Atascosa County and 54.8 percent of Frio County were in farms in 1925. Below is a table compiled from the 1925 census showing the kinds of crops raised and the acreage devoted to each crop. The table does not include strawberries, because information was not available as to the acreage of that crop.

HISTORY
The history of Atascosa and Frio Counties is an interesting story of the winning of frontier lands from Indians, the .development of ranching, the building of railroads, and finally a gradual change into a combination of ranching and farming. Only a brief summary of this history can be given here.
Venturesome stockmen established themselves in the area in the early fifties. At that time and for 25 years afterward the region was subject to Indian raids, the Frio County area being the more vulnerable because of its greater distance from San Antonio.

MAPS

/

Atascosa County was delimited and organized in 1871. The county seat was first at Novatascosa, but later it was moved to Pleasanton and still later to Jourdanton. Until 1908 the only railroad in the county passed through the extreme northwestern part. In 1908 and 1909 two railroads, the San Antonio, Uvalde & Gulf and the San Antonio Southern, were built into the county, and Jourdanton, Poteet, and Christine were established as stations on them.
The first flowing well at Poteet, in Atascosa County, was drilled in 1904. before the advent of the railroad, and this demonstration of the availability of artesian water had much to do with the initiation of railroad building in the area. By 1910 there were 10 artesian wells, and thereafter several were drilled each year until the period of the World War, when drilling was stopped on account of the high cost of sinking the wells and providing them with pumping equipment. More recently well drilling has been resumed, and there are now more than 50 artesian wells in the Poteet area. The development of truck farming has paralleled the sinking of the artesian wells.
Frio County was also organized in 1871, with the county seat at Frio Town. In 1881 the county seat was moved to Pearsall, then a new town on the International-Great Northern Railroad, which had recently been built through the county. The original courthouse at Frio Town is still intact and is one of the historic landmarks of the region.
The first flowing well in Frio County was drilled near Pearsall in 1905. Since then, deep wells have been drilled from time to time in the Frio Valley area, west and southwest of Pearsall. Most of these wells flow and furnish water for irrigation of considerable extent.
Irrigation with water pumped from shallow wells was started in the Pearsall area in 1905, and the development reached its height about 1923. Pump-well irrigation was begun in the vicinity of Dilley about 1925 and has since gradually developed.
MAPS
Two maps accompany this report. Plate 1 shows the areal geology, the original and present areas of artesian flow, and the location of record wells and of lands irrigated with water from wells. Plate 2 shows the depths to the top of the Carrizo sand and the height above sea level to which water from the Carrizo sand would rise in 1930. The map of Frio County used as a base for showing the geologic and hydrologic data was .traced from a soil map of the county prepared by M. W. Beck, of the United States Department of Agriculture, and made available through the courtesy of Mr. A. B. Conner, director of the Texas Agricultural Experiment Station. The base map of Atascosa County was prepared by M. T. Halbouty, by compilation of

8 GROUND WATER OF ATASCOSA AND FRIO COUNTIES, TEX.
data from existing county and land maps and by a plane-table traverse which covered about one-third of the county.
CLIMATE
Texas is remarkable for its great variety of climate. The extreme eastern part of the State has an average annual rainfall of more than 45 inches. The precipitation decreases gradually from east to west, the annual average being less than 30 inches at San Antonio and less than 20 inches at Eagle Pass. Atascosa County on the average receives 25 to 30 inches annually as compared with 20 to 25 inches in Frio County.
There is a considerable range in temperature in the two counties. Summer temperatures are frequently higher than 100° and during the winter there is generally at least one killing frost. During the period of record the growing season has varied from 220 to 298 days. Observations made intermittently since 1908 record a minimum temperature of 13°.
In most years there is some rain every month. The heaviest precipitation usually occurs in April, May, and the early part of June and in September and October. February is also a wet month, especially in Frio County. August is the driest month. There is a tendency for the precipitation to be concentrated in heavy rains, which frequently cause floods. In many years there is a decided shortage of rainfall during the summer, especially in July and August. Crops therefore must be specially adapted to dry farming or must be irrigated.
Tables showing available records of rainfall and dates of the first killing frost in the fall and the last killing frost in the spring in the two counties, and of rainfall at Kunge, in Karnes County, are given below, from reports of the United States Weather Bureau.

GENERAL GEOLOGY

The rock formations exposed in Atascosa and Frio Counties are of Tertiary and Quaternary age, but Upper Cretaceous and Lower Cretaceous formations have been encountered in a considerable number of deep wells drilled for oil in the central and northern parts of the area, and they doubtless everywhere underlie the exposed formations. There are many problems of stratigraphy and correlation in the area, but most of them are not within the scope of this report. Plate 1 shows the outcrops of the formations except deposits of Pliocene (?) and Quaternary age. The geologic table on page 18 shows the relations and characteristics of the several formations present.
The information concerning the unexposed formations is based on their character as observed at their outcrops north of Frio and Atascosa Counties and on data obtained from the deep wells in these counties. The wells usually pass through Tertiary and Upper Cretaceous formations and end in the Lower Cretaceous a short distance below the top of the Edwards limestone. No commercial production of oil has yet been found in either of these counties except in the Somerset field, which extends from the vicinity of Somerset, in Bexar County, into the northern part of Atascosa County.
The unexposed formations are practically unavailable for water supply, because they are encountered at depths that are too great for economical development. Hence no attempt is made here to give detailed descriptions or correlations of these formations. A section which is probably more or less typical of the entire area is shown in the log of the North & Walton No. 1 C. C. Tribble well near Bigfoot, in the northeastern part of Frio County, which reached a depth of 3,560 feet. The correlation of the formations encountered in this well is given below. It should be understood that these formations will be encountered at greater depths to the south and southeast and that they may change in lithologic character and thickness. South of the latitude of Pleasanton no oil-test well has penetrated to the bottom of the Tertiary system in either of these counties. Southeast

The general geologic structure of the area is comparatively simple. The most prominent feature is a general gulfward dip of the formations at a greater angle than the slope of the land surface. It is to this structural feature that the presence of artesian water is due. " Frio County, however, lies on the northeast edge of a regional syncline, the axis of which extends northwestward and passes near Gardendale, in La Salle County, and La Pryor, in Zavala County. The strata in the western part of Frio County are affected by this syncline and by an anticline or nose superimposed upon the northeast flank of the syncline. The axis of the anticline is approximately parallel to the course of the Leona River. Reverse dips and outliers of Cook Mountain strata northeast of the Leona River are due to the presence of this anticline or nose. In the northwestern part of Atascosa County the structure that has produced the Somerset oil field is revealed in a considerable fault affecting the strata of the Indio and Carrizo formations. In southeastern Atascosa County an anticline of some size may be present northeast of Campbellton and is indicated on the geologic map. The strata affected are those of the Yegua and Jackson formations.
Small faults have been encountered in northwestern Frio County and were mapped by A. N. Sayre. Minute faults were also found in
1 Since the completion of the field work the Amerada Petroleum Corporation has drilled several deep wells southwest of Pearsall to test the anticlinal structure mentioned on p. 136. The deepest of the wells (Halff & Oppenheimer 2) reached a total depth of 10,050 feet. The depths to the tops of various formations were reported by the geologists of the company to be Carrizo sand 1,260 feet, Indio formation 1,500 feet, Midway group 2,620 feet, Navarro group 3,130 feet, Taylor marl 4,850 feet, Austin chalk 5,200 feet, Buda limestone 5,710 feet, Del Rio clay 5,810 feet, Georgetown limestone 5,900 feet, Edwards limestone 5,990 feet, Qlen Eose limestone 6,791 feet, and Trinity group 9,771 feet. All the wells yielded small amounts of oil and gae from the Edwards limestone, and the well mentioned above was completed as an oil well with production from the Navarro group.

northeastern Frio County, north of Bigfoot, and in Atascosa Countyr east of Lytle, northwest of Leming, and northwest of Jourdanton. None of the faults are of sufficient magnitude to affect greatly the occurrence or movement of the ground water.
RELATION OF THE GEOLOGY TO THE GROUND-WATER CONDITIONS
SOURCE AND DISPOSAL OF THE GROUND WATER
The fundamental principles governing the occurrence and movement of ground water have been set forth in detail by Meinzer. 1* Only essential statements will be made here, and the reader is referred to Meinzer's reports for a more detailed discussion.
The ground water is derived chiefly from water that falls as rain or snow. A part of this water runs off directly in streams to the sea, a part evaporates, a part is consumed by the plants, and a part sinks to the ground-water table and enters the zone of saturation. Most of the water in the zone of saturation is eventually returned to the surface through springs or wells or is discharged by plants or through evaporation from the soil when it approaches the surface. Some water, however, percolates directly into the sea. The water table differs in altitude from place to place and fluctuates as a result of variations in rainfall, evaporation, and other climatic conditions.
The porous rocks below the water table are as a rule saturated witn water and yield water to wells sunk into them wherever the rocks are of such a texture that the water is free to move into the wells. In the more permeable rocks, such as many of the sandstones and gravel, the water is free to move under the influence of gravity, but in less permeable rocks, such as shales and fine-grained sandstones, molecular attraction tends to retard movement of the water.
GENERAL ARTESIAN CONDITIONS
The conditions governing artesian water are discussed in numerous reports of the United States Geological Survey 2 and State geological surveys and in many textbooks of geology. If a permeable stratum in an inclined position, lying between relatively impervious or watertight strata, receives water from rainfall or stream flow at its outcrop, the water entering it will move under the influence of gravity down the dip of the stratum and will tend to accumulate under hydro-

static pressure. The general conditions governing artesian water are shown in figures 2, 3, and 4. Flowing wells may be obtained where the pressure is sufficient to raise the water to the surface. Whether flowing wells can be obtained in any given locality that is underlain by an artesian stratum will depend on the difference in altitude, and the horizontal distance between that locality and the outcrop area, and also on the effectiveness of the confining beds.
In an artesian system, in general, the source of water is that entering at the outcrop of the permeable formation. The artesian system loses water through springs or other natural discharge and through wells sunk to the permeable formation. If the amount of water lost

from the artesian system in any period exceeds the recharge during the same period the head will become lower. If too many wells are sunk the head may be lowered so much that not only will the wells cease to overflow but the water will have to be raised by pumping from so great a depth that the cost of pumping may become excessive. Thus there is a limit to the economical development of any artesian system. This limit is approached or may already be exceeded if the water levels in wells become lower and lower from year to year. As overdevelopment of this kind will affect unfavorably all who use water from the artesian system, it is a subject in which all users of artesian water should be interested.

ARTESIAN CONDITIONS IN ATASCOSA AND FRIO COUNTIES
The structure of the rocks in Atascosa and Frio Counties is favorable for the occurrence of artesian water. The formations are composed largely of permeable sandstones interbedded with relatively impermeable clays and shales. Except in localities where there are notable folds or faults, the rocks dip to the south or southeast, which is also the general direction in which the land surface slopes. However, the dip is nearly everywhere steeper than the surface slope,, and therefore successively younger formations are encountered in crossing the area from north to south or from northwest to southeast. Each formation has an outcrop area from which it extends toward the south or southeast, below the younger formations, to progressively greater depths below the surface. (See pi. 1.) Thus the formations that appear at the surface in the northern part of the area shown on the map occur at depths of several thousand feet in the southeastern part the Carrizo sand, for example, reaching a depth of more than? 4,000 feet near Campbellton.
The Carrizo sand is the most productive artesian aquifer in the area, but certain sand members of the Mount Selman and CookMountain formations also furnish artesian water. The Carrizo sand possesses fairly uniform characteristics over wide areas, and the Carrizo artesian basin can therefore be accurately outlined and described. The Mount Selman and Cook Mountain formations vary considerably in lithology and stratigraphy from place to place, and the aquifers in them cannot be as accurately described as that of the Carrizo.

INDIO FORMATIONS
Areal extent. The Indio formation crops out in a small area in the vicinity of Lytle, in northwestern Atascosa County, and in the banks of the Frio River near the Hiler ranch, in northwestern Frio County (pi. 1). Only the beds in the upper part of the formation are exposed in these counties, the main outcrop area being to the north, in Medina and Bexar Counties. The formation lies unconformably beneath the Carrizo sand.
Lithology. The Indio displays the variations in lithology that are to be expected in rocks that are dominantly nonmarine. Thin-bedded sand and sandstone, clay, laminated carbonaceous shale, and lignite are characteristic of the formation. One fairly persistent sand member about 50 feet thick occurs in the lower part of the formation and crops out in Medina County. Both calcareous and siliceous concretions are common. Many of them are elongated or biscuit-shaped, and some of them reach dimensions of several feet. Some of the sandstone beds are locally indurated to quartzite. The clays are not uncommonly gypsiferous, and in many places the thin laminated shales and sands show a yellow coating of copiapite,4 a sulphate of iron. Photographs of exposures of the upper part of the formation are shown in plate 3, A and B.
Thickness and dip. The formation in Frio County is about 900 feet thick, as shown by the log of the Tribble well (no. 26, pi. 1; see p. 13), and it probably has about the same thickness in Atascosa County. The dip is variable, and there is no satisfactory means of determining it accurately. In northwestern Atascosa County dips of several degrees have been observed, but these are abnormal and related to the structure of the Somerset oil field. Well records indicate that the dip in the northern half of Atascosa County is about 110 feet to the mile. In the southeastern part of the county, however, the records of deep wells seem to indicate a somewhat greater dip. In western Atascosa County and in Frio County the dip is probably about 85 feet to the mile.
Fossil plants are abundant in the Indio formation. Marine fossils are not common but have been found in cuttings from wells in tha formation in Dimmit County and in surface exposures in Bexar and Wilson Counties.
Topography and vegetation. The topography of the outcrop area of the formation is varied, and the relief is greater than that of the outcrop areas of many of the other Eocene formations in this part of

Texas. As the formation is generally sandy with harder ledges intercalated, a rolling hilly topography has developed in places. The sandy areas of the Indio outcrop commonly support a growth of oak and other trees, but the shale areas are usually covered with chaparral.
Sections. The best surface exposures of Indio strata in Atascosa County are found southeast of Lytle, in the banks of the Atascosa River. Sections in the lignite mines in Medina County near Lytle were recorded by Dumble and are still available. These mines have been closed for many years. Other mine sections have been supplied by mine owners. A number of sections of the Indio from mines and surface exposures are given below:

Water supply. In the northern part of the area the Indio formation underlies the surface at depths that can readily be reached by wells. There are, however, only a few records of such wells available. According to A. N. Sayre, who has made an investigation of the geology and ground-water resources of Uvalde and Medina Counties, all wells in the Indio of which records were obtained in southeastern Medina County yield, small quantities of water, some of which is highly mineralized.

CABBIZO SAND 7
Areal extent. The Carrizo sand crops out in the northern parts of Atascosa and Frio Counties and the southern part of Medina County. The outcrop area increases in width from west to east. In northwestern Frio County and southwestern Medina County it is about 4 miles wide, and in northern Atascosa County about 6 to 8 miles wide (pi. 1). The formation is unconformable on the Indio formation below.
Lithology and petrography. The Carrizo sand consists almost entirely of sand but contains minor amounts of clay and lignite. The sands are on the average coarser and purer than those of any other formation in this area. The formation is generally salmon-pink, brickred, or brown where exposed in road cuts or other openings, but it may be uncolored in fresh exposures in sand pits and is generally bleached to a yellow or white in the top soil. Usually the sand is poorly cemented, with little or no matrix, and most specimens of the formation can be pulverized between the fingers. In Atascosa and Frio Counties no one portion of the formation is persistently coarser than another. Thus near the George Blackaller ranch house, in northern Frio County, the sand at the top of the formation is very coarse, but the same is true of the sand in the basal parts of the formation in other localities. Cross-bedding is highly developed in the formation. (See pis. 4, A, and 5, A.)
The sand is in general, only slightly micaceous, but nearly every specimen will yield a small amount of mica. The mica flakes are larger than those found in other Eocene formations and seem to be more abundant in Atascosa County than in Frio County. In contrast with many of the other Eocene sands the Carrizo sand is not gypsiferous nor calcareous and contains only small amounts of iron-bearing minerals. Sand from wells in the Carrizo is usually a nearly colorless sparkling aggregate of various-sized quartz grains, at once distinctive and of an attractive appearance.
7 For original description of Carrizo sand see Owen, J., Report of geologists for southern Texas: Texas Qeol. and Min. Survey First Rept. Progress, for 1888, pp. 69-74, 1889. Additional descriptions of the formation in southwestern Texas are given by Deussen, Alexander, op. cit.,pp. 56-59; Trowbridge, A.C., op. cit., pp. 52-65; Qetzendaner, F. M., op. cit., pp. 1434-1435; and Vaughan, T. W., Reconnaissance in the Bio Qrande coal fields of Texas: U. 8. Qeol. Survey Bull. 164, p. 45,1900.

Clay is present in the formation either as thin lenticular beds or as nodular lumps surrounded by sandstone. The shale lenses are seldom seen at the surface but are recorded in well records and seen in well samples. The clay lumps can be seen in every shallow pit in the Carrizo sand in Atascosa and Frio Counties. They vary from the size of a pea up to 1 foot in diameter and consist of lightgray plastic clay or sandy clay. Much of this material is bentonitic, and it is possible that the clay lumps were originally of volcanic origin. Lignite in the Carrizo has been reported from a few oil and water wells.
The Carrizo sand has been considered nonmarine. It is composed of wind-blown sand and apparently represents a fossil sand-dune area of remarkable persistence and uniformity. The shale beds are usually nonmarine and represent lagoon or lake deposits.
Petrographic analyses of Carrizo sands are given in the table below. The samples analyzed were selected to show the variations in mechanical composition. Nos. 9 to 13 represent the very coarse sand found at a number of localities: the others represent finergrained sands.

Thickness and dip. The Carrizo sand ranges in thickness from about 175 to 400 feet, according to well records, which, however, may not have been correlated with complete accuracy. The average thickness as estimated from surface exposures is about 325 feet. The dip is about 125 feet to the mile in southeastern Atascosa County, about 90 feet to the mile in central Frio County, and about 70 feet to the mile in western Frio County.
Topography and vegetation. The topography developed on the Carrizo sand is distinctive. The relief is moderately high, and the general aspect is rolling. Streams are not common, and badland features result from rains. Small sand dunes occur in some localities. The excessively sandy character of parts of the outcrop area is shown in plate 5, A. The vegetation also is distinctive. It varies somewhat from eastern Atascosa County to western Frio County because of a material difference in the amount of rainfall. In Atascosa County and eastern Frio County live oak grows on the outcrop to the exclusion of other species except for a few mesquite and some low brush. Some hint of this type of vegetation is given in the background of plate 4, J5. Between the trees the sandy soil supports a sparse growth of brush and grasses. In western Frio County the rainfall is materially lesa than in Atascosa County. Live oaks are found only near water, and the mesquite with some chaparral is dominant. The stand, however, is not dense but scattering. Consequently the area has an open parklike appearance, which is quite in contrast to that of the heavily brush-covered lands on adjacent formations. (See pi. 4, A.}
Sections. Thick exposed sections of the Carrizo sand are rare,, owing to the ease with which the formation is eroded. Exposures a few feet thick are found on the Atascosa River, in numerous sand pits, in road cuts, and along the Frio River. The best section noted isexposed in the bank of the Frio River 1 mile above the road crossing at the Woodward ranch (pi. 4, J5), where 20 to 30 feet of massive cross-bedded coarse sand unconformably overlies thinner-bedded sand containing some shale and lignitic material. These beds belong to the lower part of the formation. Two sections which also represent exposures in the lower part of the formation are given below. The character of the fonnation as revealed in wells is shown in the welL logs on pages 81-87.

Many of the pits opened for road materials in Atascosa and Frio Counties afford excellent exposures of the Carrizo. The pits are shallow, as only the weathered surface sand is removed, the more firmly cemented, unweathered rock being left undisturbed. A pit on the Palo Alto road 2 miles south of the railroad crossing near Tarbutton, Atascosa County, is typical. Here a surface 100 by 100 feet is exposed in which the vertical range is not more than 18 inches. The predominating rock is a cross-bedded coarse salmon-pink sand containing irregular lumplike masses of light blue-gray sandy clay and interbedded with small amounts of flaggy to shaly sandstone. The coarse sand is loosely cemented. It shows small areas in which the quartz grains reach a maximum size of 4 millimeters, and it contains mica hi large flakes. Thin layers of fine-grained light-gray sandstone are also exposed.
Well logs. Logs of several wells that penetrate the Carrizb sand are given in the table on pages 81-87. Some of these logs are incomplete, the record of formations encountered below the Carrizo sand being omitted. A few of the logs are briefly discussed below.

162. This well is in northwestern Atascosa County 4 miles west of Rossville. It was drilled near the south boundary of the outcrop of the Carrizo sand and passed completely through it. The Carrizo is represented in the record from 83 to 485 feet, and consists entirely of sand and sandstone of variable degree of coherency. The beds encountered below 485 feet belong to the Indio formation and are composed chiefly of alternating shale and sandstone. The total depth of this well, an oil test, was 4,080 feet.
241. This well is in north-central Atascosa County 1% miles north of Pleasanton. It gives a nearly complete section of the Mount Selman formation, as it was drilled at a point near the top of this formation. The Carrizo sand is shown frpm

26 GROUND WATER OF ATASCOSA AND FRIO COUNTIES, TEX.
1,200 to 1,515 feet. Here also the formation is seen to consist almost entirely of sand.
300. This well is in north-central Atascosa County, 2 miles southeast of Pleasanton, about 4 miles southeast of well 241. The Carrizo sand was encountered at 1,419 to 1,722 feet considerably-deeper than in well 241. The well had a total depth of 1,722 feet. Coal was encountered at the bottom of the well, perhaps in the Indio formation but probably in the Carrizo sand, an occurrence not unknown elsewhere.
107. This well is in southern Frio County, 1% miles southwest of Derby. The first bed encountered in the well below surficial deposits belongs to a horizon estimated as about 100 feet below the top of the Mount Selman formation. The beds penetrated between 1,469 and 1,709 feet presumably belong to the Carrizo sand, and the shale and rock at the bottom of the well, between 1,709 and 1,760 feet may be Indio, but this is not certain. The beds logged above the Carrizo sand probably belong in part to the Bigford member of the Mount Selman formation, but the boundary between the formations is not shown.
26. An oil test well in northeastern Frio County, 6 miles northeast of Moore. This well was carefully drilled, and numerous cores were taken in the course of the drilling. The record is therefore very valuable as a basis for correlation of the many formations encountered. The Carrizo is present from 37 to 212 feet and consists largely of sand with two strata of lignite.
3. This well is in northwestern Frio County, 3 miles north of Frio Town. It was an oil test well and was drilled through the Carrizo sand into lower formations. The Carrizo was found from 65 to 248 feet and consisted largely of sand and sandstone. The well was drilled near the Carrizo-Bigford contact and passed through 65 feet of Bigford strata.
155. This well is in north-central Frio County, 4 miles southeast of Moore. It was drilled to a depth of 1,978 feet in an effort to obtain a flowing well. The beds between 530 and 931 feet, consisting of sand and sandstone, belong to the Carrizo.
22. This well is in north-central Frio County, about 3 miles southwest of Moore and \% miles northwest of well 155 and was an oil test. The Carrizo sand was encountered in it between 498 and 880 feet, and the beds correspond closely in thickness and character with those found in well 155.
The logs on pages 81-87 give some idea of the variations in thickness and character of the Carrizo sand in different parts of the area. The thickness according to the well drillers ranges from 175 to 402 feet. In general the formation thickens down the dip and from west to east along the strike. The formation is composed dominantly of sand but contains thin beds of shale and lignite. Coarse white sands yield water most freely to wells.
Water supply. The Carrizo sand, itself very permeable, is underlain by clay and shales of the Indio formation and overlain by clay of the Mount Selman formation. In the western part of Frio County the basal or Bigford member of the Mount Selman overlies the Carrizo, but farther east the Bigford has not been differentiated and the overlying beds are classed simply as Mount Selman. Partly as a result of this arrangement, water in the Carrizo sand is everywhere under artesian pressure except on the outcrop, and over a wide extent of territory the pressure is sufficient to bring the water to the surface.

The maps show the outcrop of the Carrizo sand, the depths to the sand in localities south of the outcrop, the heights to which the water from the sand will rise, and the areas in which flowing wells can be obtained by drilling into it. Everywhere south or southeast of the outcrop the formation is encountered by wells but at greater and greater depths with increasing distance from the outcrop. The increase in the depth to the sand toward the south and southeast and the altitude above sea level to which water in the Carrizo sand would rise in 1930 are shown on plate 2. From this map it can be seen that the formation dips fairly uniformly away from the outcrop. The boundaries of the areas having the same range in depth are based on well records in which the Carrizo can be identified.
On the putcrop area water is obtained in wells at depths generally slightly more than 100 feet. These wells yield abundant supplies of water for domestic purposes. The water is essentially not under pressure in the outcrop area, because the upper surface of the saturated part of the formation is in permeable sand, where it forms a water table. A list of measured or estimated depths to the Carrizo sand in different parts of the area is given below.

Area of artesian flow. The areas in which flowing wells may be obtained from the Carrizo sand are shown on plate 1. The north boundary of the area follows more or less closely the contours of surface altitude, and in the northern part of the area the flowing-well territory is restricted to the valleys. From plate 2 it is possible to determine for any Ideality both, the approximate depth at which a well will encounter the Carrizo sand and the approximate altitude above sea level to which water in the well will rise.

dissolved solids is generally less than 500 parts per million, except in the water drawn from the deeper wells, in which the total amount is generally less than 600 parts per million. Some of the samples from wells near the outcrop were unusually pure, containing less than 200 parts per million of total dissolved solids. The Carrizo waters generally contain some iron.

MOUNT SELMAN FORMATION 8

0

In this report the Mount Selman formation is described in two sections, one on the basal or Bigford member and the other on the remainder of the formation. In previous reports the Bigford deposits have been treated as a distinct formation and included in the Wiicox group, but because of the accumulating evidence that they are of Claiborne age, they are here treated as a local member of the Mount Selman formation, with which they are included on the geologic map of Texas published in 1932. They are considered by Julia Gardner to be contemporaneous with but not exactly equivalent to the Reklaw of eastern Texas, from which they differ lithologically and with which they are not directly connected.

BIGFORD MEMBER»
General features. The Bigford member of the Mount Selman formation crops out in northern Frio County. Its outcrop area is shown on plate 1 as extending from the west boundary of the county eastward t'o the International-Great Northern Railroad near Moore. Farther east the presence of the member is problematic, but in northeastern Frio County and in northern Atascosa County beds that are similar lithologically to those of the Bigford in other localities crop out and may belong to the member. Getzendaner 10 has stated that the Bigford is present as far east as Bigfoot, in northeastern Frio County. This statement is based on the presence of a sandstone (the Mills bed of Getzendaner), which has been definitely identified by the writer as far east in Frio County as Seco Creek. Somewhat similar sandstones occur in the Mount Selman formation in north-central Frio County, and it is felt that insufficient detailed work has been done to be certain of the correlation of the formations around Bigfoot. Accordingly east of the International-Great Northern Railroad the Bigford member is not differentiated from the rest of the Mount Selman, and statements with regard to water-supply conditions mention only the Mount Selman. The line of separation

between the Bigford member and the rest of the Mount Selman is drawn with difficulty because of similar lithologic character.
Lithology. The Bigford is composed dominantly of dark to buff clays with thin sandstones and thin limestones, a small amount of volcanic ash, and impure lignite. Calcareous concretions are common and form good markers for the lower part of the member. The Mills bed of Getzendaner is an especially distinctive bed of the member in Zavala County and the western part of Frio County. It is unlike other sandstones in the Bigford member, though similar to certain local sandstones in the overlying beds of the Mount Selman. It is a fine-grained noncalcareous, fairly well cemented sandstone, grayish white, but showing pink, lavender, and purplish tints in hand specimens. It carries an abundance of plant remains, both leaves and stems. The stems are usually about a quarter of an inch in diameter and resemble sedges. Good outcrops of this bed are found along the Bigford escarpment in northern Frio County.
Thickness. The thickness of the Bigford member is variable. It is difficult to recognize the member in well records. In western Frio County it is probably 300 feet thick, but it may pinch out toward the east.
Paleontology. Fossils, except plants, are not abundant in the Bigford. Poorly preserved oysters and various mollusks are occasionally found, but no guide fossils for the member have yet been described.
Topography and vegetation. The outcrop area of the upper part of the Bigford member is one of moderate relief, but in that of the basal part the relief is commonly stronger. In the basal part of the section resistant sandstones are present and form northward-facing escarpments. These are especially well developed in northern Frio County on the John J. Little ranch. The vegetation is the common assemblage of chaparral but is usually thicker than that on either the Carrizo or the overlying beds of the Mount Selman formation.
Water supply. The Bigford member does not yield much water to wells, and the water is in general highly mineralized.

POST-BIGFOKD BEDS
Areal extent. The post-Bigford part of the Mount Selman formation crops out in a belt of variable width extending across both Atascosa and Frio Counties. (See pi. 1.) It rests unconformably on either the Bigford member or the Carrizo sand and is conformable beneath the Cook Mountain formation.
Lithology and petrography. The beds are composed of gray, brown, and yellow sandstone, white, yellow, and brown clay, lignite, concretions of limonite and limestone, gypsum, altered volcanic ash, and small amounts of glauconite. The lignite beds are not important

30 GROUND WATER OP ATASCOSA AND FRIO COUNTIES, TEX.
commercially in Atascosa and Frio Counties, though some mining of them has been attempted in the past. In Frio County the beds are divisible into a lower clay member and an upper sand member, but their character changes along the strike, and in Atascosa County they consist largely of alternating sand and clay beds. The sandstones are usually lenticular and are in many places indurated to quartzites. However, east of Pearsall rather persistent beds of sandstone are found in the upper part of the formation. (See pi. 5, B.} Some of the sandstone beds resemble fairly closely the Mills bed of Getzendaner in the Bigford member. These are found 4 miles east of Pearsall on the Charlotte road, near Navarro School in Atascosa County, and at other places. Altered volcanic ash is also present in the lower part of the beds. Exposures of this material are found 4 miles east of Pearsall and east of Leming. Glauconitic beds occur in the lower part and are usually marked by highly ferruginous outcrops and soils. Plate 6, A, shows alternating sandstones and shaly sandstones in the lower part of the beds.

Thickness. The post-Bigford beds vary in thickness along both the strike and the dip. The average thickness as determined from the outcrops in Atascosa and Frio Counties is probably around 700 feet, but a much greater thickness is indicated in wells. At Pearsall the top of the Carrizo is found at a depth of 1,134 feet in wells. Even after allowing for dip and the presence of the Bigford member, there still must be as much as 900 feet of post-Bigford Mount Selman beds in the wells. Even greater thicknesses are shown in records of wells farther down the dip.
Paleontology. Fossils of Claiborne age are sometimes found in the post-Bigford beds of the Mount Selman formation but are not abundant. Deussen u has listed Venericardia planicosta Lamarck, Plejona petrosa Conrad, and Cornulina armigera (Conrad). Trowbridge 12 added to this list Cytherea sp., Protocardia sp., and a number of plant fossils.
Topography and vegetation. The outcrop area exhibits a moderately well developed relief. On clayey parts of the formation the country is rather monotonously level, but on the upper part, which contains resistant sandstones, the topography is marked by numerous isolated hills. These are seen southeast of Pearsall and in much of northwestern Frio County. The vegetation is chaparral not greatly different from that developed on the Bigford member.
Sections. Sections of the post-Bigford part of the Mount Selman formation are given below.

Well logs. The logs of four wells in the Mount Selman formation are given in the table of well logs on pages 81-87 and are briefly discussed below.
The logs of the high school well (no. 64), at Pearsall, and the H. H. Page well (no. 40), \% miles north of Pearsall, illustrate the stratigraphy in the vicinity of Pearsall, where there is considerable irrigation. The greater part of the irrigation wells are about 100 feet deep and encounter water sand at depths ranging from 65 to 85 feet. The water is under small artesian pressure and rises slightly above the top of the water sand. The high school and several other wells have been drilled to depths around 200 feet. Such wells generally failed to find an adequate supply of water at the upper horizon and were carried on down. It appears that the water sand supplying the shallow wells is restricted to a small area and is present as a lens with greatest thickness north and northeast of the town. Wells put down farther east and in localities south of Pearsall, though finding sands at comparatively shallow depths, have not yielded adequate supplies for irrigation.
The Oppenheimer & Lang well (no. 83) is in the valley of San Miguel Creek east of Pearsall. The well was started near the top of the Mount Selman formation. In a total depth of 860 feet 7 water-bearing sands were found, and the 2 lower ones furnished flowing water. Of the upper 330 feet 242 feet was composed of beds of a sandy nature, if not of pure sand.
The C. S. Young well (no. 251) started in the Cook Mountain formation and was drilled nearly to the Carrizo sand. The beds between 338 and 1,428 feet, composed of alternating sandstones and shale or gumbo, have been identified as Mount Selman. Water sands were encountered at depths of 745 to 760, 810 to 820, 931 to 951, 1,113 to 1,155, and 1,188 to 1,210 feet. The well indicates the character of the geologic section around Pleasanton, where there are many artesian wells in the Mount Selman formation ranging in depth from 300 to 850 feet.
Water supply. Usually several water-bearing sandstones are encountered by wells in the post-Bigford part of the Mount Selman

COOK MOUNTAIN FORMATION

35

formation. These sandstones are interbedded with clays, and the water in them is under artesian pressure except in localities where they appear at the surface. As the stratigraphy of the formation is not constant over large areas the artesian strata are not continuous. The upper half of the formation contains more sand than the lower half, and in parts of the area it is an important source of water. Most of the artesian water thus far developed from the Mount Selman comes from the upper part of the formation. Thinner beds in the lower part ordinarily yield artesian water of poorer quality and in smaller amounts. A few wells in Atascosa County, however, yield large flows from the lower part.
Areas of artesian flow. Plate 1 shows the area in which flows can be obtained from wells in the Mount Selman formation. This area is in the south-central and southeastern parts of Frio County and the south-central and southwestern parts of Atascosa County. For much of the southern and southeastern parts of Atascosa County the available data are incomplete, and it is possible to give only a general outline of the artesian area.
Chemical character of the water. The waters in the Mount Selman formation have considerable range in chemical composition. The variations within the formation are in part directly related to the horizon from which the water is drawn and in part to the depth of the wells. Some of the wells are doubtless subject to inflow of water from the overlying Cook Mountain or Yegua formation, and this affects the chemical character of the water. The post-Bigford part of the Mount Selman varies lithologically along both the strike and the dip. The water obtained from the upper sandy beds is generally suitable for domestic use, and some of it is suitable for irrigation. The lower beds contain a relatively larger amount of clay, with alternating thin sand beds. The water from the lower clayey beds is generally of poorer quality, and much of it is not suitable for any use.
The shallow water near Pearsall and in the sandy areas east and south of Pearsall is generally of good quality, containing chloride and sulphate, with relatively small amounts of sodium carbonate and sodium chloride.
COOK MOUNTAIN FORMATION 13
AreaL extent. The Cook Mountain formation crops out in Atascosa and Frio Counties in a belt whose entire width lies within the two counties. The line of contact between the Cook Mountain formation and the underlying Mount Selman formation enters Atascosa County south of Verdi and passes south of Pleasanton, \% miles north of Charlotte, and through the Keystone ranch, in Frio County. It crosses the Frio River southeast of Derby and thence passes westward
11 For original description see Kennedy, William, op. cit., pp. 54-57. Additional descriptions of the formation in southwestern Texas are given by Deussen, Alexander, op. cit., pp. 64-75, and Trowbridge, A. O., op. cit., pp. 104-129.

36 GROUND WATER OF ATASCOSA AND FRIO COUNTIES, TEX.
to the Zavala County line. (See pi. 1.) Collections of fossils from certain localities north of the Leona River in Frio County were identified as Cook Mountain by Julia Gardner. These localities are isolated outliers of the Cook Mountain and are not shown on plate 1. Such exposures are due to an anticline or nose present in this region, and most of them are on its north flank, some of them exhibiting north or reverse dip.13a At a point 3K miles northeast of the Corey ranch about 60 feet of Cook Mountain beds are present with a dip of more than 2° N. This locality is highly fossiliferous. Directly south of the locality along the Leona River typical Mount Selman sand i& exposed. Other Cook Mountain localities north of the Leona include Catarina Hill, Oyster Hill on the Loxton ranch, and the English Hills, in all of which the Cook Mountain strata cap the hills. Cook Mountain rocks are probably present on Berry Creek southwest of the Loxton ranch and on Little Yoledigo Creek southeast of the Taylor ranch. The formation is conformable both above and below.
Lithology and petrography. The formation consists of sandstone, gypsiferous clay, impure limestone, and lignite. Much of the sandstone is glauconitic and contains considerable quantities of cone-incone concretions. The formation varies considerably in lithologic character along the strike. In eastern Atascosa County it consists largely of alternating beds of gypsiferous clay and glauconitic sandstone, with boulders of fossiliferous indurated calcareous sandstone. West of the general region of Pleasanton the lower part of the formation consists largely of glauconitic sandstone, in many places fossiliferous, with only a little clay. The greatest development of the basal glauconitic sandstone is in Frio County, where all of the Cook Mountain area except the southeast corner of the county is underlain by this rock. To the east the area underlain by the basal sandstone becomes progressively narrower until the sandstone is no longer observable near Pleasanton. Its absence east of Pleasanton is probably due to overlap or a gradation of the sandstone into the alternating clay and sandstone section above. In areas underlain by the sandstone brick-red loamy soils are developed, but where clay is the predominant constituent the formation produces black soils.
The contact of the formation with the Mount Selman in western Atascosa County is obscured by large areas of loose sand. Banks Hill, just west of the county boundary, and another area near Tobey are probably outliers of the formation and are not shown on the map.
The sandstones of the formation are generally glauconitic, though some samples are entirely free from glauconite. In some exposures the glauconitic material is calcareous and takes the character of an impure marly limestone. Petrographic analyses of sands from the formation are given below.

Thickness and dip. The thickness of the Cook Mountain formation ranges from 600 to 900 feet; the maximum thickness is found in wells. The beds dip southeastward at an average rate of about 115 feet to the mile.
Paleontology. Fossils are very abundant in the formation. These are found in lenses and ledges of impure glauconitic limestone which are scattered through the formation. Detailed lists of fossils of the formation have been given by both Deussen 14 and Trowbridge 15 and are not repeated here.
Topography and vegetation. The topographic expression of the Cook Mountain outcrop area varies with the lithology. The areas underlain by sandstone are generally rolling and have moderate relief; the less sandy parts of the formation are also rolling but have slight relief. A considerable part of the formation is sandy, and its outcrop area commonly supports open chaparral brush with scattered large live oaks. Mesquites are generally larger than those growing on other formations.
Sections. Many small sections of the Cook Mountain formation are found throughout the area, although, in general, the formation is better exposed in Atascosa County than in Frio County. Sections from three localities in Atascosa County are given below.

40 GROUND WATER OP ATASCOSA AND FRIO COUNTIES, TEX.
A part of the section on the Bluntzer road is shown in plate 6, B. An exposure of clay with calcareous concretions from the middle part of the formation is shown in plate 7, A.
No good sections of the upper part of the formation are exposed in this area. In the Dilley region, southwestern Frio County, many small exposures of the upper part of the formation are found in road cuts and on hills. The predominant rock type is a brick-red sandstone containing weathered glauconite and yielding a reddish sandy-loam soil. Throughout this area thin concretionary limestone beds are also found and are usually fossiliferous. The log of the C. M. Kelley well (p. 84) shows the character of the upper part of the formation as disclosed by well cuttings.
Well logs. Logs of wells in the Cook Mountain formation in parts of the area were obtained, including the log of the C. M. Kelley well, near Hindes, 2,390 feet deep, and logs of three wells 280 to 370 feet deep near Dilley. Unfortunately few logs of wells in the formation are available except in the Dilley area.
The C. M. Kelley well (no. 114) is in extreme southeastern Frio County. It starts near the top of the Cook Mountain formation and penetrates to the Carrizo sand. The Mount Selman contact in this well is believed to be at 965 feet, but its correct location is somewhat problematic. The formation is composed of sand, clay, sandstone, and limestone. The sands penetrated by the well between 373 and 433 feet supply the shallow flowing wells at Hindes, and sands at the same horizon but at greater depths probably supply wells near Christine. The bottom of the formation is not notably sandy, and the most sandy facies of the lower part of the Cook Mountain are found in western Frio County.
The logs of wells near Dilley (nos. 122, 133, and 136) show the character of the Cook Mountain water-bearing sands in western Frio County. According to these and other available logs the sands range from 115 to 344 feet in thickness. It is possible that some of the extreme thicknesses recorded may represent beds that are generally sandy and water-bearing but contain minor amounts of clay or shale. The records indicate quite plainly, however, that there is a thick sand member at the base of the Cook Mountain near Dilley, which thickens to the southeast.
Water supply. The water-bearing sands of the Cook Mountain formation are generally not continuous nor very thick, and in these respects they are comparable with the sands in the Mount Selman formation. The thickest and most persistent sands are in the lower half of the formation, and it is from these sands that most of the water is obtained. The water is usually under some artesian pressure, and a few flowing wells have been obtained in Atascosa County, but in most places the wells do not flow.
Irrigation has been developed with water pumped from wells in this formation in an area around Dilley, in Frio County. The largest pumped wells and the lands irrigated from them, together with flowing wells in the formation in Atascosa County on which reliable data were obtained, are shown on plate 1.

YEGUA FORMATION

41

Chemical character of the water. The water from the Cook Mountain formation is variable in character, but on the whole it is highly mineralized. The lower sandy portions of the formation yield the best water, some of which is suitable for domestic use and for irrigation on sandy soils with good drainage. It is difficult to find suitable water for domestic use in the upper clayey parts of the formation. Much of this water is very high in dissolved solids and is objectionable to the taste.
YEGUA FORMATION'"
Areal eyctent. The Yegua formation crops out in the extreme southeastern part of Frio County and in a belt several miles wide in Atascosa County extending from the vicinity of Hindes, on the southeast, through Christine to McCoy and on to the east boundary of the county. (See pi. 1.) In some previous reports on eastern Texas this formation has been called the fCockfield formation,17 but that name has now been dropped.
Lithology. The formation is composed almost entirely of gray to yellowish or light-brown clay. Some slightly sandy clay, lignite, gypsum, limestone, and limestone concretions are also found. The gypsum is rather uniformly distributed through the clay as small crystals and grains of selenite. Lignite is present in beds that range from thin seams to beds of commercial thickness. The limestone concretions are yellowish and composed of dense compact limestone with a few veins of calcite. Cone-in-cone concretions in minor amounts are also found. The clays as a whole are carbonaceous, giving brown to blackish stains and seams in nearly every exposure.
Thickness and dip. The Yegua formation is variable in thickness. In the outcrop area it is probably not more than 700 feet thick, but the logs of wells indicate that down the dip it is materially thicker. It has an average dip of about 150 feet to the mile.
Paleontology. Fossils are not abundant in the formation, but occasionally large oysters are found.
Topography and vegetation. The outcrop area of the Yegua is one of little relief. The topography is therefore in some contrast to that of the Cook Mountain below and the Jackson above, in which considerable relief is common. Seen from any higher point the country underlain by the Yegua appears as nearly a plain cut by shallow stream valleys. Drainage on the whole is poor, and marshy lands are not uncommon.
The vegetation is less prolific than that of the overlying and underlying formations, though partaking of the same general character.

42 GROUND WATER OF ATASCOSA AND FRIO COUNTIES, TEX.

Oaks are practically absent; mesquite and pricklypear are abundant but do not occur in dense thickets. The soils are generally deep and black, with scattered buff or reddish-buff areas.
Sections. Few exposures of Yegua showing a greater vertical range than a few feet were found. Stream banks and road cuts yield the best exposures, and these indicate that the beds do not vary greatly in character from the bottom of the formation to the top. Sections near the base of the formation along the Pleasanton-Campbellton highway show typical brown gypsiferous clay with yellow concretions and some cone-in-cone structure. Similar exposures are found on the road from Jourdanton to Christine.
The best exposures are found along the Atascosa River for several miles above McCoy. These show only slight variation but are typical of the formation.

This section shows the contact between the Cook Mountain and Yegua. The greensand probably represents the top of the Cook Mountain formation.
The thickest lignite beds are found near the top of the formation. Northwest of Campbellton test pits showed several feet of the material over a considerable area. Just south of the Atascosa County line, near Cross Settlement, south of Christine, 15 feet of lignite is exposed in the bank of San Miguel Creek.
Chemical character of the water. Most of the water from the Yegua formation is so highly mineralized that it is unsuitable for either domestic use or irrigation, though a few wells supply water that can be used. Most of the water is even unsuitable for livestock, as the stock generally refuse to drink it. Throughout the outcrop area of this formation domestic water supplies are obtained by storing rain water in cisterns or metal tanks.

Areal extent. The Jackson formation appears at the surface only in southeastern and southern Atascosa County. The lower boundary line passes north of Fashing, north of Campbellton, and out of the county near Cross Settlement, in northern McMullen County. (See pi. 1.) None of the larger towns are located on the Jackson, and the area of outcrop is largely ranch country with minor amounts of farm land. The formation lies conformably on the Yegua formation and unconformably beneath the Catahoula tuff, which has overlapped the Frio clay.
Lithology and petrography. The Jackson is composed of sandstone, quartzite, sandy clay, and volcanic ash. Much of the clay is carbonaceous or lignitic and hence chocolate-colored. The sandstone is generally gray to white, but a few beds are darker and weather to reddish soils. Many of the sandstones are thin-bedded. The beds of volcanic ash range from buff to white and are of variable thickness, the maximum being about 15 feet. They are usually partly altered to clay materials. The formation abounds in silicified wood and contains both calcareous and siliceous concretions, some of the former with cone-in-cone structure. Petrographic analyses of Jackson sands are given below.
18 In former reports and maps issued by the U. 8. Geological Survey all beds of Jackson (upper Eocene) age in Texas were included in the Fayette sandstone. It is now recognized that the beds of Jackson age in this State cannot all be appropriately assigned to the Fayette. For this reason the Survey has recently substituted Jackson formation for the beds of Jackson age in Atascosa, Prio, and other counties in southern Texas.

45

Thickness and dip. In Atascosa County the Jackson formation is about 450 feet thick, with some variation from place to place. The dip averages about 120 feet to the mile, but southeast of Campbellton much higher dips, due to local structural modifications, were observed.
Fossils. The Jackson formation is locally fossiliferous. Many of the platy or flaggy sandstones of the lower part of the formation abound in fossils. The number of species is not great, but these are frequently present in great abundance. No detailed paleontologic studies of these fossils have been published, though Ostrea georgiana Conrad is commonly listed as a characteristic form. Fossil plants are likewise abundant in the formation.1821
Topography and vegetation. The outcrop of resistant sandstone beds in the lower part of the formation is marked by a prominent escarpment or line of hills which is seen south of Campbellton and can be traced across Atascosa County (pi. 7, B). The extreme lower and upper parts of the formation are composed of softer beds, and where these appear at the surface the country is a rather featureless plain. The vegetation on the outcrop does not differ materially from that found on outcrop areas of adjacent formations.
Sections. Excellent sections of the entire Jackson formation are found in southeastern Atascosa County. Some of the sections are given below.

Water supply. The water from the Jackson formation is variable in chemical quality. The sandstone from the lower part of the formation yields considerable quantities of water, some of which is suitable for use, but the higher beds generally yield water that is highly mineralized and is frequently unsuitable for use.

CATAHOULA TUFF lfl

The Catahoula tuff crops out in extreme southeastern Ataseosa County, where it covers an area of about 2 square miles. It consists of creamy-gray volcanic tuff and fine tuffaceous sandstone. The thick-
's In accordance with present usage the term "Catahoula tuff" is applied to the dominantly volcanic series of tuffs, tuffaceous sandstones, and conglomerates overlying the Frio clay in southern Texas.

GROUND WATER OF ATASCOSA AND FRIO COUNTIES, TEX. 47
ness exposed in Atascosa County is not more than 100 feet, and the formation does not enter into the problems of water supply.
The Catahoula lies on the Jackson formation, the Frio clay having been overlapped.
GOLIAD SAND
The Goliad sand in this area is composed largely of gravel and cobbles of various kinds, with some sand and caliche. Outcrops of the formation, all of them only a few feet thick, are found sparingly southwest of Charlotte, in southwestern Atascosa County, and rather abundantly throughout Frio County. All the exposures occur on high interstream areas. The formation is not a source of water supply in Atascosa and Frio Counties and is not shown on plate 1. It is probably of Pliocene age.
LEONA FORMATION
In the valley of the Frio River, in northern Frio County, are terrace materials consisting of buff to gray silt, with minor lenses of sand or gravel, that are believed to belong to the Leona formation, of Pleistocene age. Occasional steep faces show as much as 35 feet of the material. The formation, however, is found in only small areas and is not a source of water supply.
ALLUVIUM
The stream valleys of Atascosa and Frio Counties contain Recent alluvial deposits of sand and silt, which are restricted to very narrow areas and are not of consequence as sources of water.
SANDSTONE DIKES
Two sandstone dikes are known to occur in the area one on the E. J. Pruitt farm, 5 miles west of Charlotte, Atascosa County, on the west side of Lagunillas Creek, and the other 8^ miles east of Pearsall, Frio County, just south of the Pearsall-Charlotte road, on the west side of Black Creek.
The dike in Atascosa County crops out on the surface as a rudely wall-like mass 70 feet long and 30 feet wide with a strike of N. 52° E. It stands about 8 feet above the general land surface. Another outcrop of the same mass occurs 100 yards to the southwest, where the character is the same. The dike is jointed at right angles to the strike. The rock composing the dike is ferruginous medium- to coarse-grained well-cemented sandstone.
The dike in Frio County crops out as a wall 30 to 35 feet wide and 70 feet long. The strike is N. 34° E. The general character of the material is the same as that of the dike in Atascosa County except that the ferruginous sandstone contains numerous rounded cobbles

48 GROUND WATER OF ATASCOSA AND FRIO COUNTIES, TEX.
and pebbles of chert as much as 6 inches in diameter. In parts of the rock these are the major constituents, and the rock is therefore a conglomerate. These cobbles are identical with those of the Goliad formation and probably have come from the same source. It is also likely that the materials for the dike were supplied from the erosion of Goliad gravel.
So far as can be told from the exposures near the dikes, they were not formed after faulting had opened crevices in the surface of the earth. It seems evident from the nature of the dikes that they were formed by the filling of crevices or cracks with detrital material. The structural details, however, are not available.
IRRIGATION FROM WELLS
IRRIGATION FROM WELLS IN CARRIZO SAND
General conditions. Wells in the Carrizo sand yield abundant supplies of water for irrigation and for municipal and domestic use. The intensive development for irrigation is restricted mainly to relatively small tracts in the Frio Valley, in Frio County, and in the general locality of Poteet and Pleasanton, in Atascosa County (pi. 1). A few wells in the Carrizo sand in other parts of the area are also used for irrigation.
Frio Valley area. Irrigation from wells in the Carrizo sand in Frio County has thus far been confined for the most part to relatively small tracts southwest of Pearsall. (See pi. 1.) The first Carrizo sand well in this area was drilled in 1905 by Halff & Oppenheimer and was a flowing well. Since that time 12 additional wells have been drilled to the Carrizo in the area for irrigation use and 2 have been drilled in Pearsall for municipal supply. All the wells once overflowed, except the municipal wells at Pearsall and the Weissinger well (no. 96), 1 mile southwest of Pearsall, but by the fall of 1929 four of them had ceased to flow. During the spring of 1930, because of unusually heavy rainfall, little water was used for irrigation. As a result, the water levels in the nonflowing wells rose perceptibly, and one well began to overflow again.
With one or two exceptions all the wells are pumped, the flowing wells being equipped with pumps so as to increase the yield of water during periods when the demands for irrigation are heaviest. When the wells in the lower (southerly) part of the area are pumped continuously or allowed to flow continuously the static level in the wells in the upper (northerly) part of the area is lowered and the yield of the wells is decreased somewhat. All the flowing wells have declined somewhat in yield since they were drilled, the lowest (most southerly) wells showing the smallest decrease. The most productive well in the area is the Bennett well, \% miles south of Derby (no. 109). This well had a natural flow of 896 gallons a minute in 1928, according to a measurement by C. E. Ellsworth, of the United States Geological Survey. It yields about 2,000 gallons a minute when pumped. For many years the static level in the well stood at about 32 feet above the surface of the ground. In the pumping season of 1928-29 the well with others in the area was used intensively, and the level fell to only 12 feet above the surface. The level had risen to about 20 feet during the summer of 1930, when little water was used for irrigation. The Mills well (no. 106), 2% miles west of Derby, is also

IRRIGATION FROM WELLS

49

very productive, yielding about 800 gallons a minute. The static level in this well was 28 feet above the surface during the summer of 1930.
The water from these wells is used mostly for irrigating vegetables, especially onions, spinach, and tomatoes. There is some irrigation of cotton and corn, but during many seasons it is not necessary to irrigate these crops. In general two crops are raised on each tract of land during the year, one in summer and one in winter, and rotation of crops is employed so far as is practicable. The duty of water is variable and depends on the character of the crop and the rainfall during the growing season and to some extent on the skill of the individual farmer. For any crop the practice is to irrigate profusely until the crop is started and then to irrigate at intervals as needed to keep the plants growing vigorously in dry times. Accordingly much more water is used if the growing season is dry than if rains occur frequently.
Poteet-Pleasanton area. The largest area irrigated from wells in the Carrizo sand in Atascosa County is in the northern part of the county around Poteet and Pleasanton. The development thus far has been restricted generally to the lower lands in the Atascosa River Valley, but a few wells have been put down on higher lands some distance from the stream. The northernmost well in this district is 5 miles west of Poteet, and the southernmost is 3 miles southeast of Pleasanton. The area thus defined is 12 miles in length but only 2 or 3 miles wide. The development of irrigation in this area is not continuous and is most intensive near Poteet. (See pi. 1.)
The wells range in depth from less than 500 feet in the northern part of this area to more than 1,600 feet in the southern part. The long dimension of the area nearly coincides with the direction of the dip of the Carrizo sand, and this accounts for the comparatively great range in the depth of the wells. In the immediate vicinity of Poteet there are more than 50 wells that are supplied by the Carrizo sand. Many of these wells are used for irrigation, but at any given time there are always many wells not being used because of change in ownership, tenancy, or agricultural conditions. Most of the wells flow, and about one-fifth of them are allowed to flow continuously. Wells near the northerly limits of the area do not flow at present, though most of them flowed originally. The artesian head in the Carrizo sandstone in the area has fallen about 25 feet since the first well was drilled, and at Poteet it is now about 500 feet above sea level.
The yield of the wells in the area by natural overflow varies considerably, according to the location of the well and the size of the casing. The average flow in the vicinity of Poteet is probably less than 200 gallons a minute. Wells in the lower (southerly) part of the area for example, the Cunningham & Taliaferro well, 2 miles southeast of Pleasanton (no. 300), and the Anderson & Arneson well, 1 mile northeast of Jourdanton (no. 249) have estimated yields ranging from 450 to 650 gallons a minute. Many of the wells in the northerly part of the area are equipped with pumps. About half of the pumping plants consist of turbine or centrifugal pumps driven by electric motors, but air-compressor plants and gasoline motors- of several types are also used.
Irrigated tracts in this area are largely devoted to truck raising. The area is most widely known for its strawberries, to which the sandy soil is well adapted and for which high prices are commonly received. The first berries reach the market late in November or early in December, but the bulk of the crop is shipped in January, February, and March. Onions, spinach, beans, and other truck crops are also raised, and a few tracts of nursery land are irrigated. The duty of water varies materially according to the crop raised, the rainfall during the irrigation season, and the care with which the water is applied to the land.
Other areas. Wells in the Carrizo sand are used for irrigation in other parts of the area. The well of C. M. Kelley, west of Hindes, supplies water for irrigation.

50 GROUND WATER OF ATASCOSA AND FRIO COUNTIES, TEX.
The well is 2,390 feet deep and flows about 600 gallons a minute. The Blesse well (no. 112), 1 mile southwest of Dilley, is also used for irrigation.
In the San Miguel Valley, in Frio County, several wells have been drilled to the Carrizo sand, but these wells were not used for irrigation in 1929 and 1930. The J. E. Berry well (no. 24), 4% miles southeast of Moore, is the northernmost well in this area. It is 700 feet deep, and the water stands within 10 feet of the surface. Flowing wells of large yields at the Keystone ranch headquarters (no. 110) and the McGowen ranch headquarters (no. Ill) derive their water supplies from the Carrizo sand. These wells are used for domestic supply and for stock. '
IRRIGATION PROM WELLS IN MOUNT SELMAN FORMATION
Water from the Mount Sslman formation is used to some extent for irrigation, mainly around Pearsall and in east-central Atascosa County. It is most widely used, however, for stock and domestic supply.
Pearsall area. The first attempt at irrigation with water from the Mount Selman formation in the Pearsall area was in 1902, when a shallow well was drilled 1 mile north of the town. This well demonstrated that in this locality sands at comparatively shallow depths would yield sufficient water for irrigation, and soon after it was put down other wells were sunk for the same purpose, and the development has continued until the present time. The wells are from 100 to 200 feet deep and do not flow. The average pumping yield is not large, and the tracts irrigated from the wells are comparatively small. Only the best paying crops are irrigated, and the small size of the individual tracts is offset to a degree by the high returns obtained in years of good prices.
About 50 wells have been drilled and equipped with pumping plants for irrigation in an area lying for the most part north and northwest of the town. (See pi. 1.) Recently less than one-third of the pumping plants have been used for irrigation, owing chiefly to changes in land ownership, poor returns from irrigation, and inadequate funds. The largest tract irrigated in 1930 was 30 acres and the smallest 3 acres. The crops grown were tomatoes and tomato plants, beans, peas, onions, spinach, and citrus fruit. During every irrigation season many of the wells are pumped almost constantly, and between irrigation periods almost continuous pumping is also necessary to store sufficient water. The water in these wells drops to a level just above the top of the water sand soon after pumping is begiin, but no other effect is noticed. After the irrigation season the water surface returns to the level it had before the irrigation season.
Eastern Atascosa County area. North and northeast of Coughran, in eastern Atascosa County, some irrigation is carried on with waters from wells that are supplied by the Mount Selman sands. The irrigation wells range from 850 to 1,100 feet in depth, and all of them flow. The yield of the wells by natural flow ranges from a few gallons a minute near the northerly limit of the flowing-well area to several hundred gallons a minute farther south.
Irrigation thus far has been devoted largely to nursery stock and field crops. In 1930 only two tracts were irrigated, but in earlier years efforts have been made to irrigate other tracts. The water is in general highly mineralized, but the soils are exceedingly sandy, and apparently no ill effects have been experienced.
Other areas. Flowing wells have been developed in the Mount Selman formation in several other areas. At present the water is being used for domestic purposes or for livestock, but in places it could be used for irrigation. At Pleasanton and in an area of considerable size around it many flowing wells have been drilled. These range in depth from 300 to 850 feet and are mostly of small diameter. The yields range from only a few gallons to as much as 75 gallons a minute. A part

MUNICIPAL WATER SUPPLIES

51

of the public supply of Pleasanton is obtained from a well (no. 262) of this character 815 feet deep, and many homes in the town are supplied from similar privately owned wells. The water is satisfactory for domestic use, and some of it could be used for irrigation. Much of the water from the formation contains appreciable amounts of hydrogen sulphide. Many of the wells yield inflammable gas, which was formerly trapped in containers and used for heating and lighting, but with the advent of natural gas from the south Texas fields this practice has been discontinued.
In San Miguel Valley, in Frio County, several flowing wells have been obtained from the Mount Selman formation. Wells on lowlands near the stream flow from depths of a few hundred feet, but on the higher land deeper sands must be tapped in order to obtain flowing wells. The flow varies, but the maximum is about 35 gallons a minute. The wells having the largest yields, of which the Oppenheimer & Lang No. 2 well (no. 84) is an example, range in depth from 790 to 860 feet. Larger yields could be obtained if wells of larger diameter were drilled. The water is used only for stock but could be used for domestic purposes and irrigation.
IRRIGATION FROM WELLS IN COOK MOUNTAIN FORMATION
Water from sands and sandstones in the Cook Mountain formation has been used to some extent for irrigation in the vicinity of Dilley. Elsewhere in the area it is used only for domestic purposes and stock.
In the vicinity of Dilley about 40 wells have been drilled to the basal sand of the Cook Mountain formation for irrigation, the first one in 1927. The wells are 8 to 10 inches in diameter and from 204 to 510 feet deep. None of the wells flow, and the distance the water must be pumped ranges from about 55 to 120 feet. They are equipped with pumps of large capacity and yield sufficient water for the irrigation of tracts of 35 acres or more. The irrigated crops include citrus fruit, spinach, onions, tomatoes, and other vegetables, and flowers.
In 1930 comparatively little land was irrigated in the area because of changes in land ownership and low prices of farm products. Irrigation practice varied widely in the Dilley area, and no accurate data are available as to the average duty of water.

MUNICIPAL WATER SUPPLIES FROM WELLS IN CARRIZO SAND
The towns of Poteet, North Pleasanton, Jourdanton, Pearsall, and Dilley obtain their public water supplies from wells drilled to the Carrizo sand. The town wells at Poteet and North Pleasanton are flowing wells. All these wells are described in the well table (pp. 6480). Analyses of water from two of them are given in the table of analyses (pp. 60-61), as follows: Poteet, no. 218; Jourdanton, no. 250.
The water from these wells has been found to be satisfactory for municipal use. It contains a slight amount of hydrogen sulphide gas vut this is removed by aeration. Iron is also present but not in ^mounts sufficient to affect the quality of the water seriously. Most of the towns that use the Carrizo water have modern water-supply rystems operated by public-utility companies in connection with the manufacture of ice and the distribution of electric power. The usual

52 GROUND WATER OF ATASCOSA AND FRIO COUNTIES, TEX.
equipment includes a modern pumping plant and standpipe or elevated tank. At Poteet the water supply is obtained from flowing wells and rises by artesian pressure into a standpipe.. North Pleasanton is supplied from a well belonging to the San Antonio, Uvalde & Gulf Railroad, the water being sold to a public-utility company and distributed by it. No standpipe is needed, for the water in the well is under a static pressure of 43 pounds to the square inch.
WATER AVAILABLE FROM WELLS FOR DOMESTIC USE AND STOCK
Throughout most of Atascosa and Frio Counties water suitable for domestic use and livestock can be obtained at comparatively shallow depths. In the following pages the general ground-water conditions in various districts throughout the area are described. The conditions set forth for each district can be taken as typical for an area of considerable but indefinite size.
Extreme northern Atascosa County. In the northernmost part of Atascosa County water for stock and family use is obtained either in the Indio formation or the Carrizo sand. In the Indio formation water supplies that have a wide range in quantity and quality are obtained in wells at depths of 125 to 300 feet It is necessary to test this water to determine if it is satisfactory for drinking. In the outcrop area of the Carrizo sand, wells are obtained at depths ranging from about 125 to 200 feet and have water levels about 105 to 140 feet below the surface. These wells yield adequate supplies of satisfactory water. Wells 166 and 167 illustrate conditions in this area. (See pi. 1 and the well table and table of analyses.) In some localities immediately south of the Carrizo outcrop area wells drilled to the Carrizo obtain water at shallower depths than in fbn outcrop area, because of the rather steep slope of the land surface. This i" illustrated by the record of wells 169 and 170.
Anchorage and Rossville area. In the area near Anchorage and Rossvilb flowing wells are obtained from the Carrizo sand in low places along the Atascos:a, River at depths ranging from 380 to 646 feet. In the higher areas closer to th^ Carrizo outcrop the wells do not flow, but good wells may be obtained at 250 feet or less. Water can be obtained in this area from wells in the Mount Selman formation at depths of less than 100 feet, but the yield of the wells is less and the water of poorer quality. The records of wells 163, 164, and 165 illustrate the conditions in this area.
Campbellton area. The wells in Campbellton and vicinity yield bad water ?.t shallow depths, and it is very difficult to obtain satisfactory supplies for domest'c use except from very deep wells. The town obtains water from a dug well in alluvium near the Atascosa River. In the area generally dependence is placed on stored rain water for domestic purposes.
Charlotte area. The wells in the vicinity of Charlotte range from 100 to I,6f2 feet in depth, but most of them are between 100 and 300 feet deep. None of tl 3 wells flow, and the depth to water ranges from about 100 to 300 feet. Tl e shallower wells obtain water from the lower part of the Cook Mountain formation and the deeper ones from the Mount Selman formation and the Carrizo sand. The water is variable in quality but is generally suitable for domestic use. The records of wells 293 and 294 illustrate the conditions prevailing in the shallower wells.
Christine area. The surface rocks in the Christine area belong to the YegTia formation and are composed largely of gypsiferous clay with some beds of sand.

WATER FROM WELLS FOR DOMESTIC USE AND STOCK

53

Wells range in depth from 155 to 1,314 feet. Flowing wells are obtained at depths greater than 950 feet, and the town is supplied from a flowing well 1,314 feet deep (no. 295). Another well in the town 950 feet deep flows, but the water is of poor quality. The shallow well waters are of variable quality, and it is often necessary to case off sands containing bad water in order to obtain a satisfactory supply.
Crown area. Water-bearing sands are found at several depths in the Crown area. In the W. K. Shipman well (no. 337), 1 mile southeast of Crown, sands were found at 165, 357, 650 (Mount Selman), and 1,207 feet (Carrizo). Some of the upper waters are of poor quality. As a rule, however, water that is fairly satisfactory for domestic use can be obtained from shallow wells.
Dobrowolski area. Wells in the vicinity of Dobrowolski range from 150 to 200 feet in depth. The water is of fair quality and can be used for domestic purposes, stock, and boilers. Conditions are generally similar to those around Charlotte.
Hindes area. Flowing wells are obtained in the area round Hindes on low ground in San Miguel Valley from a sand in the Cook Mountain formation. At Hindes this sand is penetrated at depths of 380 to 440 feet. Wells are also obtained at about 150 feet, but the water is of poorer quality than that from the deeper sand. An analysis of the deeper water is given in the table on page 61 (no. 287). The Carrizo sand is encountered in this area at depths of about 1,900 feet. One well a mile southwest of the town has developed a large flow from that formation.
Jourdanton area. The municipal supply of Jourdanton is obtained from a well 1,635 feet deep (no. 250) <n which the water stands 6}4 feet below the ground surface. Other wells in the area range in depth from 400 to 1,500 feet. The C. S. Young well (no. 251) encountered sands at 300, 745, 810, and 931 feet, all in the Mount Selman formation. In general the shallow ground waters throughout this area are of poorer quality than the deeper waters.
Leming area. In and around Leming the Carrizo sand is the best available aquifer. It can be reached by wells less than 500 feet deep. Shallower wells In the Mount Selman formation yield water of variable quality, which is generally, however, fairly satisfactory for domestic use. The records of wells 170 and 171 illustrate conditions here. An analysis of water from well 171 is given in the table of water analyses.
Pleasanton, North Pleasanton, and Coughran area. In the area including Pleasanton, North Pleasanton, and Coughran there are many shallow wells that are supplied by the Mount Selman formation, and on low ground a considerable number of the wells flow. (See pi. 1.) There are also many deeper flowing wells. The depths of all wells in regard to which information was received range from 296 to 1,925 feet. Wells 260 to 280 are examples of shallow flowing weUs: wells 241, 244, 253, 254, 255, 256, 257, and 258 are deeper wells. The abundance of water-bearing sands is shown in the record of the E. R. Breaker well (no. 241), in which sands were found at 44, 200, 643, 927, and 1,206 feet. The water from the shallow and the deep wells is potable and generally suitable for domestic and irrigation uses. Analyses of water from 6 wells are given in the table of analyses.
Poteel area. The Carrizo sand is reached by wells in the Poteet area at depths ranging from 400 to 1,000 feet and is the principal source of the ground water used in the area for domestic purposes as well as for irrigation. It is customary throughout the area to drill wells to this horizon, and most of the wells flow. Before the development of these deeper wells water of poor quality was obtained from wells ending in the Mount Selman formation at depths of 30 to 50 feet. The wells in the Carrizo sand, despite the greater cost of drilling, are the most desirable, because the water can be used for irrigation as well as for domestic purposes. Wells 175 to 238 are in this area. Analyses of water from 6 of the wells are given in the table of analyses.

54 GROUND WATER OF ATASCOSA AND FRIO COUNTIES, TEX.
Northern Frio County. The beds that crop out in the northern part of County belong to the Carrizo sand and the Mount Selman formation. Over a considerable part of the area the Carrizo either is at the surface or lies at relatively shallow depths, and wells in it yield abundant supplies of good water. The wells are from 100 to 500 feet deep. Wells 1 to 19 illustrate conditions in this area. Water can be obtained in a part of the area from the Mount Selman formation at depths of about 100 to 450 feet, but the water is of poor quality, and the wells yield much less freely than those in the Carrizo sand. In some areas in northeastern Frio County there is difficulty in obtaining potable water from the Mount Selman. Wells in the lower part of the Mount Selman formation (Bigford member) yield water of poor quality.
Derby area. In the Derby area records were obtained of wells ranging in depth from 203 to 455 feet. These wells obtain their water from the Mount Selman formation. Wells 146, 147, 148, 149, 150, 151, 152, 153, 343, and 344 are representative.
Dilley area. The shallow water in the area around Dilley is described in the section on water in the Cook Mountain formation (p. 40). Records were obtained of wells ranging in depth from 119 to 137 feet. West of Dilley, in the west-central part of the county, the water is found under generally similar conditions but is of more variable quality.
Pearsall area. Shallow wells in the Pearsall area are discussed in the section on water in the Carrizo sand and Mount Selman formation (pp. 26, 34). The conditions there described prevail over a fairly wide area. Water is usually obtained in wells at depths ranging from about 100 to 250 feet. The water, though usually potable, varies considerably in mineral content. In an area east of Pearsall the sandy upper beds of the Mount Selman formation are at or near the surface and supply wells ranging from about 65 to 250 feet in depth. These wells yield the best water found in the Mount Selman formation anywhere in the area.
WELL DRILLING AND PUMPING METHODS
Most of the water wells of the area are drilled, only a few of them being dug wells. Methods of well drilling differ considerably according to the type and depth of the well and the district in which it is located. The wells drilled for domestic or ranch supply are generally shallow, averaging about 250 feet deep, and are drilled by hydraulic-rotary or cable-tool percussion-drilling machines (pi. 8). The wells range from 4 to 8 inches in diameter and are cased to variable depths. If sands yielding water of poor quality are penetrated these sands are cased off, and the remainder of the well below is uncased. In some domestic wells, however, casing is set the entire depth, or to the water-bearing sand. The domestic and ranch wells are pumped almost entirely by cylinder pumps with windmill power. Strong, fairly constant winds are common, and therefore an adequate supply of water can be obtained by this method.
Pearsall area. The methods of drilling and pumping wells drilled for irrigation vary considerably in the Pearsall area. The wells range in depth from ICO to 2,500 feet and the pumping lift and yield is very variable. At Pearsall, in the shallow irrigation district, the greater number of wells are 100 feet deep, but a few are as much as 200 feet deep. The water-bearing sands are generally encountered at depths less than 100 or 200 feet, but the drilling contracts are usually made on the basis of drilling a well to either of these two depths.

WELL DRILLING AND PUMPING METHODS

55

The irrigation wells are nearly all 10 inches in diameter, though a few are only 6 or 8 inches. The wells are cased to a depth of about 10 feet, or only deep enough to exclude surface run-off and to keep the weathered rock and soil from falling into the well. Below 10 feet the holes remain open and in good shape, owing to the fact that the shales, clays, and sandstones of the Mount Selman formation do not cave readily. It is customary, in the Pearsall district, to drill two wells for each irrigation installation. These are spaced either 15 or 20 feet apart and are fitted with cylinder pumps that are operated by a walking beam connected to a crank and drive shaft. One engine or motor can then drive both pumps. There are a few single irrigation wells in the district, but most of these are used to irrigate very small tracts. One installation consists of three wells spaced 15 feet apart in a line and pumped simultaneously with one engine.
Practically all the wells in this district have been drilled with the cable-tool percussion-type drilling machine, such as is shown in plate 8, B. Machines of this type are suitable for sinking wells as much as 1,000 feet deep. The pumps are of the cylinder type, the cylinders being 4 to 5% inches in diameter. In the pumping installations in which the walking beam, crank, and pitman are used the length of stroke of the cylinder can be varied, thereby changing the yield. In certain other types of installation the stroke of the cylinder is fixed, and the yield can be varied only by changing the speed of the engine.
Power for pumping the irrigation wells at Pearsall is supplied by electric motors, stationary gasoline engines, oil engines, and converted automobile motors. If the tract of land to be irrigated covers only a few acres, an improvised power plant probably serves reasonably well. However, well operators of larger irrigation tracts use more substantial power installations, the electric motor being preferred. Some electric installations are fitted with automatic controls and hence require very little attention.
On some of the irrigated tracts at Pearsall the water is conducted directly from the wells to the land. This is not practicable except on the smaller tracts, because the yield of the wells is too small to maintain a proper irrigation head in long ditches, especially during dry, hot periods. It is customary, therefore, to build concrete storage reservoirs ranging in capacity from about 100,000 to 200,000 gallons and to store water pumped during the night in these reservoirs for use the following day. During times of most intense irrigation the wells may be pumped almost continuously for several days, but this is not the normal practice.
The cost of drilling wells in the Pearsall district is more or less standardized. At the time this investigation was made the customary cost of drilling was $1.25 a foot for the first 100 feet, including the labor of placing the casing and fitting the pump. Deep wells cost slightly more per foot of depth. As most of the wells are cased only for 10 feet the cost of ca'sing is slight. The cost of pump pipe was 46 to 97 cents a foot, according to the quality of the pipe. The cylinder and strainer could be obtained for about $50, the exact cost depending on the size and quality. The cost of the power-plant installation varies with the type.
Dilley area. Irrigation wells in the Dilley area range from about 250 to 400 feet in depth. The yield is considerably greater than that of the shallow wells at Pearsail, and the depth to water is greater. The wells are drilled with a hydraulicrotary drilling machine, similar to that shown in plate 8, A. In the Dilley are% nearly all the wells have been drilled by one driller. Most of them are 10 inches in diameter, but a few are only 6 or 8 inches. Some wells are cased to the bottom, others have only one length of casing at the surface, and still others are cased to intermediate depths. There seems to be no uniform casing practice, and frequently the cost of the casing governs the type and amount of casing used. Some of the uncased wells have caved, and it would therefore seem desirable to case the wells in this district from top to bottom.

56 GROUND WATER OF ATASCOSA AND FRIO COUNTIES, TEX.
Several types of pumps are used in the Dilley area. The deep-well cylinder pumps with geared pump jacks are perhaps more numerous than any other type. A number of wells are pumped with turbine pumps, which are operated by electric motors connected directly to the upper end of the pump shaft. A few centrifugal pumps are used. Most of the pumps are operated with electric motors, but gasoline engines, gasoline tractors, and oil engines are also used. The cost of drilling, equipping, and operating wells is greater than in the Pearsall area, because the wells are deeper and the lift greater. The drilling cost averages about $1.75 a foot for a well 10 inches in diameter; the casing costs $1.50 a foot. A typical installation, consisting of a turbine pump with a capacity of 250 gallons a minute and a 15-horsepower electric motor, costs between $600 and $1,000, depending on the make and the length of the pump setting.
In the Dilley area considerable irrigation is done directly from the wells, but on some farms earth reservoirs are used. Several concrete reservoirs are also in use. Direct irrigation is adequate for tracts of land as large as 15 acres, as the yield of the wells is sufficient to maintain an adequate irrigation head.
Poteet area. The irrigation wells in the Poteet district illustrate another type of construction and use, as they are of intermediate depth and many of them flow. They range in depth from 550 to 1,050 feet; the shallower ones are in the northern part of the district. Most of the wells are 8 inches in diameter at the top and either 4 or 6 inches in diameter at the bottom. There is no imiform practice in this area in the amount of casing used, and many wells are insufficiently cased, simply because the owner desired to keep the initial cost of the well at a minimum. Some of the wells, however, are cased to the water-bearing sand, or for their entire depth. In such wells, the casing is set on a hard-rock layer above the sand, or it is extended into the sand and the length that penetrates the sand is perforated. In some of the wells perforated casing has been used for a considerable distance above the water-bearing sand; in others the perforated casing extends a considerable distance below the sand. Because of this practice, many of the wells yield water of inferior quality. The wells have generally been drilled with hydraulic-rotary machines of the type shown in plate 8, A. Some of the earlier wells, however, were drilled by the cable-tool percussion method. A few of the wells were drilled with large hydraulic-rotary machines such as are used in oil-well drilling.
Many of the wells at Poteet are flowing wells. A large number of them are not equipped with valves and are allowed to flow continuously. Reservoirs are generally used in conjunction with all the flowing wells that furnish water for irrigation. The reservoirs are made of earth and range in size from a fraction of an acre to 4 acres. Many farms, however, are irrigated directly from the wells.
Nonflowing wells and wells that yield only a small quantity by natural flow are pumped. In such wells the depth to water is not great, and therefore the pumping plants are not as elaborate as at Dilley. Centrifugal pumps, air lifts, and a few turbine pumps are used. The pumps are operated with electric motors, tractors, stationary gasoline engines, and oil engines. On the whole there has been very little electrification of pumping plants, and the installations in general are somewhat crude.
Deep wells. The deep irrigation wells and deep wells used for municipal supply have been drilled usually with oil-well drilling equipment. Some of the wells have been drilled by oil-field contractors; others have been drilled by firms engaged only in water-well drilling. The wells are from 1,300 to 2,500 feet deep and generally obtain water from the Carrizo sand. The deep wells are cased to prevent the contamination of the Carrizo waters by mineralized water from the higher formations.

QUALITY OF THE WATEK

57

The diameter of the wells ranges from 6 to 16 inches. The diameter at the bottom is usually less than that at the top, for in most wells the casing has been reduced in size one or more times. The Pearsall city well (no. 94), which is 1,303 feet deep, has 155 feet of 16-inch casing, 806 feet of 8-inch casing, 65 feet of 6-inch casing, 104 feet of 8-inch screen, and 81 feet of 6-inch screen. The city well at Jourdanton (no. 250) is 1,635 feet deep and has 162 feet of 10-inch casing, 1,118 feet of 8-inch casing, 267 feet of 6-inch casing, and 99 feet of 6-inch screen. These wells are cited as examples of properly drilled wells in which great care was taken to insure a good finish. Some of the older irrigation wells were not so well constructed.
No exact figures are available on the cost of the deeper wells. It has been reported that one well recently drilled near Pearsall to a depth of about 1,350 feet and fitted with a pump cost $8,000. This is probably a minimum cost, for the well was drilled as economically as possible. Figures showing the cost of earlier wells are not applicable to conditions prevailing at the time the investigation was made.
QUALITY OF THE WATER
Water analyses. The table of analyses (p. 60) shows that the waters vary widely in chemical character. This is due largely to inherent differences in the chemfcal character of the rocks of the various formations and perhaps in part to chemical reactions that have occurred in the waters within the rocks. In general the amount of dissolved material in water from a given formation varies directly with the depth of the formation beneath the surface. The greater the depth the longer the water has been in the formation and the greater has been its solvent action on soluble minerals present in the formation. As is to be expected, the waters from clean sandstones contain less dissolved material than those from formations containing alternating clays and impure sands.
Water analyses are of importance in determining the adaptability of water for domestic and industrial supply and for irrigation. In the area covered by this report industrial demands for water are not great, and the analyses are of chief importance as indicating whether the water is suitable for domestic use or irrigation. The analyses do not show the sanitary condition of the waters, and statements based on the analyses are made without reference to possible pollution of the waters.
The chemical character of the waters is determined by the quantities and proportions of the basic radicles calcium, magnesium, and sodium and the acid radicles bicarbonate, sulphate, and chloride. Calcium and magnesium affect the value of water for industrial uses, mainly because of the hardness that they cause. Sodium and potassium compounds may cause trouble in irrigation. If the acid radicle is carbonate or bicarbonate the resulting product is sodium carbonate or sodium bicarbonate ("black alkali")- The sulphate and chloride salts are less harmful and form "white alkali."

58 GROUND WATER OF ATASCOSA AND FRIO COUNTIES, TEX.
Requirements Jor domestic use. The adaptability, in a chemical sense, of a water for domestic use is dependent to some extent on the experience of the people using it. If they have been accustomed to waters of low mineral content they will regard as bad waters in which the mineral content is only slightly higher. On the other hand, if they have lived in regions where the waters in general are somewhat heavily charged with mineral matter they will use without question water that may be rather highly mineralized. Waters of the latter type are most common in southwestern Texas. The taste of the water is important, for waters containing as much as 1,500 parts per million of dissolved materials and having a pleasant taste are still acceptable. Next to taste, softness is the most important quality of a water for domestic use. Some soft and otherwise desirable waters are rendered unpalatable by the presence of magnesium salts or sodium chloride, which give them a disagreeable taste.
Requirements jor irrigation. Water for irrigation must be of such chemical nature as not to damage ijie soil on which it is used. There is no fixed standard by which the quality of water for this purpose can be gaged, and it is almost impossible to construct such a standard. The type of water that can be used with safety varies greatly with the type of soil and subsoil, topography, crops, and climate. In Atascosa and Frio Counties the average annual rainfall is around 24 inches, and much of it is concentrated into violent rainstorms. The soils range from extremely porous sandy soils with very good subsurface drainage to clay soils that are almost impermeable. In the sandy soils, any accumulation of objectionable salts from irrigation waters will be largely dissolved and washed out of the soils by the torrential rains. In the clay soils the salts tend to accumulate. It is obvious that a set of standards which does not take into account the physical character of the soils would be of no value. In general, it can be stated that waters with more than 200 parts per million of sodium carbonate and a total of more than 1,000 parts per million of sodium carbonate, sodium sulphate, sodium chloride, magnesium chloride, and magnesiun sulphate should not be used on soils that do. not have good subsoil drainage. Use of water with 200 to 500 parts per million of sodium carbonate is dangerous and should not be undertaken unless a careful investigation shows the drainage conditions are exceptionally good. If the water contains more than 500 parts per million of sodium carbonate its use is certain to result in serious damage to all except the most sandy soils with ideal drainage conditions. In addition it should be kept in mind that the total of the salts previously mentioned should not exceed 2,000 parts per million and that waters with 1,000 to 2,000 parts per million of these constituents demand careful handling.

QUALITY OP THE WATEK

59

It should be understood that this general outline of standards for use of irrigation waters is not universally applicable. Examples are known, in Atascosa and Frio Counties, of water with dissolved mineral matter in excess of the limits given that has been used for years with no apparent ill effects. The conditions of drainage, however, were ideal, and the soil very sandy. At the same time one tract of land irrigated with water containing less than 250 parts per million of total dissolved constituents and less than 100 parts of sodium carbonate showed distinct, progressive damage. The soil was of a clayey type, the irrigation was excessive, and the drainage was very poor. Users of water for irrigation should keep in mind constantly the fact that the matter of drainage is of the utmost importance.

62 GROUND WATER OP ATASCOSA AND FBIO COUNTIES, TEX.
CONSERVATION OF THE WATER SUPPLY
In the season of 1929-30 the discharge of the irrigation wells and of the flowing wells used for other purposes was measured or estimated, the land irrigated with water from wells was mapped (pi. 1), the kind of crops raised was recorded, the amount of water used for each crop was studied, and the quantity of water wasted from each well was computed. This survey revealed the facts that although some of the wells are shut down when the water is not needed, a considerable number in both counties are allowed to flow continuously, and a surprisingly large quantity of water is completely wasted or used to only a minor extent for watering livestock or maintaining fish ponds. Waste occurs from all three of the sandstones that furnish water for irrigation, but attention was given especially to the Carrizo sand, from which the greatest quantities of water are wasted.
The flow of the wells was ascertained approximately by weir measurements, rough volumetric or float measurements, or estimates. On the basis of all data obtained it was estimated that in 1929-30 water was being discharged by wells in the Car-rizo sand at the rate of about 16,000 acre-feet a year about 9,500 acre-feet by wells in Atascosa County and about 6,500 acre-feet by wells in Frio County.
The results of the survey, as presented in plate 1, show that the total area irrigated in 1929-30 with water obtained from the Carrizo sand was 2,085 acres 1,350 acres in Atascosa County and 735 acres in Frio County.
In 1929-30 there was more rainfall than normal, and therefore the quantity of water used for irrigation was less than usual. On the basis of the studies that were made the average annual duty of water was placed at 2.4 acre-feet to the acre in Atascosa County and 2.8 acrefeet in Frio County, although it is recognized that with the best irrigation practice somewhat smaller amounts would probably be adequate. It was therefore computed that, with the acreage irrigated in 1929-30, the quantity of water from the Carrizo sand that is beneficially used for irrigation in a year of average rainfall amounts to about 5,300 acre-feet 3,200 acre-feet in Atascosa County and 2,100 acre-feet in Frio County. These computations lead to the startling conclusion that in each county about two-thirds of the water withdrawn from the underground reservoir formed by the Carrizo sand is virtually wasted.
In both the Pearsall area and the Poteet area there has been some decline in artesian head and a corresponding decline in discharge from each well. The decline has not been great, but nevertheless it has been sufficient to cause some of the wells to cease flowing. If the waste of artesian water were eliminated there would doubtless be an appreciable restoration of head, such as occurred during the winter of 1929-30, when, because of heavy rainfall, only a small amount of

CONSERVATION OF THE WATER SUPPLY

63

water was used for irrigation and wells resumed flowing that had ceased to flow in 1928. It is estimated that by eliminating the waste it will be possible to put under irrigation about 4,000 acres of additional land in the two counties without making any additional draft upon the underground reservoir.
Frequent measurements are being made of depths to water level in selected wells for both counties. This program of water-level measurements is to be continued, and a partial resurvey of the discharge and use of ground water is to be made. The records of depth to water thus far obtained indicate that in both counties there has been a small net decline in the head of the water in the Carrizo sand since the investigation was begun in 1929, while the head in the Mount Selman formation has remained practically unchanged. A longer record of water levels and correlative rates of discharge must be obtained before a close estimate of safe yield can be made. The data at hand, however, lead to the conclusion that the present beneficial use is not in excess of the safe yield and that further irrigation developments can safely be made to utilize all or most of the total discharge as shown by the survey of 1929-30, provided effective steps are taken to eliminate the waste.
