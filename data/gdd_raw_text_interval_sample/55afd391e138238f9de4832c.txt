GROUND-WATER DATA THROUGH 1980
FOR THE HANNA AND CARBON BASINS,
SOUTH-CENTRAL WYOMING
By Pamela B. Daddov
ABSTRACT
Ground-water resources in the Hanna and Carbon basins were assessed in a study from 1974 through 1980 because of the development of coal mining in the area. Data collected from 105 wells during that study are presented in this report. The data include well-completion records, lithologic logs, and water levels. The data are from stock wells, coaltest holes completed as observation wells by the U.S. Geological Survey, and mining company observation wells monitored by the U.S. Geological Survey. The data are mostly from mined coal-bearing formations: The Tertiary Hanna Formation and the Tertiary and Cretaceous Ferris Formation. Well-completion data and lithologic logs were collected during drilling of the wells or from U.S. Geological Survey files, company records, Wyoming State Engineer well-permit files, and published reports.
INTRODUCTION
Ground-water resources in the Hanna and Carbon basins were assessed in a study from 1974 through 1980 by the U.S. Geological Survey. The study was a part of the U.S. Geological Survey's coal-hydrology program. Coal has been mined in the Hanna and Carbon basins since the late 1800's, but coal production significantly increased during the 1970's because of increased production from surface mining. The purposes of the hydrologic study were to describe the existing characteristics of the hydrologic system, including both surface water and ground water, and to monitor changes as mining continued.
This report presents the data collected from 105 wells during the study, including well-completion records, lithologic logs, and water levels. Water-level data collected from these wells prior to the study (Lowry and others, 1973) also are included. The data are from stock wells, coal-test holes completed as observation wells by the U.S. Geological Survey, and mining company observation wells monitored by the U.S. Geological Survey. Water-quality data collected from wells and streams during the study were published previously by Freudenthal (1979).

PREVIOUS INVESTIGATIONS
A comprehensive coal-hydrology study including the Hanna and Carbon basins (Kuhn and others, 1983) provides coal information and surface- and ground-water quantity and quality information. Water-quality data are available in Freudenthal (1979). The water resources of the area are described by Lowry and others (1973). The geology is described in reports by the U.S. Geological Survey (Dobbin and others, 1929; Gill and others, 1970) and by the Geological Survey of Wyoming (Glass, 1972, 1978). A coal resource and reclamation potential evaluation by the Bureau of Land Management, Bureau of Reclamation, and U.S. Geological Survey (U.S. Bureau of Land Management, 1975) also is available. Lithologic and geophysical data are included in Blanchard and Pike (1977), Glass (1978), Hansen and Schug (1979), Hansen and others (1980), Hettinger (1978), Hettinger and Brown (1978), and Schroeder and Dronyk (1978).
The Wyoming Department of Environmental Quality has mine permit information for all coal mines operating in the basins. The permits contain coal, geology, surface-water, and ground-water data. Recent water-level data and completion records on wells not monitored during this study may be available from the Department of Environmental Quality or from the Wyoming State Engineer.
WELL-NUMBERING SYSTEMS
The wells in this report are assigned a local number and site number. The local number is based on the Federal township-range system of land subdivision. The first segment denotes the township north of the 40th Parallel Base Line; the second segment denotes the range west of the Sixth Principal Meridian; and the third segment refers to the section. Subdivisions within a section are lettered A, B, C, and D in a counterclockwise direction, beginning in the northeast quarter (A - NEl/4, B - NW1/4, C SW1/4, D - SE1/4). The first letter following the section number denotes the quarter section (160 acres); the second letter denotes the quarterquarter section (40 acres); and the third It:. ;er denotes the quarterquarter-quarter section (10 acres). A sequential number after the letters distinguishes that well from others assigned a number in the same quarterquarter-quarter section. For example, in figure 1, the well with local number 23N 083W 32DBC01 is the first well in the SW1/4 of the NW1/4 of the SE1/4 of sec. 32, T. 23 N., R. 83 W.
The 15-digit site number is based on the universal system of latitude and longitude. The first six digits denote degrees, minutes, and seconds of north latitude; the second six digits denote degrees, minutes, and seconds of west longitude; and the last two digits (assigned sequentially) are based on the number of sites within a one-second grid. Access to information in the U.S. Geological Survey's Ground-Water Site Inventory (GWSI) data base is by use of the site number.

DESCRIPTION OF THE AREA
The Hanna and Carbon basins, in Carbon County, south-central Wyoming, have a combined area of 1,500 square miles. Resistant rocks of the Late Cretaceous Mesaverde Group, which forms the Saddleback Hills, separate the Hanna basin on the vest from the Carbon basin on the east (fig. 2). The basins are bounded on the north by the Seminoe, Shirley, and Freezeout Mountains; on the vest by the Haystack Mountains; and on the south by the Medicine Bov Mountains*
The average altitude is about 7,000 feet; the topography principally consists of undulating plains broken by high ridges. Typically, the topography closely reflects the structure of the underlying rocks.
Stratigraphic and structural features of the area are shown in figure 3. Outcropping formations range in age from Late Cretaceous to Holocene. The Late Cretaceous Medicine Bov Formation, late Cretaceous and early Tertiary Ferris Formation, and early Tertiary Hanna Formation contain coal layers. Coal in the Hanna and Ferris Formations is mined by surface and underground methods; coal in the Medicine Bov Formation is not mined presently (1980).
DESCRIPTION OF THE DATA
Ground-vater data from 105 veils in the area (fig. A) are presented in tables 1,2, and 3, at the end of this report. This information includes veil-completion records, lithologic logs, and vater levels. Well-completion records and lithologic logs vere collected on-site during drilling of the veils or from U.S. Geological Survey files, company records, Wyoming State Engineer veil-permit files, and published reports. Well-completion data, vater levels, and additional information are available in the U.S. Geological Survey's computer data base, the Ground-Water Site-Inventory (GWSI) file of the National Water Data Storage and Retrieval System (WATS TORE). The lithologic logs are not in the computer data base.
The lithologic logs quoted from published sources have not been edited to conform to U.S. Geological Survey style. Coal bed names are those used by the source and are not necessarily approved by the U.S. Geological Survey.
