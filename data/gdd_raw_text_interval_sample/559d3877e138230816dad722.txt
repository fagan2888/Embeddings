GROUND-WATER USE IN THE COASTAL PLAIN OF MARYLAND, 1900 -1980

by Judith C. Wheeler and Franceska D. Wilde

ABSTRACT

Historically, ground water has been the major source of supply for most users in the Coastal Plain of Maryland. This report presents ground-water withdrawal data from 1900 through 1980 for 16 counties and Baltimore City, that lie either partially or totally within the Coastal Plain physiographic province. These data were collected as part of the U.S. Geological Survey's Regional Aquifer Systems Analysis (RASA) study.
The data are discussed briefly and presented in graphs, tables, and maps. Five water-use categories that comprise the major demands on ground- water supplies are identified: domestic, military, public and private water suppliers, industrial (including commercial), and irrigation. Withdrawal data were obtained or estimated from diverse sources, including Maryland Water Resources Administration files, State and county reports and communication with public officials and individual owners. Aquifer designations of the source ofthe pumpage were determined by consulting published and unpublished geologic reports and were correlated with the 10-layer aquifer system established for the RASA study computer model.

The results ofthis research show that ground-water withdrawals increased from approximately 25 million gallons per day (Mgal/d) in 1900 to nearly 136 Mgal/d in 1980. Anne Arundel and Baltimore Counties and Baltimore City had the greatest withdrawals, more than 5 Mgal/d, for most of the 80-year period.
Domestic and industrial/commercial uses comprised the largest withdrawals from 1900 through 1965. For most of the next 15 years, to 1980, water suppliers constituted the greatest demand on ground-water supplies. Large withdrawals for irrigation in the Coastal Plain began in the late 1950's and were primarily centered in Caroline, Dorchester, Queen Annes, and Wicomico Counties.
The surficial aquifer was the most heavily used source of ground water for domestic use; however, it also provided adequate quantities to a few large users (those withdrawing 0.01 Mgal/d or more). The deeper Patapsco and Patuxent aquifers supplied the most water to large users during the 80-year period, mainly for industrial/commercial use.

INTRODUCTION

The U.S. Geological Survey has conducted Regional Aquifer Systems Analysis (RASA) studies throughout the nation. One of these RASA studies analyzed the northern Atlantic Coastal Plain aquifer system, which encompasses a six-state area stretching from Long Island to North Carolina. The RASA study included development of a digital model to simulate the properties of the Coastal Plain aquifer system and the effect

of pumpage on that system. The data presented here were collected as part of the RASA study, and were used for the calibration and verification of the model.
This report is designed to provide public officials and interested persons a compendium of historical ground-water-use data for the Coastal Plain of Maryland. It was prepared in cooperation with the

Maryland Geological Survey and the Maryland Water RASA and National Water Use Data programs of the Resources Administration. Financial support was U.S. Geological Survey. privided by the Maryland Geological Survey and the
PURPOSE A sID SCOP E

This report presents ground-water withdirawaldata for the 16 counties and part of Baltimore C:ity that lie within the Coastal Plain physiographic provinece (fig. 1). The data are summarized for each county and Baltimore City, as well as for the Coastal Plain rpe.goionn as a

whole, at id are presented in graphs, tables, and maps, Ground-^vater withdrawal data have been categorized
by water user, aquifer used, and quantity withdrawn.
The com >iled data span the period 1900 through 1980.

DATA COLLECTION AND ESTIMATION OF WATER USE

The categories of water use discussed in this report are:
1. Domestic. Includes self-supplied individual houses and general farm use, such as livestock watering.

tapes for this report. Other sources of water-use data include Maryland Geological Survey Bulletins and Reports of Investigations, Basic Data Reports, county water and sewerage plans, and miscellaneous county
reports.

2. A////tery.~Includes Federal military institutions and installations only.
3. Water suppliers.-lndudes municipality, county and town systems, hospitals, institutions, schools, trailer parks, and private water companies.
4. Industrial/commercial.-Includes manufacturing industries, utilities (including electric power), fish hatcheries, laundries, theaters, hotels, motels, government-operated research centers, restaurants, and mining (coal, quarry, sand, and gravel) operations.
5. Irrigation. Includes water used for farmland, nursery crops, and golf courses.
Although this report presents withdrawal data beginning with 1900, few records of actual pumpage were available for individual users prior to the 1960's. Withdrawals between 1900 and 1969 were averaged for each decade in million gallons per day (Mgal/d). Many of these earlier data were estimated based on current withdrawals, population trends, written and oral communication with water users, and amounts given in various reports for a particular time span or year. Most of the graphs for individual counties begin with 1950; however, if enough substantial earlier records were available, graphs were plotted to include these data.
Much of the withdrawal information for large users (those who individually withdraw 0.01 Mgal/d or more) was obtained from the Maryland Water Resources Administration. This agency requires users of 0.01 Mgal/d or more to report monthly pumpage. These data were then tabulated and stored on computer tapes beginning with the earliest known pumpage. Programs were designed to generate graphs and tables from these

Domestic water use was estimated by taking the total county population (Maryland Dept. of State Planning, 198]L) for each year selected and subtracting the estimated population served by municipalities and private vrater companies (Maryland Dept. of State Planning, 1981, and Maryland Dept. ofNatural Resources, 1983). The difference was then multiplied by 75 gallons per person per day (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 1973). The determination of water quantities used for irrigation was based on the estimated number of acres irrigated by ground water (U.S. Dept. of Commerce, 1961,1967,1972,1977, and 1981a; and Carr, 19^5, 1977, and 1980) and an assumed average application rate of 0.6 ft of water per year (Herring, 1983). Irrigation data for counties withdrawing an average of less than 0.1 Mgal/d for this use over the 80-year period were not included in this report.
Pumpage sites were located on county maps using the Maryland Grid Coordinate System method. In this system, a point is designated by actual distances in feet from two! imaginary lines-one running east and west, and the other north and south through a point of origin. The origin of the Maryland Grid Coordinate System is fixed at a point southwest of the State, so that all coordinates are to the east and north of it. The coordinates of this pcint are N O (zero) E O (zero). For mapping purposes,, horizontal and vertical grid lines were established from this point at intervals of 50,000 ft east and north of the origin (Maryland Department of State Planning, 1978).
Aquifer designations were assigned by consulting published and unpublished geologic logs and maps, State and county reports, and correlating depth of screened intervals of wells with the isopach maps constructed by RASA hydrogeologists.

FORMAT

The water-use data presented here are described in individual sections for each county and Baltimore City, preceded by a section for the entire Coastal Plain. The data are depicted in graphs, tables, and maps.

Ground-water appropriation permit numbers given in the tables are issued by the Maryland Water Resources Administration and are presented here for the convenience of any further detailed research.

LOCATION AND EXTENT OF STUDY AREA

This report presents data on ground-water use for the part of Maryland that lies within the Coastal Plain physiographic province (fig. 1A). The Coastal Plain province of Maryland covers an area of 8,240 square miles, or approximately one-half of the total area of the State (Knopf, 1929).
The study area is bounded on the east by Delaware and the Atlantic Ocean; on the south by the Potomac River, the Chesapeake Bay, and Virginia; on the west by the Potomac River; and to the west and north by the Fall Line (the contact between the Coastal Plain and Piedmont physiographic provinces). It is widely dissected by the Chesapeake Bay.

Eighteen Maryland counties lie entirely or partially within the Coastal Plain province: Anne Arundel, Baltimore, Calvert, Caroline, Cecil, Charles, Dorchester, Harford, Howard, Kent, Montgomery, Prince Georges, Queen Annes, St. Marys, Somerset, Talbot, Wicomico, and Worcester Counties. The six counties that lie partially within the Coastal Plain include most of Prince Georges County, nearly half of Cecil County, approximately one-fifth of Baltimore and Harford Counties, and less than one-eighth of Howard and Montgomery Counties. About half of Baltimore City lies in the Coastal Plain. Ground-water use in the Coastal Plain of Howard and Montgomery Counties was not significant enough for the period of study to include in this report.

HYDROGEOLOGIC SETTING

This discussion presents a brief background of the hydrogeology relevant to the material covered in this report. However, for an in-depth treatment that defines and interprets the hydrogeology of the study area, the reader is referred to a publication prepared as part of the RASA study entitled Hydrogeologic Framework of the Coastal Plain in Maryland, Delaware, and the District of Columbia (D. Vroblesky and W. Fleck, U.S. Geological Survey, written commun., 1987).
Maryland covers an area of diverse geology that is divided into five physiographic provinces (regions of distinctive geomorphology) (fig. 1A). The study area comprises the southeastern physiographic province, known as the Coastal Plain province (fig. IB). In Maryland, the Coastal Plain province is bounded on the west by its contact with the crystalline rocks of the Piedmont province. The zone of this contact is characterized by numerous waterfalls, and thus is commonly known as the Fall Line.
The Coastal Plain is underlain by a wedge-shaped sequence of stratified sediments that dip gently to the southeast and range in thickness from zero at the Fall Line to nearly 8,000 ft at Ocean City, Maryland (fig. 2). This body of mostly unconsolidated gravel, sand, silt, and clay comprises a sequence of stratigraphic units

that includes Quaternary deposits at the top of the geologic section, underlain by deposits of Tertiary and Cretaceous age, respectively. The bottommost strata are Lower Cretaceous deposits that lie unconformably on an older complex of basement rocks, which are of Jurassic (?) to Precambrian age (table 1).
As part of the RASA study, the sequence of deposits were divided into 10 regional hydrogeologic units. Each of these units comprise an aquifer, that is, a geologic formation, group of formations or part of a formation that contains sufficient saturated permeable material to yield significant quantities of water to wells and springs (Lohman and others, 1972). Each aquifer is characterized by distinctive hydrogeologic properties and separated by confining units or strata of very low hydraulic conductivity relative to that of the aquifer. The topmost aquifers differ hydrologically from deeper aquifers in that they are not overlain by a confining unit. As a consequence of being unconfined, fluid pressure at the water-table surface is exactly equal to that of the atmosphere. Unconfined aquifers are also called surficial aquifers or water-table aquifers. The term "surficial aquifer*1 is used in this report, although commonly used local designations are also noted. In the confined aquifers, water is stored under artesian conditions (hydrostatic pressure is greater than atmospheric pressure). Although the water level in a well fully penetrat-

Figure 2 is a hydrogeologic section depicting th stratigraphic relationship between aquifer units. All aquifer units are not regionally extensive; those uni important as aquifers in one part of the study area may not be present in another. For example, the aquifer i sediments of Paleocene age (table 1) is not known to exist north ofSt. Marys and Somerset Counties and doe not appear in the cross section. Consequently, th Aquia aquifer rests directly on the confining unit abov the Severn aquifer in most of the study area. (Th Severn aquifer is also referred to as the Monmouti aquifer by the Maryland Geological Survey.) Wher the aquifer in sediments of Paleocene age does exist, i t apparently rests directly on the Magothy Formatior, indicating that the Severn and Matawan Formations ar missing.

'. "he presence and importance of a given aquifer unit is noted in each county section and in table 1 under the diascription of hydrologic characteristics. However, the term surficial aquifer is used in this report for four local aquifers commonly referred to as Quaternary, Pleis ocene, Columbia, and Talbot aquifers (see footnote l of table 1). Where appropriate, the local term is ident ified parenthetically. Local terminology is used in table > and illustrations. Moreover, in this report, the Chop tank aquifer and Raritan aquifer (obsolete usage) are referred to as the lower Chesapeake aquifer and Patapsco aquifer, respectively. Sediments formerly included in the Raritan Formation are now assigned to the upper part of the underlying Patapsco Formation (C. Davidson, U.S. Geological Survey, written commun., 1987). The correlation of stratigraphic divisions formally recognized by the U.S. Geological Survey to local aquifers as well as to regional hydrogeologic units used in the RASA study model are given in table 1.

GROUND-WATER USE IN THE: COASTAL PLAIN OF MARYLAND

Historically, ground water has been the majo^ source for domestic, military, water supplier, industrial/commercial, and irrigation uses in the Coastal Plain of Maryland. Ground-water withdrawals by use from 1900 through 1980 are shown in figure 3. In 1900, the amount of ground water withdrawn was approximately 25 Mgal/d compared to withdrawals o' nearly 136 Mgal/d in 1980. This represents an increase of 438 percent over the 80-year period.
Since 1900, water use in the Coastal Plain increasec in all categories. Estimated domestic water use was about 14.0 Mgal/d in 1900, but increased to about 35.0 Mgal/d in 1980. Water withdrawn for use in military facilities was approximately 1.0 Mgal/d in 1900L Withdrawals increased from about 2 Mgal/d in 1942 to nearly 6.0 Mgal/d in 1970. By 1980, however, military pumpage declined to about 4 Mgal/d. Water withdraw! by water suppliers increased from about 3.0 Mgal/d in 1900 to approximately 56 Mgal/d in 1980, with the; largest increases occurring between 1950 and 1980 Withdrawals for the industrial/commercial category were approximately 8.0 Mgal/d in 1900 and increasec over the following years to a peak of about 49.0 Mgal/c

in 1942. After 1942, this pumpage began to decline and by the late 1940's, about 31.0 Mgal/d was being withdrawn. In 1950, industrial/commercial pumpage increased again to nearly 39.0 Mgal/d, and, over the next 30 years, showed a gradual decline to about 25.0 Mgal/d in 1980.
Large-scale irrigation is a relatively recent type of water use in the Maryland Coastal Plain. Until the late 1950's, most irrigation was in the central and western counties of the State. However, increased urban development in these counties caused a major shift of vegetable growing and attendant irrigation to the Eastern Shore of Maryland where land was less expensive and growing conditions were more favorable (Brodie and others, 1984). By 1969, 73 percent of the acres irrigated were located on the Eastern Shore, and by 1975 the percentage had increased to 85 percent. Figure 3 shows that, in 1960, approximately2.0 Mgal/d were withdrawn for irrigation in the Coastal Plain. Use continued to increase so that by 1980, withdrawals were nearly 12.0 Mgal/d. Figure 4 compares percentage of ground-water withdrawals by type of use for the beginning year of each decade from 1900 through 1980.

In 1900, much of the ground-water withdrawals in the Coastal Plain came from the surficial aquifer. This aquifer continued to supply not only the water needs of domestic use, but also the large quantities needed by several industries and water suppliers. In areas where the surficial aquifers were not available or suitable for use by large users, deeper aquifers were utilized including, in descending order, the Pocomoke and Manokin

aquifers (equivalent to the upper Chesapeake aquifer), lower Chesapeake, Piney Point, Aquia, Severn, and Magothy aquifers, and the Patapsco and Patuxent aquifers in the Potomac Group undivided.
Large ground-water withdrawals from the principal aquifers of the Coastal Plain of Maryland from 1900 through 1980 are shown in figure 5.

ANNE ARUNDEL COUNTY

Ground-water use in Anne Arundel County from 1940 through 1980 is shown in figure 6. In 1940, the amount of ground water withdrawn was approximately 7.5 Mgal/d compared to withdrawals of nearly 41.0 Mgal/d in 1980. This represents an increase of more than 400 percent in the four decades.
Since 1940, water use in Anne Arundel County has increased in all categories. Figure 6 indicates that in 1940 the largest use of ground water in the county was domestic, with withdrawals of about 3.8 Mgal/d. By 1980, this use increased to approximately 9.1 Mgal/d. Withdrawals for military use were about 1.0 Mgal/d in 1940 and increased to about 2.4 Mgal/d in 1980. Water suppliers withdrew about 2.7 Mgal/d in 1940 and continued to increase withdrawals through 1980 to nearly 25.0 Mgal/d, becoming the largest users ofground water in the county. Industrial/commercial use was less than 0.05 Mgal/d in 1940, but increased to about 4.5 Mgal/d by 1980. See appendix for ground-water withdrawal data for each large user: User's name, appropriation permit number, the source aquifer, location on the Maryland Grid Coordinate System, average daily pumpage, and year pumping began.
The percentages of total amount of ground water withdrawn for domestic, military, water suppliers, and industrial/commercial users for 1940,1950,1960,1970, and 1980 are shown in figure 7. The figure indicates a decline in the percentage for domestic use from about 50 percent in 1940 to 22 percent in 1980, and an increase in the percentage of use by water suppliers from 35.8 percent in 1940 to 61 percent in 1980. This is explained for the most part, by the increase in the percentage of the population served by central watersupply systems, either public or private, rather than by individual wells. The percentage of use for the military dropped from 13 percent in 1940 to 8 percent in 1960, and remained about the same for 1970 and 1980. The percentage for industrial/commercial use remained relatively constant for each of the years shown.

Pumpage from the Aquia aquifer remained relatively constant at about 0.03 Mgal/d from 1940 through 1954, then steadily increased to about 0.3 Mgal/d in 1980. From 1940 to the early 1950's, the Magothy aquifer was the major source ofwater in the county. For most of the 40 years shown, withdrawals from the Magothy were between 2.0 and 4.0 Mgal/d. Withdrawals from the Patapsco were about 1.1 Mgal/d in 1940; by the mid-1960's, withdrawals were close to 10.0 Mgal/d. Pumpage from the Patapsco aquifer continued to increase, and by 1980, approximately 20.0 Mgal/d were withdrawn. Pumpage from the Patuxent aquifer began in 1951 at about 0.03 Mgal/d and increased significantly the following years. By 1980, nearly 6.0 Mgal/d were pumped from the Patuxent aquifer.
Locations of Large Ground-Water Withdrawals
The locations ofwithdrawals by large users in Anne Arundel County for 1940,1950,1960,1970, and 1980 are shown in figure 9. Table 2 presents water-use data for the large users located within particular grid blocks for the year indicated on the map.
In 1940, the areas of heaviest pumpage were located for the most part, in the east-central portion of the county, mainly around the Annapolis area. Comparison of the maps shows a substantial increase in large user withdrawals in northern and southern Anne Arundel County from 1940 to 1980.
The locations of withdrawals from individual aquifers supplying the large users in Anne Arundel County (described in table 2 and fig. 9) are shown in figure 10. In 1940,1950, 1960, and 1970, the Aquia aquifer supplied most of the water in the southern part of the county. By 1980, the Magothy aquifer was supplying some of the water to large users in the southwestern section. The Magothy, however, was more extensively used in the central part of the county during the period of record shown in figure 10.

Major Aquifers
Many domestic withdrawals in Anne Arundel County were from shallow wells ( from about 15 to 50 ft deep) tapping the surficial aquifer. Deeper aquifers, including the Aquia, Magothy, Patapsco, and Patuxent, were more widely used by large users. Large user withdrawals by aquifer from 1940 to 1980 are shown in figure 8.

The Patapsco aquifer was used mostly in the northern part of the county; the number of large users relying on it increased between 1940 and 1980. Withdrawals from the Patuxent aquifer were very limited in 1950. By 1960, however, use of the aquifer extended to a few scattered areas in the northern and north-central part of the county and continued to increase through 1980.

BALTIMORE CITY

Approximately one-half of Baltimore City lies in the Coastal Plain province. The first ground-water supplies in the Coastal Plain area of Baltimore City may have been developed as early as the 1600's (Bennett and Meyer, 1952). Most of the water was derived from shallow wells (from about 15 to 45 ft deep). As the population grew and demands for water increased, the city turned to surface water to meet public supply needs. By 1855, ground water was used very little, if at all, for public supply (Baltimore City Department of Public Works, 1970). By 1900, all large ground- water withdrawals in the Coastal Plain area of the city were by industries (see appendix).

tricts of the city, saltwater intrusion from the Patapsco jRiver contaminated the water and pumping from that aquifer was largely discontinued (Bennett and Meyer, 1952). Nevertheless, the Patapsco aquifer was used From the mid-1930's through the mid-1950's (fig. 12).
The Patuxent aquifer was the most important water-bearing formation used in the Coastal Plain area of Baltimore City. In 1900, approximately 7.4 Mgal/d were withdrawn. By 1942, pumpage from the aquifer leaked at nearly 24.0 Mgal/d. Withdrawals then declined to about 3.2 Mgal/d in 1961 and remained Relatively constant through 1980.

Ground-water use by these industries from 1900 through 1980 is shown in figure 11. In 1900, the amount of ground water withdrawn was approximately 7.4 Mgal/d. Pumpage increased the following years to a peak of nearly 25.1 Mgal/d in 1942. However, in the years that followed, withdrawals declined until about 1960. Pumpage afterward remained relatively uniform, comprising approximately 3.3 Mgal/d in 1980, which is about 4.1 MgaVd less than it was in 1900. See appendix for ground-water withdrawal data for each large user: User's name, appropriation permit number, source aquifer, location on the Maryland Grid Coordinate System, average daily pumpage, and year pumping began.
Major Aquifers
In the Coastal Plain area of Baltimore City, the Patapsco aquifer was used extensively during the early development of the Baltimore industrial area (prior to 1900). However, in many parts of the industrial dis-

Locations of Large Ground-Water Withdrawals
The locations of withdrawals by large users in the oastal Plain portion of Baltimore City for 1930,1940, 1950,1960,1970, and 1980 are shown in figure 13. Table 3 presents water-use data for the large users located within particular grid blocks for the year indicated on he map. Areal distribution of large withdrawals remained about the same for all the years shown. However, fewer points of pumpage were noted in 1970 and 1980 than for the previous years presented.
The locations of withdrawal from individual aquifers supplying the large users in the Coastal Plain area of Baltimore City (described in table 3 and fig. 13) are shown in figure 14. Withdrawals from the Patapsco aquifer we re limited to the southwestern part ofthe city. The Patuxsnt aquifer was the principal aquifer used for the years shown. It served the entire Coastal Plain portion of Baltimore City, although its use declined from 1960 to 1980.

BALTIMORE COUNTY

About one-fifth of Baltimore County lies within the Maryland Coastal Plain. Since the early development of this area, ground water has been a source of water supply for many users (Bennett and Meyer, 1952). Much of the early withdrawals were from shallow wells (from about 15 to 80 ft deep) tapping the surficial aquifer. However, as a result ofyears ofheavy pumping, some portions of this aquifer became contaminated with saline water from adjacent estuaries (Bennett and Meyer, 1952). Over time, increasing public-water supply demands were met by extending Baltimore City waterlines farther into the county (Baltimore County Department of Public Works, 1970); however, many large ground-water users, primarily industries, continued to rely on deeper aquifers, including the Patapsco and Patuxent, to meet their needs.
Ground-water use in the Coastal Plain part of the county from 1930 through 1980 is shown in figure 15. In 1930, the amount of ground water withdrawn was approximately 6.3 Mgal/d. Withdrawals increased to a peak ofnearly 23.0 Mgal/d in 1942, then declined during the next 2 years to approximately 12.4 Mgal/d in 1944. Although pumpage increased again several times (17.2 in 1958 and 14.2 in 1969), the general trend was downward, and by 1980 withdrawals were about 6.2 Mgal/d. See appendix for ground-water withdrawal data for each large user: User's name, appropriation permit number, source aquifer, location on the Maryland Grid Coordinate System, the average daily pumpage, and year pumping began.

Use of the Patapsco aquifer was extensive, although, in some areas, heavy pumping caused saltwater intrusion from the Patapsco River which contaminated the aquifer (Bennett and Meyer, 1952). In 1930, pumpage was about 2.8 Mgal/d and increased to nearly 10.0 Mgal/d in 1942. Withdrawals then declined markedly (to approximately 2.8 Mgal/d in 1943). By 1946, pumpage from the Patapsco increased again to nearly 6.0 Mgal/d. Over the next 10 years, pumpage remained at approximately this amount; then in 1957, it increased to more than 9.0 Mgal/d. Withdrawals then began a general downward trend; by 1980, pumpage was only about 0.02 Mgal/d.
The Patuxent was the most heavily used aquifer supplying water to large industries in the Coastal Plain portion of the county. In 1930, approximately 3.5 Mgal/d were withdrawn. By 1942, withdrawals had increased to more than 12.0 Mgal/d. Although withdrawals declined through the early 1960's, they did reach nearly 10.0 Mgal/d in 1970 before declining again to about 5.4 MgaVd in 1980.
Locations of Large Ground-Water Withdrawals
The locations of withdrawals by large users in the Coastal Plain area of Baltimore County for 1930,1940, 1950,1960,1970, and 1980 are shown in figure 18. Table 4 presents water-use data for the large users located within particular grid blocks for the year indicated on the map.

The percentages of the total amount of ground water withdrawn for domestic and industrial uses for 1930, 1940, 1950, 1960, 1970, and 1980 are shown in figure 16. Nearly all ground water withdrawn was for industrial use.
Major Aquifers

As shown in figure 18, the areas of heaviest pumpage in 1930 were confined to two locations, with the greatest amount being withdrawn at the steel plant at Sparrows Point. There was little change in the distribution pattern for the following years shown, except for an increase in the number of pumpage sites, especially during 1970 and 1980.

The surficial (Quaternary), Patapsco, and Patuxent were the most heavily used aquifers in the Coastal Plain area of Baltimore County from 1930 through 1980 (fig. 17). Use of the surficial aquifer began in 1942 (0.5 Mgal/d) and withdrawals remained relatively the same through 1980.

The locations of withdrawals from individual aquifers supplying the large users in Baltimore County (described in table 4 and fig. 18) are shown in figure 19. The use of the Patapsco aquifer was limited to the Sparrows Point area. The Patuxent aquifer was the predominant source of ground water for all of the years shown. Its use was greatest in the heavily industrial section of the county--the area bordering the eastern side of Baltimore City, particularly at Sparrows Point.

CALVERf COUNTY

Ground-water use in Calvert County from 1940 through 1980 is shown in figure 20. In 1940, the amount of ground water withdrawn was approximately 0.8 Mgal/d compared to withdrawals of about 2.8 Mgal/d in 1980. This represents an increase of 250 percent for the four decades. The figure also indicates that for most of the period, the largest withdrawals of ground water were for domestic use. Military use was greatest during the period 1941 (0.8 Mgal/d) through 1949 (0.6 Mgal/d). By 1980, however, military withdrawals had declined to about 0.1 Mgal/d. Large withdrawals for industrial/commercial use began about 1970 and increased from about 0.1 Mgal/d in 1971 to nearly 0.3 Mgal/d in 1979, before declining to about 0.1 Mgal/d in 1980. See appendix for ground-water withdrawal data for each large user: User's name, appropriation permit number, source aquifer, location on the Maryland Grid Coordinate System, average daily pumpage, and year pumping began.
The percentages of the total amount of ground water withdrawn for domestic, military, water supplier, and industrial/commercial uses for 1950, 1960, 1970, and 1980 are shown in figure 21. Domestic use comprised a significant portion of the total pumpage for all the years shown. Military use accounted for 42 percent of total ground water withdrawn in 1950, but by 1980 the percentage had dropped to only 4.6 percent. Withdrawals for industrial/commercial use began hi the early 1970's and, by 1980, comprised about 5 percent of the total.
Major Aquifers
Many domestic withdrawals in Calvert County were from shallow wells (from about 15 to 45 ft deep) tapping the surficial aquifer. Deeper aquifers, including the Piney Point, Aquia, and Magothy, were more widely used by large users. Large user withdrawals by aquifer from 1940 through 1980 are shown in figure 22.

Pumpaj;e from the Piney Point began in 1947, with users withdra wingless than 0.01 Mgal/d. However, duringthe following years, withdrawals increased and by 1980 were attout 0.17 Mgal/d. Large withdrawals from the Aquia aquifer, the greatest supplier ofground water in the county, began in 1941 and averaged about 0.80 Mgal/d through 1950, declining to just more than 0.2 Mgal/d in 1960. By 1980, however, withdrawals had increased again to about 0.6 Mgal/d. The Magothy aquiferwas not used as a source ofwater supplyby large users until 1971. Withdrawals at that time were about 0.04 Mgal/d and increased to more than 0.10 Mgal/d by 1980.
Locations of Large Ground-Water Withdrawals
Th(5 locations oflarge ground-water withdrawals in Calvert County for 1950, 1960, 1970, and 1980 are shown Li figure 23. Table 5 presents water-use data for the largi; users located within a particular grid block for the year indicated on the map. In 1950, heaviest pumpag;e bylarge users was located in the northeastern and extreme southern parts of the county. The maps for 1960 and 1970 show several new locations of large withdrawals, particularly in the central and southeastern areas. By 1980, the distribution was widely scattered throughout the county.
The locations of withdrawals from the aquifers supplying large users in Calvert County (described in table 5 «md fig. 23) are shown in figure 24. Use of the Piney Point aquifer by large users began in the 1950's and was located mainly in the east-central and southeastern parts of the county. The Aquia was the only aq lifer that supplied large users in 1950. Increased use of the aquifer as a source for large quantities of water is shown on the maps for 1960,1970, and 1980. The Magothy was the deepest aquifer used as of 1980, and withdrawals from it remained solely in the northernmost part of the county.

CAROLINE COUNTY

Ground-water use in Caroline County from 1950 through 1980 is shown in figure 25. In 1950, the amount of ground water withdrawn was approximately 3.3 Mgal/d compared to withdrawals of nearly 7.1 Mgal/d in 1980. This represents an increase of 116 percent for the three decades. During that time, the amount of water withdrawn for domestic and water supplier uses remained relatively constant. However, a decline is indicated in the amount of water withdrawn for industrial/commercial use (from about 1.7 Mgal/d in 1950 to 0.4 Mgal/d in 1980). This decline is due largely to the closing of several canneries in the early 1970's (see appendix). An increase in the amount of ground water used for irrigation (from about 0.06 Mgal/d in 1954 to more than 3.5 Mgal/d in 1980) is also shown. The use of ground water for irrigation by large users in the county began in the mid-1950's. Although there have been no precise measurements of the amounts of water withdrawn by individual irrigators, methods of collecting and reporting these data have improved since that tune; however, the most reliable data are from 1970 to 1980. See appendix for ground-water withdrawal data for each large user: User's name, appropriation permit number, source aquifer, location on the Maryland Grid Coordinate System, average daily pumpage, and year pumping began.
The percentages of the total amount of ground water withdrawn for domestic, water supplier, industrial/commercial, and irrigation uses for 1950,1960, 1970, and 1980 are shown in figure 26. It is interesting to note that in 1950, industrial/commercial use comprised about 50 percent of the total ground water withdrawn; in 1980, however, this category of use dropped to only 6 percent. Withdrawals for water supplier and domestic use remained fairly constant for the 4 years shown. Irrigation use increased from about 6 percent in 1960 to 50 percent in 1980.
Major Aquifers
The surficial (Quaternary and Columbia), lower Chesapeake, and Piney Point aquifers were most heavi-

ly pumped by large users from 1950 through 1980 in Caroline County (fig. 27). Withdrawals from the surficial aquifer were less than 0.1 Mgal/d from 1950 through 1975, increasing to about 0.5 Mgal/d in 1976. In 1980, pumpage from these aquifers reached about 0.6 Mgal/d.
The lower Chesapeake aquifer in the lower Chesapeake Group includes several water-bearing units which were used extensively in the county. These include the Frederica (and equivalent Choptank), Federalsburg, and Cheswold aquifers. As figure 27 shows, this group of aquifers supplied the greatest amount of water to large users. In 1969, withdrawals peaked at approximately 2.0 Mgal/d. However, beginning in 1970, use of the aquifers declined primarily due to the closing of several canneries which pumped water from these sands (see appendix). By 1980, withdrawals had been reduced to about 0.8 Mgal/d. Pumpage from the Piney Point increased gradually from about 0.3 Mgal/d in 1950 to just more than 0.5 Mgal/d in 1980.
Locations of Large Ground-Water Withdrawals
The locations of withdrawals by large users in Caroline County for 1950, 1960, 1970, and 1980 are shown in figure 28. Table 6 presents water-use data for the large users located within particular grid blocks for the year indicated on the map. The figure shows that the locations of large withdrawals did not change or increase significantly for any of the years presented.
The locations of withdrawals from individual aquifers supplying the large users in Caroline County (described in table 6 and fig. 28) are shown in figure 29. Withdrawals from the surficial aquifer remained solely in the southernmost part of the county. The use of the water-bearing units of the lower Chesapeake Group was distributed throughout the county. Use of the Piney Point aquifer was limited to the central and northcentral part of the county in 1950, but extended to the south-central part in 1960,1970, and 1980.

CECIL COUNTY

About one-half of Cecil County lies within the Coastal Plain. Ground- water use in the Coastal Plain area of Cecil County from 1950 through 1980 is shown in figure 30. In 1950, the amount of ground water withdrawn was approximately 0.7 Mgal/d compared to withdrawals of more than 2.0 Mgal/d in 1980. This represents an increase of 186 percent for the three decades.
Since 1950, water use increased in nearly every category. The largest use of ground water was for domestic use, increasing from about 0.6 Mgal/d in 1950 to nearly 1.3 Mgal/d in 1980. Withdrawals for use by water suppliers showed an increase from about 0.1 Mgal/d in 1950 to nearly 0.6 Mgal/d in 1980; water withdrawn for industrial/commercial use increased from less than 0.01 Mgal/d in 1950 to just more than 0.1 Mgal/d in 1980. Water used for irrigation was estimated from available data and averaged about 0.02 Mgal/d from 1970 to 1980. See appendix for groundwater withdrawal data for each user: User's name, appropriation permit number, source aquifer, location on the Maryland Grid Coordinate System, average daily pumpage, and year pumping began.
The percentages of the total amount of ground water withdrawn for domestic, water supplier, industrial/commercial, and irrigation users for 1950, 1960,1970, and 1980 are shown in figure 31.
Major Aquifers
Many domestic withdrawals in the Coastal Plain area of Cecil County were from shallow wells (from about 15 to 45 ft deep) tapping the surficial aquifer. Deeper aquifers, including the Magothy and the aquifers of the Potomac Group, were more widely used by large users. Large user withdrawals by aquifer from 1950 through 1980 are shown in figure 32. The use of the Magothy aquifer began about 1968 and, as of 1980, large-user withdrawals were limited to one water sup-

plier (see appendix).
The water-yielding sand and gravel ofthe Patapsco and Patoxent Formations in the Cretaceous Potomac Group farm the Patapsco and Patuxent aquifers (table 1). Where the aquifers are poorly differentiated in Cecil County, they are designated the Potomac aquifers. Figure 32 shows that the Potomac aquifers were thi; most important source of ground water for large us<jrs in the Coastal Plain part of the county, with withdrawals increasing from about 0.12 Mgal/d in 1950 to nearly 0.7 Mgal/d in 1980.
Locations of Large Ground-Water Withdrawals
Th0 locations of withdrawals by large users in the Coastal Plain area of Cecil County for 1950,1960,1970, and 1980 are shown in figure 33. Table 7 presents water-u^e data for the large users located within particular grid blocks for the year indicated on the map.
In 1950, the areas of greatest pumpage were located near the Fall Line and in the south-central part of the county. The successive maps show the increase of the areal distribution of large pumpage, and that by 1980, withdrawals were fairly evenly scattered throughout the Coastal Plain portion of the county.
The locations of withdrawals from individual aquifers supplying the large users in the Coastal Plain area of Cecil County (described in table 7 and fig. 33) are shown in figure 34. The Magothy aquifer was not used as a source of water for large users until after 1960 (see appendix). Its use remained limited to a water supplier located in the southern part of the county. The Potomac aquifers were the principal sources of ground water for large users as shown on each of the maps. A comparison of the maps for 1950 and 1980 shows that the areal distribution of use of the Potomac aquifers increased significantly.

CHARLES COUNTY

Ground-water use in Charles County from 1950 through 1980 is shown in figure 35. In 1950, the amount of ground water withdrawn was approximately 2.3 Mgal/d compared to withdrawals of nearly 9.4 Mgal/d in 1980. This represents an increase of 292 percent for the three decades.
Since 1950, water use in the county increased in all categories. The greatest amount of water withdrawn was for domestic use, increasing from about 1.0 Mgal/d in 1950 to 3.7 Mgal/d in 1980. Withdrawals by water suppliers increased from about 0.2 Mgal/d in 1950 to over 3.0 Mgal/d in 1980. The greatest magnitude of these withdrawals occurred from the mid-1960's through 1980. Industrial/commercial pumpage showed a similar trend during the same period, increasing from less than 0.01 Mgal/d in 1950 to nearly 1.4 Mgal/d in 1980; water withdrawn for military use increased from about 1.0 Mgal/d in 1950 to nearly 2.2 Mgal/d in 1970, gradually declining to about 1.0 Mgal/d again in 1980. See appendix for ground-water withdrawal data for each large user: User's name, appropriation permit number, source aquifer, location on the Maryland Grid Coordinate System, average daily pumpage, and year pumping began
The percentages of total amount of ground water withdrawn for domestic, military, water supplier, and industrial/commercial uses for 1950, 1960, 1970, and 1980 are shown in figure 36. In 1950, domestic and military usage comprised 90 percent of the total pumpage, with only a small percentage each for water supplier and industrial/commercial uses. By 1960, the trend in water use had started to change. There were decreases in the percentage of water pumped for domestic and military uses and a significant increase in water withdrawn by water suppliers. A small increase in industrial/commercial use also was indicated. This trend continued through 1980. However, the percentage of water withdrawn for domestic use remained relatively the same in 1960,1970, and 1980.
Major Aquifers
Many domestic withdrawals in Charles County were from shallow wells (from about 15 to 80 ft deep) tapping the surficial aquifer. Deeper aquifers including the Aquia, Magothy, Patapsco, and Patuxent were more widely used by large users. Large user withdrawals by

aquifer from 1950 through 1980 are shown in figure 37. The Aquia aquifer was not used by large users until about 1970. Although there was an initial increase in its use, since about 1972 through 1980, withdrawals remained between 0.05 Mgal/d and 0.09 Mgal/d. The use of the Magothy aquifer by large users began in 1962 and grew considerably from approximately 0.01 Mgal/d in 1960 to about 2.2 Mgal/d in 1980. Withdrawals from the Patapsco aquifer were about 0.6 Mgal/d in 1950 and gradually increased to about 1.8 Mgal/d in 1969. From 1970 to 1980, greater amounts of water were withdrawn from the Patapsco aquifer with nearly 2.4 Mgal/d pumped in 1980. The Patuxent aquifer provided about 0.3 Mgal/d in 1950. Withdrawals from this aquifer increased through 1971 to nearly 1.0 Mgal/d, then declined to about half that amount (0.5 Mgal/d) in 1973, and remained relatively constant through 1980.
Locations of Large Ground-Water Withdrawals
The locations of withdrawals by large users in Charles County for 1950,1960,1970, and 1980 are shown in figure 38. Table 8 presents water-use data for the large users located within particular grid blocks for the year indicated on the map. For the years shown, the areas of greatest withdrawals were located in the northwestern, central, and north-central part (Waldorf area) of the county.
The withdrawals from individual aquifers supplying the large users in Charles County (described in table 8 and fig. 38) are shown in figure 39. Withdrawals from the Aquia aquifer for 1980 were limited to a single location in the central part of the county. Withdrawals from the Magothy aquifer began in 1960 in the northcentral area. Its use by large users grew substantially from that time, although its areal distribution remained the same.
The Patuxent and Patapsco were the principal aquifers supplying large users in 1950. Their distribution of use centered mostly in the northwestern part of the county, with only one site located in the central section. The pattern of use of the aquifers remained essentially the same through 1960 and 1970. However, by 1980, a noticeable increase in the number of withdrawal sites from the Patuxent and Patapsco aquifers was evident, especially in the north-central area of the county.

DORCHESTER COUNTY

Ground-water use in Dorchester County from 1950 through 1980 is shown in figure 40. In 1950, the amount of ground water withdrawn was approximately 4.2 Mgal/d compared to withdrawals of nearly 9.2 Mgal/d in 1980. This represents an increase of 119 percent for the three decades.
The largest use of ground water in the county was by water suppliers who withdrew nearly 3.0 Mgal/d in 1950, increasing to about 3.4 Mgal/d in 1980. Irrigation use increased considerably from about 0.6 Mgal/d in 1960 to about 3.4 Mgal/d in 1980. Irrigation was an important water use in the county since about the early 1960's. Although there were no precise measurements of the amounts of water withdrawn by individual irrigators, methods of collecting and reporting these data have improved since the 1960's. The most reliable data were for 1970 to 1980. See appendix for ground-water withdrawal data for each large user: User's name, appropriation permit number, source aquifer, location on the Maryland Grid Coordinate System, average daily pumpage, and year pumping began.
The percentages of the total amount of ground water withdrawn for domestic, water supplier, industrial/commercial, and irrigation uses for 1950,1960, 1970, and 1980 are shown in figure 41. It is evident that water suppliers comprised a significant portion of the total pumpage for 1950,1960, and 1970. The figure also illustrates that the percentage of water used for irrigation has increased considerably, from 9 percent in 1960 to 37 percent in 1980.
Major Aquifers
The earliest ground-water pumpage in Dorchester County probably came from the surficial (Quaternary) aquifer. Although these shallow sands continued to

supply much of the low-yield water needs, chiefly for domestic use, a few large users were able to withdraw sufficient quantities of water. As the demand for water increased, the use of deeper aquifers, including the lower Chesapeake, Piney Point, Magothy, and Patapsco aquifers, increased. Large-user withdrawals by aquifer from 1950 through 1980 are shown in figure 42. !
Th4 Piney Point aquifer served as the major source of water for the 30- year period. In 1950, approximately 2.7 Mgal/d was withdrawn from the aquifer by large users. Pumpage increased to nearly 4.5 Mgal/d in 1956, but then began a declining trend over the next 20 years. By 1980, withdrawals had dropped to just more than 1.8 Mgal/d. For most of the 30 years, withdrawals from the other aquifers remained less than 0.9 Mgal/d (withdrawals from the Patapsco aquifer reached about 1.0 Mgal/d in 1980).
Locations of Large Ground-Water Withdrawals
The locations of withdrawals by large users in Dorchester County for 1950,1960,1970, and 1980 are shown in figure 43. Table 9 presents water- use data for the large users located within particular grid blocks for the year indicated on the map. In 1950, the areas of heaviest pumpage were located mostly along the northern border of the county. Distribution patterns remained relatively the same for the other years shown, with only a few sites added by 1980.
The locations of withdrawals from individual aquifers supplying the large users in Dorchester County (described in table 9 and fig. 43) are shown in figure 44. The maps indicate little change in development or use of the aquifers in the county, with distribution remaining centered along the northern and eastern borders.

HARFORD COUNTY

The Coastal Plain comprises only about one-fifth of Harford County. Ground-water use in the Coastal Plain area of Harford County from 1950 through 1980 is shown in figure 45. In 1950, the amount ofground water withdrawn was approximately 1.1 Mgal/d compared to withdrawals of nearly 6.2 Mgal/d in 1980. This represents an increase of 464 percent for the three decades.
Since 1950, ground-water use increased in all categories except for military, which declined from approximately 0.3 Mgal/d in 1950 to less than 0.05 Mgal/d in 1980. From the mid-1950's, the largest use ofground water was by water suppliers, whose use increased from about 0.3 Mgal/d in 1950 to 4.3 Mgal/d in 1980. See appendix for ground-water withdrawal data for each large user: User's name, appropriation permit number, source aquifer, location on the Maryland Grid Coordinate System, the average daily pumpage, and year pumping began.
The percentages of the total amount of ground water withdrawn for domestic, military, water supplier, and industrial/commercial uses for 1950, 1960, 1970, and 1980 are shown in figure 46. Military use comprised about 27 percent of the total water withdrawn in 1950, then decreased to only 0.5 percent by 1980. Withdrawals for water suppliers comprised only 26 percent of the total in 1950. However, by 1980, this use comprised 69 percent.

Withdrawals from the surficial (Talbot and Quaternary) and Potomac aquifers from 1950 through 1980 are shown in figure 47. From 1950 through 1959, withdrawals from the surficial aquifer averaged about 0.7 Mgal/d. In 1960, pumpage from these aquifers increased to 1.4 Mgal/d, primarily due to increases in withdrawals by the town of Aberdeen (see appendix). By 1980, pumpage had declined to about 1.2 Mgal/d.
Withdrawals from the Potomac aquifers began in 1954 at less than 0.1 Mgal/d and increased to almost 4.0 Mgal/d in 1976. The drop in pumpage in 1975 and the rise in 1976 are probably due to variations in withdrawals by the Harford County Department of Public Works (see appendix). By 1980, withdrawals were about 3.4 Mgal/d.
Locations of Large Ground-Water Withdrawals
The locations of withdrawals by large users in the Coastal Plain area of Harford County for 1950, 1960, 1970, and 1980 are shown in figure 48. Table 10 presents water-use data for the large users located within particular grid blocks for the year indicated on the map. In 1950, the areas of greatest pumpage were located along the Fall Line. Although the number of sites of large withdrawals increased, there was little change in the distribution pattern shown on the maps for 1960,1970, and 1980.

Major Aquifers
Earliest ground-water withdrawals in the Coastal Plain area of Harford County probably came from the surficial (Quaternary) aquifer, primarily the Talbot Formation of the Columbia Group. These shallow sands continued to supply some low-yield water needs, chiefly for domestic use. A few large users were also able to withdraw sufficient quantities ofwater from the surficial aquifer. As the demand for water by large users increased, the use of deeper aquifers including those of the Potomac Group increased.

The locations of withdrawals from individual aquifers supplying the large users in the Coastal Plain area of Harford County (described in table 10 and fig. 48) are shown in figure 49. The distribution of use of the surficial aquifer remained virtually the same for the years shown. Use of the Potomac aquifers did not begin until 1954 (fig. 47) andwas limited to areas in the county along the Fall Line.

KENT COUNTY

Ground-water use in Kent County from 1950 through 1980 is shown in figure 50. In 1950, the amount of ground water withdrawn was approximately 1.4 Mgal/d compared to withdrawals of nearly 3.5 Mgal/d in 1980. This represents an increase of 150 percent for the three decades.
Since 1950, water use in Kent County has increased in nearly all categories. Figure 50 shows that during the early 1950's, the largest use of ground water was domestic (approximately 0.7 Mgal/d). Withdrawals for this use remained relatively the same until 1980. Pumpage by water suppliers also remained about the same (0.4 Mgal/d) to 1970. However, increases in withdrawals for this use occurred over the next 10 years, and, by 1980, about 0.8 Mgal/d was being pumped.
From the mid-1950's until 1971, the largest withdrawals were for industrial/commercial use. Following the closing of several canneries and processing plants during the early 1970's, however, withdrawals declined from about 1.0 Mgal/d in 1963 to about 0.6 Mgal/d in 1980.
Water withdrawn for irrigation was greatest during the period 1964 (0.3 MgaVd) to 1980 (1.1 MgaVd). Although there have been no precise measurements of the amounts of water withdrawn by individual irrigators, methods of collecting and reporting these data have improved since the early 1950's. However, the most reliable data are from 1970 to 1980. See appendix for ground-water withdrawal data for each large user: User's name, appropriation permit number, source aquifer, location on the Maryland Grid Coordinate System, average daily pumpage, and year pumping began.
The percentages of the total amount of ground water withdrawn for domestic, water supplier, industrial/commercial, and irrigation uses are shown in figure 51. In 1950,50 percent of the total water pumped was for domestic use. However, this percentage dropped the following years to about 28 percent by 1980. The percentage of water used for irrigation, on the other hand, increased from 10 percent in 1960 to about 31 percent in 1980.
Major Aquifers
Many domestic withdrawals in Kent County were from shallow wells (from about 15 to 45 ft deep) tapping the surficial aquifer. Deeper aquifers including the

Aquia, Severn, Magothy, and Patapsco were more widely used by large users. Large user withdrawals by aquifer from 1950 through 1980 are shown in figure 52.
The Aquia aquifer was a major source of water for large users for the 30 years shown. The amount of its use remained relatively the same during the decade 1950 to 1960 (around 0.4 Mgal/d), then increased in 1960 to about 0.7 Mgal/d, and continued to increase through 11980 to about 1.1 MgaVd. Withdrawals from the Severn aquifer were less than 0.01 Mgal/d until 1978; from then to 1980, pumpage averaged about 0.01 MgaVd.
Use of the Magothy aquifer stayed virtually the same from 1950 through 1970 (at approximately 0.3 MgaVd), when its use declined. From 1971 through 1980, withdrawals averaged about 0.15 MgaVd.
Pumpage from the Patapsco aquifer was relatively constant (approximately 0.1 MgaVd) for most of the 30-year period. However, withdrawals did increase to nearly 0.2 MgaVd during the last few years of record.
Locations of Large Ground-Water Withdrawals
The locations ofwithdrawals by large users in Kent County for 1950, 1960, 1970, and 1980 are shown in figure 53. Table 11 presents water-use data for the large users located within particular grid blocks for the year indicated on the map.
In 11950, the locations of large withdrawals were near the northern border ofthe county, along the southwestern border near the Chesapeake Bay, and along the east-central border. This distribution pattern remained relatively the same until 1970. However, the maps for 1970 and 1980 show increases in withdrawal sites in the central part of the county.
The locations of withdrawals from individual aquifers supplying the large users in Kent County (described in table 11 and fig. 53) are shown in figure 54. For the 4 years shown, the Aquia aquifer was used primarily in the central and southern parts of the county. Large withdrawals from the Severn aquifer appear only on the map for 1980, and at a single location in the central part of the county. The Magothy aquifer had the widest distribution of use, whereas the Patapsco aquifer Was used in only one location in the southwestern part of the county.

PRINCE GEORGES COUNTY

In the early development of Prince Georges County, ground water supplied most of the needs of the inhabitants. However, as the population grew, particularly around the Washington, D.C. area, and demand for water increased, the Maryland General Assemblyin 1918 established the Washington Suburban Sanitary Commission (WSSC) to be responsible for supplying water (surface water from the Potomac and Patapsco Rivers) to the suburban areas ofPrince Georges and Montgomery Counties (Mack, 1966). Since that time, WSSC has extended waterlines throughout most of Prince Georges County, which, as of 1980, served about 80 percent of the population. Nevertheless, ground water continued to supply some large users and individual houses and farms. Much ofthe pumpage for domestic use was from shallow wells (from about 15 to 45 ft deep) tapping the surficial aquifer. Deeper aquifers including the Patuxent, Patapsco, and Magothy were more widely used by large ground-water users.
Ground-water use in the Coastal Plain area of Prince Georges County from 1950 through 1980 is shown in figure 55. In 1950, the amount ofground water withdrawn was approximately 6.0 Mgal/d. By 1970, withdrawals had increased to nearly 10.0 Mgal/d. After that year, pumpage started to decline so that by 1980 it had fallen to about 7.2 Mgal/d, or just more than 1.0 Mgal/d greater than it had been in 1950. A major factor in this decline was the expansion of water service by WSSC to many areas that previously had been supplied by individual wells or by wells of public and private water companies.
Pumpage by water suppliers was about 0.7 Mgal/d in 1950. There was little change in withdrawals until around 1960, at which time a central water supply was put into service at Bowie (see appendix). Pumpage then increased considerably over the next decade so that by 1970, approximately 4.1 Mgal/d was withdrawn by public suppliers, most of which was from the Bowie supply. See appendix for ground-water withdrawal data for each large user: User's name, appropriation permit number, source aquifer, location on the Maryland Grid Coordinate System, average daily pumpage, and year pumping began.
The percentages of the total amount of ground water withdrawn for domestic, military, water supplier, and industrial/commercial uses for years 1950 to 1980 are shown in figure 56. As shown, domestic use comprised about 74 percent of the total water withdrawn in 1950. By 1980, however, the fraction was only about 35 percent, whereas the percentage for water suppliers

increased from 12 percent in 1950 to 40 percent in 1980.
Major Aquifers
Many domestic withdrawals in Prince Georges County were from shallow wells ( from about 15 to 45 ft deep) tapping the surficial aquifer. Deeper aquifers including the Magothy, Patapsco, and Patuxent were more widely used by large users not supplied by WSSC. Large user withdrawals by aquifer from 1940 through 1980 are shown in figure 57.
Pumpage from the Magothy aquifer showed little change from 1940 to 1959. After that time, withdrawals increased from about 0.5 Mgal/d in 1959 to nearly 1.5 Mgal/d in 1980, with a peak pumpage of about 1.7 Mgal/d in 1976.
Continuous use of the Patapsco aquifer by large users began about 1958. By the early 1970's, pumpage had increased to almost 2 Mgal/d. Withdrawals remained more than 1 Mgal/d through the 1970's. However, in 1980 there was a significant drop in pumpage to about 0.5 Mgal/d. This was due to a decline in pumpage from the Patapsco aquifer at Bowie (see appendix).
Pumpage from the Patuxent aquifer began about 1946 and gradually increased until 1960. From 1960 to 1970, significant increases are shown, especially after 1965. During that year, the city of Bowie began using the Patuxent aquifer.
Locations of Large Ground-Water Withdrawals
The locations of withdrawals by large users in Prince Georges County for 1950,1960,1970, and 1980 are shown in figure 58. Table 12 presents water-use data for the large users located within particular grid blocks for the year indicated on the map. The maps show that the pattern of distribution of pumpage developed around the perimeter areas of the county which are generally not served by WSSC.
The locations of withdrawals from individual aquifers supplying the large users in Prince Georges County (described in table 12 and fig. 58) are shown in figure 59. The Magothy aquifer was used mostly in the south-central to southeastern part of the county. Locations of withdrawals from the Patapsco aquifer were primarily in the Bowie area and the southwestern part of the county. For the most part, the Patuxent aquifer was used in the northern part of the county.

QUEEN ANNES COUNTY

Ground-water use in Queen Annes County from 1950 through 1980 is shown in figure 60. In 1950, the amount of ground water withdrawn was approximately 1.2 Mgal/d compared to withdrawals of 4.0 MgaVd in 1980. This represents an increase of233 percent for the three decades.
Since 1950, ground-water use in the county has increased in all categories. The largest withdrawals were for domestic use. In 1950, about 1.0 Mgal/d was withdrawn compared to nearly 1.77 Mgal/d in 1980. Withdrawals by water suppliers remained fairly constant for most of the 30-year period (approximately 0.3 Mgal/d), with an increase to about 0.4 Mgal/d in 1980. Industrial/commercial water use increased from about 0.06 Mgal/d in 1950 to about 0.5 Mgal/d in 1980.
Water withdrawn for irrigation was the second greatest use, increasing from less than 0.01 Mgal/d in 1950 to about 1.5 Mgal/d in 1980. Although irrigation was an important water use in the county, there were no precise measurements of the amounts of water withdrawn by individual irrigators. Methods of collecting and reporting these data have improved since the early 1950's. The most reliable data are from 1970 to 1980. See appendix for ground-water withdrawal data for each large user: User's name, appropriation permit number, source aquifer, location on the Maryland Grid Coordinate System, average pumpage, and year pumping began.
The percentages of the total amount of ground water withdrawn for domestic, water supplier, industrial/commercial, and irrigation uses are shown in figure 61. Domestic use comprised a significant portion of the total pumpage for 1950,1960, and 1970. The figure also shows that the percentage of water used for irrigation has increased considerably from 4 percent in 1950 to 37 percent in 1980.
Major Aquifers
Many domestic withdrawals in Queen Annes County were from shallow wells ( from about 15 to 45 ft deep) tapping the surficial aquifer. Deeper aquifers including the Aquia, Severn, and Magothy were more widely used by large users. Large user withdrawals by aquifer from 1950 through 1980 are shown in figure 62.

From 1900 through 1980, the Aquia Formation was a major source for low- yield water needs for Kent Island and! several areas on the mainland of the county. During the 1940's, large users began withdrawing water rom the Aquia aquifer. Since that time, it has been the most important source of water for large users in the county (see appendix). In 1950, about 0.05 Mgal/d were withdrawn from the aquifer compared to nearly 0.3 MgaVdinl980.
The greatest withdrawals were from the Severn aquifer. It has served as a source of water for the town of Centr sville since about 1900 (see appendix).
umpage steadily increased from about 0.2 Mgal/d in 1900 to OJ MgaVd in 1980. As of 1980, the Centreville water sup :>ly was the only large user withdrawing water rom the Severn aquifer.
The Use of the Magothy Formation as a source of water for large users was limited to the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers' Chesapeake Bay Model facility ocated at Matapeake on Kent Island. Pumping from he aquifer began in 1976 and increased from 0.05 to 0.07 MgaVd in 1979. However, withdrawals declined by 1980 to 0.04 MgaVd.
Locations of Large Ground-Water Withdrawals
The locations of withdrawals by large users in Queen Annes County for 1950,1960,1970, and 1980 are shown in figure 63. Table 13 presents water- use data for the large users located within particular grid blocks for the year indicated on the map. In 1950, the areas of greatest pumpage were located at Centreville and in the south-central part of the county. By 1980, several more large users were withdrawing ground water, mostly in the western and southern parts of the county.
The locations of withdrawals from individual aquifers supplying the large users in Queen Annes County (^escribed in table 13 and fig. 63) are shown in figure 64i The Aquia and Severn aquifers were the principal Sources of ground water for large users for the years shpwn. Withdrawals from both aquifers were located primarily in the central and south-central part of the coilmty. The Magothy aquifer was not used as a source ofl water until 1976 (see appendix). It was the deepest alquifer used in 1980, and the only withdrawals were frorti wells located at Matapeake.

ST. MARYS COUNTY

Ground-water use in St. Marys County from 1950 through 1980 is shown in figure 65. In 1950, the amount of ground water withdrawn was approximately 3.5 Mgal/d compared to withdrawals of about 5.6 Mgal/d in 1980. This represents an increase of 60 percent for the three decades.
Since 1950, water use in St. Marys Countyincreased in all categories except military use. The greatest amounts were withdrawn for domestic use, which increased from about 1.7 Mgal/d in 1950 to 2.8 Mgal/d in 1980. Pumpage by military facilities was about 1.5 Mgal/d in 1950. Withdrawals gradually declined over the next 30 years to 0.9 Mgal/d in 1980. Water suppliers used approximately 0.3 Mgal/d of ground water in 1950. By 1980, these withdrawals had increased to 1.8 Mgal/d. Industrial/commercial use increased from about 0.01 Mgal/d in 1950 tojust more than0.1 Mgal/d in 1980. See appendix for ground-water withdrawal data for each large user: User's name, appropriation permit number, source aquifer, location on the Maryland Grid Coordinate System, average daily pumpage, and year pumping began.
The percentages of the total amount of ground water withdrawn for domestic, military, water supplier, and industrial/commercial uses are shown in figure 66. Domestic use comprised a significant portion of the total pumpage for all the years shown. Military use accounted for 42 percent of total pumpage in 1950, but by 1980 this percentage had dropped to 16 percent. Industrial use comprised only a very small percentage for the 4 years shown in figure 66 (no more than 2 percent).

Major Aquifers
Many domestic withdrawals in St. Marys County were from shallow wells (from about 15 to 45 ft deep) tapping the surficial aquifer. Deeper aquifers including the Piney Point and Aquia were more widely used by large users. Large user withdrawals by aquifer from 1950 through 1980 are shown in figure 67.
Withdrawals from the Piney Point aquifer increased from about 0.2 Mgal/d in 1950 to 0.4 Mgal/d in 1980. Extensive use of the Aquia aquifer began in the 1940's when the naval facility was built near Lexington Park. In 1950, approximately 1.7 Mgal/d was withdrawn from the Aquia. Its use increased over the next 30 years, and by 1980 more than 2.3 Mgal/d were being pumped.
Locations of Large Ground-Water Withdrawals
The locations of withdrawals by large users in St. Marys County for 1950,1960,1970, and 1980 are shown in figure 68. Table 14 presents water-use data for the large users located within particular grid blocks for the year indicated on the map. From 1950 through 1970, the area! distribution of pumpage remained relatively the same, with increases in the number of sites in the Lexington Park area only. By 1980, large ground-water withdrawals were located throughout the county.
The locations of withdrawals from individual aquifers supplying the large users in St. Marys County (described in table 14 and fig. 68) are shown in figure 69. Use of the Piney Point aquifer centered mainly around Lexington Park for the 4 years shown. In 1950, the Aquia aquifer was used primarily in the Lexington Park area. This pattern of distribution showed little change on the map for 1960. However, the maps for 1970 and 1980 show a wider area of use of the Aquia in the county.

SOMERSET COUNtY

Ground-water use in Somerset County from 1950 through 1980 is shown in figure 70. In 1950, the amount of ground water withdrawn was approximately 1.9 Mgal/d compared to withdrawals of nearly 2.6 Mgal/d in 1980. This represents an increase of 37 percent for the three decades.
One of the largest uses of ground water in the county was for domestic purposes. In 1950, domestic pumpage was about 1.1 Mgal/d. However, withdrawals gradually declined over the 30-year period to 0.8 Mgal/d in 1980. Water suppliers used about 0.7 Mgal/d in 1950. These withdrawals increased over the next 24 years to a peak of 1.6 Mgal/d in 1974 before declining to 1.2 Mgal/d in 1980. Water withdrawn for industrial/commercial use was estimated to be less than 0.05 Mgal/d in 1950, but had increased to about 0.3 Mgal/d by 1980.

aquifers including the Manokin and Pocomoke (in the upper Chesapeake Group), Magothy, and the Patapsco increased (fig. 72).
Fr<|>ni 1952, when large users began withdrawing water from the surficial aquifer, until 1962, pumpage was relatively constant at 0.04 Mgal/d. From 1962 through 1965, withdrawals increased to about 0.14 Mgal/di before declining again to 0.04 Mgal/d in 1966. Withdrawals remained steady through 1975 when pumpage from the surficial aquifer ceased (see appendix).
Pumpage from the Manokin and Pocomoke aquifers remained relatively unchanged from 1950 through 1965. After 1965, withdrawals increased to about Oi5 Mgal/d in 1970 and remained about the same through 1980.

Large withdrawals ofground water for irrigation in the county began about 1960. Although there have been no precise measurements of amounts of water pumped by individual irrigators, methods of collecting and reporting these data have improved since the early 1960's. The most reliable data are from 1970 to 1980. See appendix for ground-water withdrawal data for each large user: User's name, appropriation permit number, source aquifer, location on the Maryland Grid Coordinate System, average daily pumpage, and year pumping began.
The percentages of the total amount of ground water withdrawn for domestic, water supplier, industrial/commercial, and irrigation uses are shown in figure 71. In 1950, domestic use comprised the greatest percentage ofground-water use (62 percent). By 1960, however, this use had declined to 40 percent and withdrawals by water suppliers accounted for the largest percentage (46 percent). Between 1970 and 1980, the total amount of water used declined by about 0.3 Mgal/d and water-use percentages remained virtually the same, indicating a similar percentage decline in each water-use category.
Major Aquifers
The earliest ground-water pumpage in Somerset County probably came from the surficial (Quaternary) aquifer. Although this aquifer continued to supply much of the low-yield water needs, chiefly for domestic use, a few large users also were able to withdraw sufficient quantities of water from the surficial aquifer. As the demand for water increased, the use of deeper

Pumpage from the Magothy and Patapsco aquifers stayed about the same from 1950 through 1953. Beginning in 1954, withdrawals increased from both aquifers. This trend continued until 1965 when the rate of pumpage leveled off. Pumpage increased again in the 1970's, peaking at nearly 0.5 Mgal/d for the Magothy in 1972 and reaching nearly 1.0 Mgal/d from the Patapsco in 1978.
Locations of Large Ground-Water Withdrawals
The locations of withdrawals by large users in Somerset County for 1950, 1960, 1970, and 1980 are shown in figure 73. Table 15 presents water-use data for the large users located within particular grid blocks for the year indicated on the map. In 1950, pumpage was limited to the north-central and southwestern sections of the county and this areal distribution remained relatively unchanged through 1960. Between 1970 and 1980, withdrawals increased on the eastern and western boundaries of the county.
The locations of withdrawals from individual aquifers supplying the large users in Somerset County (described in table 15 and fig. 73) are shown in figure 74. Withdrawals from the Manokin and Pocomoke aquifers were confined to the north-central part of the county in 1950 and 1960, but increased along the eastern boundary by 1970 and 1980. Pumpage from the Magothy and Patapsco aquifers was primarily limited to a location in the southwestern corner of the county for all 4 years shown, except for a site on the western boundary which used the Patapsco aquifer in 1980.

TALBOT COUNTY

Ground-water use in Talbot County from 1950 through 1980 is shown in figure 75. In 1950, the amount of ground water withdrawn was approximately 2.1 Mgal/d compared to withdrawals of nearly 3.7 Mgal/d in 1980. This represents an increase of 76 percent for the three decades.
Since 1950, water use in Talbot County increased in all categories, with one of the largest withdrawals being for domestic use. In 1950, domestic withdrawals were approximately 0.7 Mgal/d compared to about 1.0 Mgal/d in 1980. Withdrawals by water suppliers were about 0.8 Mgal/d in 1950. By 1980, this pumpage had increased to more than 1.6 Mgal/d. Industrial/commercial withdrawals were about 0.6 Mgal/d in 1950 and remained relatively the same until 1975, when they declined to about 0.4 Mgal/d. By 1980, however, withdrawals had increased again to 0.6 Mgal/d.
The use ofground water for irrigation by large users in the county began about 1960, with pumpage estimated to be about 0.1 Mgal/d. By 1980, withdrawals had increased to about 0.4 Mgal/d. See appendix for ground-water withdrawal data for each large user: User's name, appropriation permit number, source aquifer, location on the Maryland Grid Coordinate System, average daily pumpage, and year pumping began.
The percentages of the total amount of ground water withdrawn for domestic, water supplier, industrial/commercial, and utigation uses are shown in figure 76. In 1950,1960, and 1970, the percentages of total ground water for both domestic andwater supplier uses were similar. In 1980, however, the percentage for water suppliers increased to 43 percent, whereas the percentage for domestic use declined to 29 percent. Irrigation comprised only 3.5 percent of the total water used in 1960, but, by 1980, it had increased to 11 percent.
Major Aquifers

Point, Aquia, and Magothy, increased. Large user withdrawals by aquifer from 1950 through 1980 are shown in figure 77.
Withdrawals from the surficial aquifer remained about 0.2 Mgal/d until 1976, when they increased to about 0.37 Mgal/d. The highest pumpage during the 30-year period occurred in 1977 at approximately 0.43 Mgal/d, then declined to 0.35 Mgal/d in 1980. Withdrawals from the aquifers ofthe lower Chesapeake Group were about 0.18 Mgal/d in 1950. By 1973, pumpage had declined to less than 0.05 Mgal/d, but gradually increased again to 0.15 Mgal/d in 1980.
Use of the Piney Point aquifer by large users began in 1952 at approximately 0.2 Mgal/d, gradually increasing to 0.3 Mgal/d in 1963. Withdrawals remained at this level until 1975, when they declined to about 0.2 Mgal/d and continued to gradually decrease to about 0.18 Mgal/d by 1980. Withdrawals by large users ofthe Aquia aquifer were less than 0.05 Mgal/d in 1950, but increased to nearly 0.45 Mgal/d by 1980.
The Magothy aquifer supplied most of the ground water to large users during the 30-year period. In 1950, about 0.38 Mgal/d was withdrawn. Following a decline to just less than 0.3 Mgal/d in 1951, withdrawals increased over the next 25 years to a peak of about 0.98 Mgal/d in 1976. Pumpage then declined to nearly 0.86 Mgal/d in 1980.
Locations of Large Ground-Water Withdrawals
The locations of withdrawals by large users in Talbot County for 1950,1960,1970, and 1980 are shown in figure 78. Table 16 presents water-use data for the large users located within particular grid blocks for the year indicated on the map. The areal distribution of use remained relatively the same for each of the years shown, although the number of sites of withdrawal increased from 1950 to 1980.

The earliest ground-water pumpage in Talbot County came from the surficial (Quaternary) aquifer. Although these shallow sands principally supplied much ofthe low-yield water needs, chiefly domestic use, there was some early use of the surficial aquifer by large
users. As the demand for water increased, the use of deeper aquifers, particularly the Cheswold and Federalsburg (in the lower Chesepeake Group), Piney

The locations of withdrawals from individual aquifers supplying the large users (described in table 16 and fig. 78) are shown in figure 79. Use of the Aquia aquifer was limited to the west-central part ofthe county, but its use increased from I960 to 1980. From 1950 to 1980, use of the Magothy aquifer was limited to one location in central Talbot County.

WORCESTER COUNTY

Ground-water use in Worcester County from 1950 through 1980 is shown in figure 85. In 1950, the amount of ground water withdrawn was approximately 4.5 Mgal/d compared to withdrawals of nearlyll Mgal/d in 1980. This represents an increase of 144 percent for the three decades.
Since 1950, ground-water use in Worcester County has increased in all categories. Domestic use was about 1.0 Mgal/d in 1950, and, by 1980, had increased to more than 2.0 Mgal/d. Withdrawals by water suppliers increased from approximately 1.4 Mgal/d in 1950 to about 5.0 Mgal/d in 1980. Industrial/ commercial use increased from about 3.8 Mgal/d in 1970 to 5.8 Mgal/d in 1975, and dropped to about 3.0 Mgal/d in 1980. Withdrawals for agricultural irrigation were about 0.16 Mgal/d in 1960, but increased to 0.68 Mgal/d by 1980. See appendix for ground-water withdrawal data for each large user: User's name, appropriation permit number, source aquifer, location on the Maryland Grid Coordinate System, average daily pumpage, and year pumping began.
The percentages of the total amount of ground water withdrawn for domestic, water supplier, industrial/commercial, and irrigation uses are shown in figure 86. The percentage for domestic use remained relatively the same for the 4 years shown. The percentage for water suppliers was about the same in 1950 (32 percent) and 1960 (about 30 percent), increasing a small amount in 1970 (35 percent). By 1980, it had increased to 46.6 percent of the total. Industrial/commercial use comprised a significant portion of the total pumpage (about 50 percent) for the years 1950 and 1960. By 1980, however, the representative percentage for this use had dropped to 27 percent.
Major Aquifers
The earliest ground-water pumpage in Worcester County probably came from the surficial (Quaternary)

aquifer. These shallow sands continued to supply much of the low-yield water needs, chiefly for domestic use, although some large users also were able to withdraw sufficient quantities of water from the surficial aquifer. However, as the demand for water increased, use of the deeper Manokin and Pocomoke (in the upper Chesapeake Group) aquifers increased.
Large user withdrawals by aquifer in the county from 1950 through 1980 are shown in figure 87. In 1950 about 1.0 Mgal/d was withdrawn from the surficial aquifer. Pumpage gradually increased to about 4.3 Mgal/d in 1975 before declining to approximately 3.0 Mgal/d in ,1980. The largest amount of water for the 30-year period was withdrawn from the Manokin and Pocomoke aquifers. In 1950, about 1.2 Mgal/d was withdrawn. By 1976, more than 5.6 Mgal/d was pumped from the Manokin and Pocomoke; withdrawals declined to about 4.9 Mgal/d in 1980.
Locations of Large Ground-Water Withdrawals
The locations ofwithdrawals by large users in Worcester County for 1950,1960,1970, and 1980 are shown in figure 88. Table 18 presents water-use data for the large users located within particular grid blocks for the year indicated on the map. The maps indicate that the area! distribution of pumpage was similar for the years shown; however, the largest withdrawals were located mostly in the northeastern (Ocean City area) and southwestern sections of the county.
The locations of withdrawals from individual aquifers supplying the large users in Worcester County (described in table 18 and fig. 88) are shown in figure 89. From 1950 through 1980, large withdrawals from the surficial aquifer occurred primarily in the northern part of the county, although use of the Manokin and Pocomoke aquifers was more extensive.

SUMMARY

Ground water was the major source of supply for most water users in the Coastal Plain of Maryland from 1900 through 1980. Withdrawals from Baltimore City and the 16 counties included in this report that lie either partially or totally within the Coastal Plain increased from approximately 25 Mgal/d in 1900 to nearly 136 Mgal/d in 1980. The jurisdictions with the greatest withdrawals (more than 5 Mgal/d for most ofthe 80-year period) were Anne Arundel and Baltimore Counties and Baltimore City.
The major uses of ground water were domestic, military, water suppliers, industrial/commercial, and irrigation. Domestic and industrial/commercial uses comprised the largest withdrawals from 1900 through

1965. For most of the next 15 years, water suppliers constituted the greatest use of ground water.
Laigi;e withdrawals for irrigation in the Coastal Plain begzan in the late 1950's and were primarily centered in Caroline, Dorchester, Queen Annes, and Wicomico Counties.
The surficial (Quaternary) aquifer was a primary source 0f water supply for many domestic withdrawals, and also provided adequate quantities to some large users (viithdrawing 0.01 Mgal/d or more). However, the deeper Patapsco and Patuxent aquifers supplied the most w^ter to large users during the 80 year period, mainly for industrial/commercial use.
