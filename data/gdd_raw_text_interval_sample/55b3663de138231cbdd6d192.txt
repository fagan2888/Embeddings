STRATIGRAPHY OF THE UPPER CRETACEOUS FOX HILLS SANDSTONE AND ADJACENT PARTS OF THE LEWIS SHALE AND LANCE FORMATION, EAST FLANK OF THE
ROCK SPRINGS UPLIFT, SOUTHWEST WYOMING
By HENRY W. ROEIILER

ABSTRACT
Stratigraphic investigations of the Upper Cretaceous Fox Hills Sandstone and adjacent parts of the overlying and underlying Lance Formation and Lewis Shale on the east flank of the Rock Springs uplift reveal that these formations were deposited during a regression of the interior Cretaceous seaway of North America. This regression produced three eastward offlapping shorelines that form the Fox Hills Sandstone along outcrops in the study area. Cyclic sedimentation that accompanied the regression is believed to have been periodic and climate related.
The shorelines of the Fox Hills Sandstone were deposited as chains of barrier islands. The barrier islands are as much as 7 miles long and consist of mostly lower, middle, and upper shoreface sandstone lithofacies. Separating the barrier islands are tidal inlets and a sound, which have associated flood-tidal deltas, ebbtidal deltas, and accretionary swash bars. Continental rocks of bay or lagoon origin in the Lance Formation overlie and intertongue with landward parts of the barrier islands. Underlying and seaward of the barrier islands are rocks of nearshore marine origin that make up the Lewis Shale.
Columnar sections, restored cross sections, and paleogeographic maps analyze and illustrate the description of stratigraphy of the Fox Hills Sandstone, Lance Formation, and Lewis Shale. Descriptions of five long measured surface sections and one corehole section support the barrier island analysis and provide basic subsurface data. Coal beds in the Lance Formation are identified and correlated.
INTRODUCTION
This report investigates the origin, composition, mode of deposition, and paleogeography of the Upper Cretaceous Fox Hills Sandstone and adjacent parts of the Lance Formation and Lewis Shale on the east flank of the Rock Springs uplift. Field work began in the area in 1973 and continued intermittently

through 1983. During this time, 193 stratigraphic sections were measured by Jacob staff and Abney level, and the outcrops were mapped in reconnaissance fashion on U.S. Geological Survey topographic maps at the scale of 1:24,000. Five of the stratigraphic sections measured are described herein. In 1982, the basal 377 ft of the Lance Formation and the upper 10 ft of the Fox Hills Sandstone were cored by the U.S. Geological Survey in the BC No. 1 corehole located in NW'ANWi/jNE'A sec. 4, T. 19 N., R. 100 W. Lithologies of the core are described and fossils are identified.
DESCRIPTION AND ACCESSIBILITY OF THE STUDY AREA
The Fox Hills Sandstone, Lance Formation, and Lewis Shale were investigated along an arcuate belt of partly faulted outcrops about 3 mi wide and 45 mi long (fig. 1). These formations are well exposed along the east flank of the Rock Springs uplift, but are unconformably overlain and covered by the Tertiary Fort Union Formation along the west flank of the uplift and in parts of adjacent basins.
Interstate Highway 80 crosses the center of the Rock Springs uplift in an east-west direction (fig. 1). Two paved roads branch north and south of Interstate Highway 80 near the middle of the study area and provide the primary access routes to outcrops. The paved road to the north leaves Highway 80 at Point of Rocks, Wyo., in sec. 27, T. 20 N., R. 101 W.; it trends east for 2.5 mi and then north for 5.0 mi to the Jim Bridger coal mine and power plant located in sec. 3,

T. 20 N., R. 101 W. (pi. 1). The paved road to the south leaves Highway 80 at an underpass located near the southwest corner of sec. 3, T. 19 N., R. 100 W., and continues 6 mi south to the Black Butte coal mine offices located in sec. 33, T. 19 N., R. 100 W. Numerous improved and unimproved roads and trails

branch from these paved roads and provide access to remaining parts of the study area.
The study area is also less easily accessible from the south by Wyoming Highway 430, which trends southeast from Rock Springs, Wyo. (pi. 1). Sixteen miles southeast of Rock Springs, an improved gravel road

INTRODUCTION
branches east from Highway 430 near the southwest corner of sec. 8, T. 17 N., R. 102 W. This road follows Cutthroat Draw and Black Butte Creek for about 9.5 mi to where it crosses the southernmost exposures of the Fox Hills Sandstone in sec. 28, T. 17 N., R. 101 W. (pi. 1).

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING

The study area is an arid, windy desert, where the annual precipitation ranges from 7 to 14 in. and the temperature ranges from about -30 °F in winter to more than 100 °F in summer (Root and others, 1973). The dominant vegetation is sage, which commonly grows in patches, or thickets. Between the patches of sage and along larger drainages, thin desert grasses, greasewood, rabbit brush, moss, lichens, and a variety of other plants can be found growing. The area is devoid of trees.
The primary drainage is Bitter Creek, which flows from east to west across the Rock Springs uplift and through the study area adjacent to the Union Pacific Railroad (pi. 1). Deadman Wash, a major tributary of Bitter Creek, trends southward along outcrops of the Lewis Shale and joins Bitter Creek near Interstate Highway 80. Numerous smaller, named and unnamed drainages form tributaries of Deadman Wash and Bitter Creek.
The study area is uninhabited, except for itinerants involved in coal mining and electrical power generation, oil and gas exploration and production, and sheep ranching. The Jim Bridger mine in Tps. 20-21 N., Rs. 99-100 W. and the Black Butte mine in Tps. 17-19 N., Rs. 99-100 W. are large strip mines that extract coal from the Deadman seam (as much as 30 ft thick) at the base of the Fort Union Formation. Oil and gas drilling has taken place for several decades along the outcrops studied, but only a few small and widely separated discoveries have been reported. Antelope hunting is permitted in the area each fall, and wild horses and other nongame animals are present in large numbers. Archeological sites are fairly common.
The Lewis Shale, Fox Hills Sandstone, and Lance Formation are locally covered by alluvium across drainages and in small areas of sand dunes. Altitudes generally range between 6,500 ft and 7,000 ft (pi. 1). The terrain consists of a long valley formed by outcrops of the Lewis Shale. East of this valley, outcrops of the Fox Hills Sandstone and Lance Formation rise rapidly along steep slopes (figs. 2 and 3). The strata that make up the three formations dip from 3° to 6° east and are generally homoclinal along

the broad arching of the east flank of the Rock Springs uplift.
The outcrops along the northeast flank of the Rock Springs uplift are offset by numerous east-westtrending, high-angle, normal and reverse faults. The displacement along these faults ranges from a few feet to several hundred feet. A normal fault in Tps. 18-19 N., Rs. 100-101 W. has caused 3 mi of horizontal displacement of the base of the Fox Hills Sandstone. There is no stratigraphic evidence that the fault movements occurred during or before deposition of the Cretaceous formations studied, and younger overlying rocks of Eocene age in the Wasatch Formation are not faulted. These relationships indicate that

FOX HILLS SANDSTONE, LEWIS SHALE, LANCE FORMATION, SOUTHWEST WYOMING

the faulting occurred during late stages of the Laramide orogeny during deposition of the Paleocene Fort Union Formation.
PREVIOUS INVESTIGATIONS
The first geographical and geologic explorations of the western United States that included the Rock Springs uplift area are believed to have been undertaken by Bonneville (1837). He was followed a few years later by Fremont (1845), who conducted geographical surveys for the United States Army. Howard Stansbury, guided by Jim Bridger, made the first survey of coal resources of the Rock Springs uplift in 1852 (Rock Springs Rocket-Miner, March 15, 1975). The first significant fossil discovery was a dinosaur skeleton, which was collected by Cope (1872) from the Lance Formation in T. 18 N., R. 100 W. near Black Buttes Station on the Union Pacific Railroad. A number of geologic and paleontological investigations followed these early explorations, but it was not until the work of Schultz (1920) that the stratigraphic relationships and age of the outcropping formations in the Rock Springs uplift area were accurately determined.
Schultz (1920, pi. 1) combined the Fox Hills Sandstone and Lance Formation as the Laramie Formation on a geologic map that included the Rock Springs uplift. Later, Hale (1950) proposed that the term Lance Formation be used in place of the name Laramie Formation used by Schultz (1920). The name Fox Hills Sandstone, applied to the basal sandstone beds of Hale's (1950) Lance Formation, was apparently first introduced into the uplift area by Weimer (1961).
A barrier origin for the Fox Hills Sandstone on the northeast flank of the Rock Springs uplift, and a lateral facies change of the sandstone to lagoonal shale of the Lance Formation to the west and to marine shale of the Lewis Shale to the east, were discussed by Weimer (1961). Weimer's work was reexamined by Harms and others (1965), who questioned the barrier origin of the sandstone but could offer no convincing alternative. Weimer's barrier hypothesis for the sandstone was subsequently supported by Asquith (1970), who believed that the Fox Hills was deposited as a prograding barrier facies. A comprehensive study of the Fox Hills Sandstone and associated formations on the east flank of the Rock Springs uplift by Land (1972) proved conclusively that the sandstone is of barrier origin.
Land's (1972) field investigations of the Fox Hills Sandstone and associated formations included the measurement of 44 sections along the length of the

outcrops on the east flank of the Rock Springs uplift. The data acquired from these measured sections were then used to determine depositional environments. Land (1972, pi. 6) also isopached the barrier sandstone and determined "lithologic trends." While undertaking field work, Land (1972) examined North inlet and Jim inlet, which had been studied earlier by Weimer (1961) and Harms and others (1965). Land discovered Black Butte inlet and part of Salley sound, but he did not identify South inlet and other small inlets shown on plate 2 of this report. The data presented by me in this report indicate that Land consistently misidentified parts of the upper shoreface sandstone lithofacies along the marineward margins of barrier islands, which contributed to a number of correlation errors.
ACKNOWLEDGMENTS
Geophysical logs of the U.S. Geological Survey BC No. 1 corehole were prepared by S.B. Roberts. Proximate-ultimate analyses of coal beds in the corehole were prepared by Geochemical Testing, F.E. Walker, Director. Ostracodes and charophytes from the core were identified by R.M. Forester and E.M. Brouwers. Mollusk and ammonite fossils collected along outcrops by J.R. Gill, Paula LaPoint, and the author were identified by WA. Cobban.
STRATIGRAPHY
REGIONAL STRATIGRAPHIC RELATIONSHIPS
The Fox Hills Sandstone and Lance Formation were deposited along the western shores of the interior Cretaceous seaway of North America (fig. 4). The Lewis Shale was deposited contemporaneously across the floor of the seaway. The interior seaway extended from northern Alaska and Canada southward to the Gulf of Mexico, and was nearly 1,000 mi wide east of the study area. The primary source area for sediments deposited along the western shores of the seaway was the Sevier orogenic belt located in Idaho and Utah, 150-200 mi west of the study area. From mountains in the Sevier orogenic belt, these sediments were carried by streams eastward across an extensive foreland to the interior seaway (fig. 4). During the Late Cretaceous, the western shorelines of the interior seaway repeatedly transgressed westward and regressed eastward in response to tectonism and eustatic changes, until the time that the Fox Hills Sandstone was deposited. At that time, the seaway made a final eastward regression and permanently evacuated the Central Rocky Mountain

region. The final regression of the seaway occurred in progressive stages, which caused the offlapping of shoreline sandstones that form the Fox Hills Sandstone in the study area. The nomenclature, age, and general stratigraphic relationships of the Fox Hills Sandstone and other Upper Cretaceous formations across northeastern Utah and southern Wyoming are shown in an east-west cross section (fig. 5).
FORMATIONS EXPOSED ON THE EAST FLANK OF THE ROCK SPRINGS UPLIFT
Upper Cretaceous formations exposed from the center of the Rock Springs uplift eastward across the east flank of the uplift begin at the base with the upper part of the Baxter Shale, 4,500 ft thick. The upper part of the Baxter Shale forms the eroded center or soft core of the uplift. Overlying the Baxter

Shale are more resistant ridge-forming outcrops of the Mesaverde Group, about 3,500 ft thick, consisting in ascending sequence of the Blair Formation, Rock Springs Formation, Ericson Sandstone, and Almond Formation (figs. 1 and 5). Overlying the Mesaverde Group and cropping out in the study area are the Lewis Shale, Fox Hills Sandstone, and Lance Formation, which have a combined maximum thickness of about 2,500 ft. Unconformably overlying the Upper Cretaceous formations is the Paleocene Fort Union Formation, which, in turn, is conformably overlain by the Eocene Wasatch Formation.
LEWIS SHALE
TYPE OF OUTCROPS
The Lewis Shale weathers to a long, drab-gray shale valley bounded on both sides by tan, east-dipping

STRATIGRAPHY
sandstone escarpments that form parts of overlying and underlying formations. The valley has minor topographic relief and extensive areas of flat terrain. Parts of the valley form low, undulating hills separated by shallow valleys containing networks of dry drainages. Most of the dry drainages are bordered by sage or greasewood; many are narrow, steeply incised, and as much as 20 ft deep. In a few places, small, flattopped mesas rise a few tens of feet above the valley floor. The mesas are capped with coarse gravels, which are remnants of Pleistocene erosion surfaces.

COMPOSITION AND THICKNESS

The Lewis Shale is mostly composed of dark-gray shale and some thin interbedded ledge-forming tan or brown, very fine to fine-grained sandstone and siltstone. A few knobby outcrops of dolomite concretions are present in the upper 250 ft. The Lewis Shale thickens from west to east across the Rock Springs uplift area (fig. 5). In the study area, it ranges in thickness from 600 ft to 700 ft (Roehler, 1983). The Lewis Shale intertongues with the overlying Fox Hills Sandstone, which makes the contact of these units arbitrary (pi. 2).
PALEONTOLOGY AND AGE
Fossils are rare in the Lewis Shale, except for trace fossils in a few ledge-forming sandstone and siltstone beds in the upper part. The trace fossil Helminthoidea is present locally (fig. 6). The saltwater mollusks Inoceramus fibrosus, Pteria sp., Modiolus sp., and Pholadomys? sp. were collected by J.R. Gill (unpub. data) from the upper part of the Lewis Shale at locality D6419 in SWiANW'ASE'A sec. 7, T. 21 N., R. 101 W. (pi. 2). Gill also collected the ammonite Baculites clinolobatus from a dolomite concretion in the upper part of the Lewis Shale at locality D6415 in SE'ANW'ANW'A sec. 23, T. 21 N., R. 101 W. (pi. 1), near the base of measured section 28 (pi. 2). Baculites clinolobatus is an index fossil which indicates that the age of the upper part of the Lewis Shale is lower Maastrichtian.
DEPOSmONAL ENVIRONMENTS AND LITHOFACIES
The Lewis Shale is mostly composed of rocks of nearshore marine origin. It was deposited in the study area across a shallow marine embayment nearly 100 mi long (north-south) and about 75 mi wide (east-west) that extended from the interior seaway westward to what is now the west flank of the

FIGURE 6. Trace fossil Helminthoidea on the upper surface of a ledge-forming sandstone near top of the Lewis Shale in SW/4 sec. 30, T. 18 N., R. 100 W. Coin used for scale is 0.75 in. wide.
Rock Springs uplift (Roehler, 1990, pi. 2). Separating the northern shores of this embayment from the open waters of the interior seaway was a large lobate delta named the Red Desert delta by Asquith (1970). Rocks comprising the west edge of the delta lap onto the east flank of the Rock Springs uplift, where they consist of sandstone and siltstone that is interbedded with typical Lewis Shale. The delta sediments thicken in the subsurface in basins east of the uplift toward the center of the delta, where the beds of sandstone increase in number and thickness and locally produce commercial quantities of natural gas.
FOX HILLS SANDSTONE
TYPE OF OUTCROPS
The lower part of the Fox Hills Sandstone, generally less than 100 ft thick, forms steeply inclined steplike slopes composed of mostly gray shale that is interbedded with thin resistant ledge-forming tan and brown sandstone and siltstone. Rising abruptly 50-150 ft above the lower steplike slopes are thick sandstone beds that weather to tan and brown cliffs and benches. The tan and brown sandstone is generally overlain by light-gray or white sandstone, as much as 45 ft thick, that forms the cap rock along the Fox Hills outcrops. The light-gray or white cap-rock sandstones are overlain by and partly intertongued with less resistant tan sandstone and interbedded

FOX HILLS SANDSTONE, LEWIS SHALE, LANCE FORMATION, SOUTHWEST WYOMING
gray mudstone, carbonaceous shale, and coal that form the base of the Lance Formation. The beds that make up the Fox Hills Sandstone often appear to be laterally persistant and of uniform thickness along outcrops, but the outcrops rarely parallel the facies strike of the barrier shorelines, and as a result, most of the beds are broadly lenticular (pi. 2).

COMPOSITION AND THICKNESS

The Fox Hills Sandstone is composed of mostly tan, brown, gray, or white sandstone, and some interbedded tan or brown siltstone and gray shale. Thin interbeds of gray dolomite, gray or brown carbonaceous shale, and coal are present locally. The Fox Hills Sandstone ranges in overall thickness from about 75 ft to 225 ft, depending on where the lower and upper intertongued contacts are placed (pi. 2). The sandstone beds that make up the unit are composed of mostly quartz grains that coarsen upwards from very fine and silty at the base to medium to coarse at the top.

PALEONTOLOGY AND AGE

The Fox Hills Sandstone contains numerous beds of oyster shells that range in thickness from less than 1 ft to more than 15 ft. The oysters, genus Crassostrea, mostly occur as lenticular coquinas composed of transported shells and shell fragments deposited in tidal channels, flood-tidal deltas, and ebb-tidal deltas (pi. 2). Tidal current influence on the deposition of some of the coquinas is discernible by directionally oriented shell material (fig. 7). Oyster shells are also present in a few places as lenticular coquinas on the upper surface of forebeach sandstones of barrier islands (measured section 10, pi. 2) and as isolated shell fragments and shell layers in middle shoreface sandstones (fig. 8).
Trace fossils are abundant in the Fox Hills Sandstone, particularly in the lower, more marine parts of the formation. Helminthoidea (fig. 6) and Terebellina (fig. 9) are fairly common in lower shoreface sandstone, and Ophiomorpha (fig. 10) and Cylindrichnus (figs. 11, 12) are present in middle shoreface sandstone. Thalassinoides and Arenicolites were identified in accretionary swash bar sandstones.
The age of the Fox Hills Sandstone is lower Maastrichtian based on the occurrence of the ammonite Baculites clinolobatus (D6415, pi. 2) in the upper part of the Lewis Shale and on the occurrence of other ammonite fossils in Upper Cretaceous rocks in the eastern part of the greater Green River basin (Roehler, 1990, fig. 5).

DEPOSITIONAL ENVIRONMENTS AND LITHOFACIES
The beds that make up the Fox Hills Sandstone comprise the eroded remnants of three eastward offlapping barrier island chains. Separating the barrier islands along the length of these chains are beds of sandstone and shale that were deposited in association with tidal inlets and a sound (pi. 2). The stratigraphic relationships of the barrier islands and associated marine and lagoon depositional environments and lithofacies are illustrated by a generalized cross section (fig. 13).
The barrier islands in the Fox Hills Sandstone were deposited along wave-dominated shorelines

having moderately high tides. The barrier islands were generally 3 mi to 7 mi long. Tidal inlets were numerous, flood-tidal deltas were large, and ebb-tidal deltas were moderate to large. These criteria correspond to mesotidal barrier islands as classified by Hayes and Kana (1976). The tidal ranges were probably between 4 ft and 10 ft, which was undoubtedly higher than normal for most of the eastern shorelines of the interior Cretaceous seaway. The higher tides can be explained by the focusing effect of tides as they converged toward the head of the coastal embayment along which the barrier islands were located. (See previous discussion of Lewis Shale.) Sedimentary structures in shoreline sandstones and the location and configuration of accretionary swash bars leave little doubt that dominant longshore currents and sediment transport directions were north to south.
BARRIER SHOREFACK
The rocks of barrier island origin consist of mostly vertical successions of lower, middle, and upper shoreface sandstone and shale that comprise distinct lithofacies. The approximate thickness, stratigraphic position, composition, and sedimentary structures that define these lithofacies are illustrated in a generalized columnar section (fig. 14).
The lower shoreface lithofacies forms the basal sandstone and shale slopes along outcrops of the Fox Hills Sandstone (fig. 15). The sandstone in the lithofacies is mostly tan, very fine grained to fine grained, and commonly silty, and was usually deposited in thin, parallel beds (fig. 16).

The middle shoreface lithofacies weathers to tan cliffs and benches composed of thick, parallel beds of very fine grained to medium-grained sandstone (fig. 17). In places, the beds are massive as a result of bioturbation. In other places, they exhibit large-scale, low-angle hummocky, trough crossbeds that reflect the churning of offshore bottom sediments by large storm waves, at water depths normally below wave base. These hummocky trough crossbeds are sometimes referred to as "storm wash" (fig. 14). In sec. 25, T. 21 N., R. 101 W., the middle shoreface sandstone lithofacies contains exceptionally large calcareous concretions. One of these concretions, excavated at the Jim Bridger coal mine, is shown in figure 18.
The upper shoreface lithofacies forms a distinctive "white cap" along the Fox Hills outcrops (fig. 17). The white cap is generally composed of a surf zone sandstone in the lower part and a forebeach sandstone in the upper part (fig. 14). The surf zone consists of small-scale, trough crossbeds that, in places, are interspersed with planar crossbeds (fig. 19). The direction of dip of the foresets in the planar crossbeds often reveals the direction of prevailing longshore currents. The forebeach part of the upper shoreface lithofacies consists of sandstone deposited mostly in the swash zone the planar, seaward-sloping parts of beaches. The forebeach sandstone was deposited in mostly thin, parallel, tabular beds (fig. 20).
Sandstones deposited subaerially on the barrier islands are rarely preserved along outcrops. As they comprised most of the elevated, soft-sand parts of the barrier islands, they were rapidly eroded after the islands were abandoned, during ensuing marine transgressions and regressions.

remnants of washover fans and dunes were nonetheless identified along the upper surfaces of some of the barrier sandstones. Because they are very thin and have small lateral extent, they are included in the forebeach part of the upper shoreface lithofacies in plate 2.

The tidal inlets are as much as 3,500 ft wide and 70 ft deep. They are irregularly bowl shaped in profile. Four inlets are named herein: North inlet, Jim inlet, Black Butte inlet, and South inlet (pi. 2). The inlets are filled with mostly gray, soft, sandy shale, and some interbedded tan sandstone and dark-brown to dark-gray carbonaceous shale. Flaser bedding is common; trace fossils are fairly abundant. The presence of flaser bedding and trace fossils suggests that low-tidal ranges (probably less than 3 ft) and low current velocities were controlling factors during

abandonment and infilling stages of the inlets, and that this deposition took place at a very slow rate. The sandstone-filled parts of the inlets consist of mostly fine grained to medium-grained sandstone that commonly exhibits large-scale, a bimodal (landward- and seaward-dipping), planar crossbeds. The presence of the planar cross beds suggests that these sandstones were deposited by higher tides (probably 6 ft or more) having strong current velocities, and that deposition took place at a rapid rate prior to the

time that the tidal inlets were abandoned. Smaller unnamed inlets at the top of the Fox Hills Sandstone in measured sections 119 and 157 (pi. 2) are filled with mostly sandstone having the same bedding characteristics as the named inlets.
Flood-tidal deltas were identified in outcrops of the Fox Hills Sandstone at North inlet in barrier shoreline No. 2 and at Jim inlet, Salley sound, and South inlet in barrier shoreline No. 3 (pi. 2). The flood-tidal deltas are as much as 50 ft thick and 5 mi wide. They are composed of mostly interbedded light-gray fine- to coarse-grained sandstone and dark-gray carbonaceous shale that often grade laterally into oyster

flats at the periphery of the deltas. Current ripples and flaser bedding are common throughout the floodtidal deltas. In the vicinity of flood ramps (fig. 21), the sandstone generally occurs in parallel beds up to a few feet thick, which locally exhibit trough crossbedding. These sandstone beds become thinner and interbeds of carbonaceous shale become thicker toward the center and outer (landward) margins of the flood-tidal deltas.
Ebb-tidal deltas are present in barrier shoreline No. 1 below North inlet and in barrier shoreline No. 2 below Jim inlet (pi. 2). The ebb-tidal deltas are lenticular in cross section and as much as 65 ft thick and 4

mi wide. They usually crop out as tan, massive sandstone cliffs. The sandstone is fine to medium grained and occurs in large-scale trough crossbeds, or in bimodal (landward- and seaward-dipping) planar crossbeds. Oyster shells and oyster shell fragments commonly occur as dark-gray-brown lenses in the sandstones.
UNNAMED EBB-TIDAL DELTA IN BARRIER SHORELINE NO. 1
An unnamed ebb-tidal delta crops out in barrier shoreline No. 1 in sees. 8, 9, 14, 15, 16, 17, 22, and 23, T. 21 N., R. 101 W. between measured sections 10 and 29 (pis. 1, 2). The unnamed delta is lenticular in

14 FOX HILLS SANDSTONE, LEWIS SHALE, LANCE FORMATION, SOUTHWEST WYOMING

cross section and has a maximum thickness of about 65 ft. It is composed of mostly tan, fine- to mediumgrained sandstone containing lenses of oyster shell fragments and a few thin interbeds of gray, sandy shale. Ophiomorpha is fairly common. The sandstone beds consist of mostly small scale trough crossbeds, but a few large-scale, seaward-dipping, planar crossbeds are present locally near the base of the delta.
A paleogeographic map of the unnamed ebb-tidal delta area was not prepared, because associated rocks of tidal inlet and flood-tidal delta origins that would provide important details of the delta are missing. It is significant, however, that the unnamed ebb-tidal delta in barrier shoreline No. 1 directly underlies the flood-tidal delta associated with North inlet in barrier shoreline No. 2 (as does the ebb-tidal delta in barrier shoreline No. 2 directly underlie the flood-tidal delta associated with Jim inlet in barrier shoreline No. 3). The superposition of these ebb-tidal and flood-tidal deltas suggests that the barrier islands and inlets that make up barrier shorelines Nos. 1, 2, and 3 remained in essentially the same locations, although laterally offset as a result of offlapping. These relationships, in turn, suggest that the major drainages along the coastal areas west of the barrier islands remained in about the same locations during deposition of the three barrier shorelines.
NORTH INLET
North inlet and its associated flood-tidal delta crop out along the top of the Fox Hills Sandstone between sees. 6 and 25, T. 21 N., R. 101 W., between measured sections 8 and 30 (pis. 1, 2). The rocks composing the inlet and flood-tidal delta intertongue laterally along the outcrops with rocks of bay-fill origin to the north and with rocks of shoreface origin to the south. The inlet consists of a channel about 500 ft wide and 65 ft deep that is filled with soft, gray, partly sandy shale containing a few layers of limy siltstone concretions, and interbedded tan and brown, fine- to medium-grained, trough-crossbedded sandstone containing abundant small trace fossils (worm borings and trails?). The flood-tidal delta associated with North inlet is composed of light-gray, tan, and brown, fine- to medium-grained sandstone in smallscale trough crossbeds and large-scale (landwardand seaward-dipping) planar crossbeds, and some interbedded gray and brown, sandy, partly carbonaceous shale. Lenses of oyster shells and oyster shell fragments, and burrows, including Ophiomorpha, are abundant in many of the sandstone beds. The oyster shell lenses weather dark gray brown, exhibit rapid thickness changes from less than 1 to more than 15

FIGURE 22. Outcrop of ebb-tidal delta sandstone associated with North inlet in the Fox Hills Sandstone in SW'ASW'A sec. 9, T. 21 N., R. 101 W, near measured section 19 (pi. 2). Lens of dark-colored oyster shells is indicated by arrow.
ft, and appear to fill depressions scoured into underlying sandstone beds (fig. 22).
The paleogeography of the North inlet area is shown in figure 23. Only a small segment of the ebbtidal delta associated with North inlet is included in the paleogeographic map, but the northwest trend of outcrops of the Fox Hills Sandstone and the northeast facies strike of the barrier shoreline indicate that the ebb-tidal delta that underlies Jim inlet (pi. 2) is also associated with North inlet. This ebb-tidal delta is not connected to North inlet along the outcrops, but the delta and inlet are expected to join in the subsurface a short distance downdip. The ebbtidal delta in barrier shoreline No. 2 is similar in configuration to the ebb-tidal delta in barrier shoreline No. 1 described previously.
JIM INLET
Jim inlet and its associated flood-tidal delta and accretionary swash bar crop out as part of the white cap at the top of the Fox Hills Sandstone from sec. 25, T 21 N., R. 101 W., southeastward for more than 7 mi to sec. 29, T. 20 N., R. 100 W., between measured sections 31 and 88 (pis. 1, 2). Jim inlet consists of north and south tidal channels, approximately 2,000 ft and 800 ft wide and 150 ft and 225 ft deep, respectively, that are separated by a mid-channel bar (fig. 24). The tidal channels are filled with dark-gray to gray-brown carbonaceous shale, and interbedded and interlaminated tan to light-gray, fine- to mediumgrained sandstone. Flaser bedding is common. Some of the carbonaceous shale and sandstone beds in the

The flood-tidal delta associated with Jim inlet is lenticular in cross section, as much as 50 ft thick, and nearly 7 mi wide along outcrops. It is composed of mostly tan to gray, fine- to medium-grained sandstone in thin parallel beds, and interbedded gray, carbonaceous shale (fig. 25). These beds are usually current rippled, and flaser bedding is common (fig. 26).

Oyster shell fragments are disseminated through the sandstone and carbonaceous shale beds, and shell coquinas are present in shale matrices as oyster flats at the periphery of the delta (pi. 2; fig. 21).

Black Butte inlet forms a readily visible gap in the white cap of the Fox Hills Sandstone in sec. 4, T. 18 N., R. 100 W. The inlet is about 900 ft wide, as much as 40 ft deep, and broadly lenticular in cross section. It consists of a large main channel located on the north side of the inlet, which is adjacent to and partly overlain by a small channel located on the south side of the inlet (pi. 2). The lower part of the main channel is filled with gray, fine- to medium-grained sandstone in landward- and seaward-dipping, planar crossbeds of tidal origin (fig. 28). The upper part of the main channel is filled with interbedded gray shale and sandstone on the north side of the channel, and these beds intertongue with gray, planar crossbedded sandstone on the south side of the channel (pi. 2). The contact of the sandstone beds that make up the main channel and the small channel to the south is sharp and easily recognized in outcrops (fig. 29). The two channels are generally separated by a thin bed of gray, slightly carbonaceous shale.

The Hall coal bed that overlies Black Butte inlet is missing downdip of where the inlet is exposed. This fact was revealed in core drilling by the Black Butte Coal Company (Lee Bonjourno, oral commun., 1984). The missing coal bed suggests that the outcrops of Black Butte inlet are located near the mouth of the tidal river that formed the inlet.

The paleogeography of the Black Butte inlet area is shown in figure 30. The shape and positions of the main and small channels of the inlet suggest that they are parts of a river that flowed seaward between two of the barrier islands along shoreline No. 3 (pi. 2). The main channel was formed by a large tidal river, which was later abandoned, and the south edge of its channel was reoccupied by a smaller

South inlet consists of a small, narrow, shale- and sandstone-filled tidal channel located in sec. 1, T. 17 N., R. 101 W., at measured sections 174 and 175 (pi. 2). It is the southernmost tidal inlet in the Fox Hills Sandstone in outcrops along the east flank of the Rock Springs uplift. Associated with the inlet are extensive sandstone beds of flood-tidal origin, as much as 60 ft thick, that crop out from sec. 30, T. 18 N., R. 100 W. southward for more than 4 mi to sec. 22, T. 17 N., R. 101 W. (pis. 1 and 2). The flood-tidal delta sandstones are composed of mostly light gray, fine- to coarse-grained sandstone in large (landwardand seaward-dipping) planar crossbeds in the lower part, which intertongues in the upper part with lightgray, fine-grained sandstone and gray, carbonaceous shale. The upper sandstone and shale part occurs in mostly undulating, current-rippled, subparallel beds; flaser bedding is common. The size, location, and configuration of the inlet in relation to the flood-tidal delta indicate that either the inlet shifted locations southward during late stages of development, or it was very wide and complex and did not consist of a single channel. Of the two possibilities, the latter seems the more plausible.
A paleogeographic map of the South inlet area is shown in figure 31. From available data, it appears that the inlet was located at the mouth of a major, sediment-choked, distributary river. The primary outlet for this river was the tidal channel located in measured sections 174 and 175. The remaining parts of the inlet probably consisted of broad, sandy, tidal flats made up of linear, seaward-trending, swash bars and shallow intervening channels, which near their seaward edge formed an extensive ebb-tidal delta. Remnants of the barrier island shoreline protruded islandlike through the tidal flats at two locations sec. 30, T. 18 N., R. 100 W., and sees. 2 and 11, T. 17 N., R. 101 W. (fig. 31). South inlet could be classified a sound, but it probably did not have large areas of open water at ebb tide.

SALLEY SOUND
The Fox Hills Sandstone is missing in outcrops across parts of sees. 16 and 21, T. 19 N., R. 100 W., between measured sections 121 and 134, and in sec. 31, T. 19 N., R. 100 W., where measured section 135 is offset by faults (pi. 2). The thick brown, tan, and white middle and upper shoreface sandstones that characterize the Fox Hills outcrops in other places along the east flank of the Rock Springs uplift are replaced by beds of soft gray shale and some thin interbedded tan and gray, very fine to fine-grained sandstone, and tan and gray siltstone (fig. 32). Inspection of these outcrops indicates that these beds were deposited in a sound (Salley sound), which was present between two of the barrier islands in barrier shoreline No. 3 (pi. 2). Salley sound has an overall lenticular configuration in cross section and a lateral extent of slightly more than 2 mi. Shale and sandstone beds, about 50 ft thick, were deposited in the

lower part of the sound as bay-fill sediments. Overlying these rocks are sandstone beds that were deposited as a flood-tidal delta, as tidal channels, and as an accretionary swash bar during the abandonment stages of the sound. The flood-tidal delta is separated from underlying rocks of bay-fill origin by a thin split of the Hall coal bed (pi. 2). Large oyster beds are present in the flood-tidal delta and tidal channel sandstones, and their occurrence attests to the presence of brackish water in Salley sound.
A paleogeographic map of the Salley sound area during an early stage of development is shown in figure 33. At that time, the sound had a large accretionary swash bar along its south edge, where it opened into the interior seaway. A linear, submerged channel bar was present near the middle of the sound. Peripheral oyster flats were present in the shallow water at the landward edges of these bars. The small tidal inlet north of Salley sound in sec. 17, T. 19 N., R. 100 W. (fig. 33) is shown to open into a bay landward of

ACCRETIONARY SWASH BARS AlJlM INLET AND SALLEY SOUND
The relationship of accretionary swash bars to tidal inlets is illustrated in figure 21. The accretionary swash bar at Jim inlet weathers to a persistent cliff and is part of the white cap on the Fox Hills Sandstone (fig. 34). The beds that form the swash bar crop out for about 2 mi and are as much as 31 ft thick. They are composed of mostly light gray to white, fine- to medium-grained sandstone that occurs in thick, parallel beds that accrete in a southeast direction. The sandstone is commonly bioturbated and some of the beds have very thin, dark-gray, carbonaceous shale interbeds and partings. The upper 0.5 ft of the swash bar is composed of rooted, carbonaceous sandstone where it is in contact with the overlying Hall coal bed (pi. 2). The swash bar at Jim inlet unconformably overlies sandstone and shale beds of flood-tidal delta origin and sandstone beds of upper shoreface (surf zone) origin. A scoured contact of the swash bar sandstone with underlying floodtidal sandstone and shale is shown in figure 35.
The accretionary swash bar at Salley sound crops out for about 1 mi and has a maximum thickness of about 35 ft. It is composed of light-gray, fine- to medium-grained sandstone with some carbonaceous shale partings. It occurs in thick, subparallel beds. The swash bar was deposited along the south margins of an open water sound, mostly as sand waves as much as 3 ft in height and 60 ft long. These

The Fox Hills Sandstone and adjacent rocks in the study area were measured and described by Land (1972) and Roehler (this report). Although the same rocks were measured and described in these investigations, we reached different interpretations and conclusions concerning their origin and mode of deposition. Land (1972, p. 62; pi. 2) concluded that the shoreline sequences that comprise the Fox Hills Sandstone offlapped as three distinct sandstone bodies of progressively younger age, which rise stratigraphically in step fashion along the length of the outcrops (fig. 36A). He believed that between the offlapping sequences were periods of significant shoreline submergence and marine transgression. My investigations indicate that only barrier shorelines Nos. 1 and 2 offlapped in step fashion and that little evidence exists for pronounced marine transgression in the intervals between shoreline deposition.
Land (1972, pi. 2) identified three different coal beds overlying the Fox Hills Sandstone (fig. 36A). My correlations (fig. 36B; pi. 2) indicate that Land's three coal beds are actually only two coal beds the Hall bed and an unidentified coal bed immediately overlying barrier shoreline No. 1. The Hall coal bed contains several splits and partings, but persists along outcrops above the Fox Hills Sandstone across the entire study area. In several places, the Hall coal bed rests directly upon barrier shorelines Nos. 2 and 3. These relationships indicate that the Hall coal bed was diachronous, and that no major interruptions of coal (peat) deposition occurred on the landward side of the barriers as a result of pronounced shoreline subsidence or marine transgression.
I believe that deposition of the Fox Hills Sandstone occurred in three time-transgressive stages that were primarily defined and separated by periods of stillstand, during which time the deposition of coarse elastics (mostly sand) diminished and the shoreline areas underwent minor subsidence. If significant marine transgressions had accompanied these subsidences, their stratigraphic position would be defined by unconformities and transgressive shoreline deposits; none were observed along the outcrops. Also, if major marine transgressions had occurred, one would expect that the forebeach sandstone lithofacies of the three barrier shorelines would overlap each other geographically; no such overlapping was observed along the outcrops. Thus the stratigraphic evidence seems to indicate that the barrier shorelines were stable and that eustatic changes, if they occurred, were minor.

BARRIER ISLAND MODELS
A stylized model for barrier shoreline deposition in the Fox Hills Sandstone was prepared by Land

(1972), using what is published herein as figure 37A as his mature stage of barrier development. Land's model differs from the model prepared by me (fig. 13) in that he interpreted the surf zone and forebeach

(1) that the primary sedimentary structures and stratigraphic position of Land's estuary sandstones clearly show they are of mostly surf zone and forebeach zone origins; (2) that estuary sandstones when present in the study area are restricted to inlets and lagoons; and (3) that the surf and forebeach zones are everywhere in conformable contact with underlying shoreface lithofacies (pi. 2, this report).
Using Land's (1972) model (fig. 37A) as a guide, I have prepared a similar stylized model that reinterprets a mature stage of barrier shoreline development in the Fox Hills Sandstone (fig. 37B).

TYPE OF OUTCROPS
As previously discussed, the Lance Formation overlies and intertongues at its base with the Fox Hills Sandstone; it is unconformably overlain by the Fort Union Formation (fig. 1). The lower 200-400 ft of the Lance Formation crops out in steep, gray and tan, steplike slopes overlying more resistant benchforming outcrops of the Fox Hills Sandstone (fig. 2). In places, the lower slopes of the Lance Formation are brick red as a result of burned (clinkered) coal and country rock. Above the lower 400 ft of the formation, the outcrops consist of mostly broken terrane formed by barren, resistant, tan sandstone ridges that rise along long dip slopes between sagecovered, drab-gray shale valleys. The drainages that cross the outcrops of the formation are generally dry and mostly trend toward the valley formed by the Lewis Shale.

zone of the upper shoreface as "estuary sands." He believed that these estuary sands were deposited in deep inlets that migrated parallel to the shoreline and in this manner eroded and destroyed the record of foreshore and upper shoreface sedimentation. As a result of this interpretation, Land (1972, p. 59-62) placed estuary sandstones everywhere along the top of the Fox Hills Sandstone (fig. 37A). Land (1972, pi. 2) also indicated that the estuary sandstones are in unconformable contact with underlying parts of the shoreface lithofacies. My field observations indicate

The Lance Formation is composed of interbedded tan and gray sandstone and siltstone, gray shale, dark-gray and dark-brown carbonaceous shale, and coal. Dolomite and hematite concretions are common. The formation reaches a maximum exposed thickness of about 1,000 ft near the center of the east flank of the Rock Springs uplift a few miles north of Interstate Highway 80 (Roehler, 1983). The formation continues to thicken in the subsurface off the east flank of the uplift into the adjacent Great Divide and Washakie basins.

DEPOSITIONAL ENVIRONMENTS AND LITHOFACIES

Investigations of the Lance Formation are restricted to the lower 400 ft of the formation, which was deposited in bays landward of the barrier islands that formed the Fox Hills Sandstone. The rocks above the lower 400 ft of the formation are mostly of coastal swamp origin (Roehler, 1983). The rocks of bay and coastal swamp origins in the formation are similar in that in both environments they are mostly interbedded sandstone, siltstone, shale, carbonaceous shale, and coal. They are dissimilar in that the rocks

BAY CYCLES
DEFINITION
The rocks of bay origin in the lower 400 ft of the Lance Formation are composed of sediments of freshwater and brackish-water origins that were deposited cyclically. The term "bay cycle" is herein applied to this type of sedimentation. A bay cycle is defined as "the alternate freshening and salting of bay waters as a result of coastal emergence and submergence,

The repetition of lithologic units in the bay cycles occurs in a rhythmic manner, which suggests that the cycles were periodic and climate related. Although supporting data are lacking, the cycles appear to be the result of climate fluctuations brought about by periodic changes in the Earth's orbit and rotation. I believe that they primarily reflect the cycle of the precession of the equinoxes the noncentric path taken by the polar axis of the Earth as it revolves around the ecliptic pole. Such climate changes would be similar to the climate changes of the Pleistocene glacialinterglacial periods described by Milankovitch (1941). The cycle of the precession of the equinoxes has a period that averages about 21,000 years (Fischer, 1986), and this length of time probably corresponds to the average time required to complete a bay cycle. Fourteen bay cycles are identified in the lower part of the Lance Formation in the U.S. Geological Survey BC No. 1 corehole located in NW'ANW'ANE'A sec. 4, T. 19 N., R. 100 W. (pi. 3).
The emergent stages of the bay cycles are believed to represent warm and wet climate periods of the precessional cycle and the submergent stages are believed to represent cool and dry climate periods of the precessional cycle. If coastal subsidence in the study area during the Late Cretaceous occurred at a fairly constant rate ranging from about 0.5 to 1.5

28 FOX HILLS SANDSTONE, LEWIS SHALE, LANCE FORMATION, SOUTHWEST WYOMING

inches every 100 years (Roehler, 1990, p. 12), then the emergent stages (the warm and wet periods) were times of increased rates of sedimentation, rapid bay infilling, freshening of the bay waters, and influx of freshwater fauna and flora. The opposite lithologic and biologic relationships would characterize submergent stages of the bay cycle.
If bay cycles reflect the cycle of the precession of the equinoxes, then the total time required to deposit barrier shoreline No. 2 was about 84,000 years. This length of time is indicated by the fact that there are four coal beds (or four bay cycles of 21,000 years each) in the rocks of bay-fill origin overlying barrier shoreline No.l up to and including the Hall coal bed (measured sections 3-5, pi. 2). The rocks of bay-fill origin in this interval were deposited contemporaneously with barrier shoreline No. 2.
STAGES OF DEVELOPMENT
The freshwater stages of the bay cycles ultimately resulted in the deposition of coal, and the brackishwater stages ultimately resulted in the deposition of bay-fill shale. Spaced between these lithologic units are beds of sandstone and siltstone deposited in interdistributary splays and carbonaceous shale deposited in reed swamps (pi. 3). Sandstones deposited as stream-channel fill are rare in the section, but are present at widely spaced locations. Five stages of development (A to E) of a bay cycle with their corresponding lithologies are illustrated in figure 43: (A) Saline- to brackish-water bay-fill shale that may contain oyster shells, splay sandstones, or concretions; (B) freshwater to brackish-water reed swamp carbonaceous shale; (C) freshwater forest swamp coal: (D) freshwater to brackish-water reed swamp carbonaceous shale; and (E) saline to brackish-water bay-fill shale that may contain oyster shells, splay sandstones, or concretions. Changing salinities of bay waters during these stages are evidenced by beds alternately containing freshwater and brackish-water fossils. The identification of fossils and detailed descriptions of lithologies in the U.S. Geological Survey BC No. 1 corehole appear in appendix B.
The five stages of development of bay cycles are illustrated in plan view by simplified maps in figure 44. Note that views A and E and views B and D of figure 44 are similar in appearance, but they represent different periods of submergence and emergence.
Figures 45 and 46 illustrate the development of a bay cycle three dimensionally using block diagrams. The block diagrams show the manner in which the lithologic units that compose the cycles were deposited as mud, carbonaceous mud, and peat. Similar depositional environments and their corresponding sediments are common in bays located behind barrier

Bay cycles are readily discernible along outcrops of the lower part of the Lance Formation in the study area. The lithologies of the lower 10 bay cycles in the formation are illustrated in a columnar section (pi. 4) constructed from measured section 104 (pis. 1, 2). Bay cycle No. 7 on plate 4 has been enlarged to illustrate the lithologies, depositional environments, and stages of the cycle. A photograph of outcrops of bay cycle No. 3 in measured section 101 (pis. 1, 2) clearly illustrates the bay cycle lithologic relationships (fig. 48).

CHEMISTRY OE BAY WATERS
The water in the coastal bays during deposition of the lower part of the Lance Formation appears to have undergone chemical changes between the bay margins and the interior parts of the bays. These changes took place as the waters from freshwater

streams entering the bays mixed with the brackish bay waters. The results of this mixing are revealed in the rocks by the composition and lateral distribution of dolomite and hematite concretions. Dolomite concretions commonly overlie the sandstone and siltstone deposited at distal ends of the splays along the former bay margins (fig. 49). Farther into the former bay areas, the splay sandstone and siltstone disappear, but the dolomite concretions remain (fig. 50). Still farther into the former bay areas, the dolomite concretions are overlain by and are eventually replaced by hematite concretions (fig. 51). And, eventually, the hematite concretions thin and wedge out into bay-fill shales (fig. 52). These relationships are illustrated schematically in figure 53. The distribution of the dolomite and hematite concretions is undoubtedly the result of chemical reactions that took place when fresh, carbonate-, iron-, and humateladen, acidic, negatively charged surface waters entering the bays mixed with brackish, sodiumchloride-laden, positively charged bay waters. During the chemical reactions that followed, calcium carbonate was precipitated first (probably as calcite, later altered to dolomite) and then iron was precipitated (probably as iron carbonate, later altered to hematite).

IMPORTANCE OF BAY CYCLES IN COM, EXPLORATION
The coal beds at 234.3-242.8 ft and 322.5-330.6 ft in the BC No. 1 corehole (pi. 3), each more than 8 ft thick, are minable. The heating values of these coal beds range between 8,500 Btu/lb and 10,400 Btu/lb on an as-received basis (unpublished data). The ash content generally ranges from 3 percent to 6 percent

and the sulfur content is less than 1 percent. The upper and lower parts of these coal beds have higher ash and sulfur contents and lower heating values than the middle parts of the beds. It appears from these relationships that the quality of the coal of freshwater origin in the lower and upper parts of the coal beds was diminished as a result of contact with overlying and underlying carbonaceous shale beds of brackish-water origin. Whether these changes in coal quality were syngenetic or diagenetic has not been determined.
Bay cycles have been observed by me not only in the Lance Formation on the east flank of the Rock Springs uplift but also in other Cretaceous rocks

Sandstone beds in the Fox Hills Sandstone and lower part of the Lance Formation are mostly litharenites composed of 40-75 percent quartz, with lesser amounts of chert, feldspar, muscovite, and various rock fragments. They generally contain from 1 to 3 percent heavy minerals consisting of mostly zircon, tourmaline, garnet, and rutile. Cementing materials are hematite, calcite, and an unidentified white clay.
The texture of the sandstones was primarily determined by their depositional environment. Eight sandstone samples were collected for petrographic analysis from outcrops in measured section 52 (pis. 1, 2). The stratigraphic positions of these samples (lettered A to H) are shown in a columnar section (fig. 54). Photomicrographs of the samples are shown in figure 55; letters of the views in figure 55 correspond to letters of the samples in figure 54. Samples shown in views A and B (fig. 55), from the lower shoreface and lower part of the middle shoreface lithofacies of barrier shoreline No. 2 in the Fox Hills Sandstone (pi. 2), are composed of silt with some intermixed grains of very

fine to fine sand, which is fairly well sorted. These two samples are typical of quiet, deep-water sediments deposited seaward of the barrier shorelines. The size of the sand grains in barrier shoreline No. 2 increases to very fine to medium and the grains are poorly sorted in overlying, nearshore parts of the middle shoreface lithofacies (sample C; fig. 55C) and in an ebb-tidal delta (sample D; fig. 55D) at the top of the barrier shoreline (pi. 2). The sand grains in sample E, figure 55E, are medium to coarse, angular to subrounded, and reflect a terrestrial source of sediments and the high energy associated with tidal currents flowing through Jim inlet (pi. 2). Samples F and G (fig. 55F, G) are very fine to fine grained, they are poorly sorted, and they characterize splay sandstones deposited in quiet-water bay area in the lower part of the Lance Formation. Sample H (fig. 55H) is mostly fine grained and poorly sorted, typical of the sandstone beds deposited in distributary stream channels.
The change in color from brown and tan in the lower and middle shoreface parts of the Fox Hills Sandstone to gray and white in the upper shoreface parts of the Fox Hills Sandstone that forms the "white cap" (fig. 17) was examined by Hickling (1991). Hickling studied the petrology of the Fox Hills Sandstone in four sections that he measured and sampled in T. 20 N., R. 100 W. The sections are located between measured sections 78 and 94 (pis. 1 and 2). Hickling (1991, p. 6) found that the brown and tan sandstone beds of the lower and middle shoreface average 2'/2 times the matrix of the white-cap sandstone beds and that the matrix of the brown and tan sandstone beds contains large amounts of argillaceous hematite and dolomite that are missing in the white-cap sandstone beds. Hickling (1991, p. 12-13) accounted for these mineralogical differences by the fact that during deposition most clay and matrix-size materials would have been kept in suspension longer and transported farther seaward from shoreline areas into deeper waters of the middle and lower shoreface. Thus the brown and tan colors of the middle and lower shore-

face primarily result from the brown pigmentation produced by hematite, which is missing in the gray and white upper shoreface sandstone beds. Hickling (1991, p. 14) discounted the possibility that leaching by organic acids derived from overlying coal beds could have led to the removal or alteration of iron pigments to produce the white-cap sandstone beds. Although they were not studied by Hickling, the brown and tan colors imparted to sandstone beds in the lower part of the Lance Formation are probably also the result of iron (hematite) pigmentation.
CORRELATION OF SURFACE SECTIONS AND DRILL HOLES
Stratigraphic correlations of the Fox Hills Sandstone and overlying and underlying formations of Late Cretaceous age from the east flank of the Rock Springs uplift eastward into the Great Divide and Washakie basins are illustrated on plate 5. The correlations begin at measured sections in the study area, which are correlated into the subsurface with electric logs of oil and gas drill holes.
Correlation B-B' (pi. 5) begins at Potash Wash on the northeast flank of the uplift and trends 25 mi northeastward to Red Lake located in the western part of the Great Divide basin (pi. 1). At Potash Wash (No. 1, pi. 5; measured section 23, pi. 2), the Fox Hills Sandstone is composed of barrier shorelines Nos. 1 and 2. These shoreline units correlate northeastward to where they intertongue with and are replaced laterally by coal-bearing rocks of bay origin in the Lance Formation between the Chandler and Simpson Pierson No. 2 dry hole (No. 5, pi. 5) and the Davis Oil Company Olshansky No. 1 dry hole (No. 6, pi. 5). Barrier shoreline No. 1 on correlation diagram B-B' is partly underlain by a third, unnumbered barrier shoreline sandstone that is missing in outcrops at Potash Wash but is well developed in the Davis Oil Company Garfield No. 1-Z dry hole (No. 2, pi. 5)

Most of the upper part of the Lewis Shale on correlation diagram B-B' consists of marine sandstone and siltstone that compose the Red Desert delta. These delta sediments thicken in the subsurface in a northeast direction across the Great Divide basin toward the center of the delta, but thin and wedge out in a southwest direction toward the outcrops on the northeast flank of the Rock Springs uplift. The southwestern wedgeout of the delta sediments occurs between the Davis Oil Company Garfield No. 1-Z dry hole and the measured section at Potash Wash.
The Almond Formation underlies and intertongues with the Lewis Shale on correlation diagram B-B'. The Almond Formation consists of barrier shoreline sandstones (stippled) and underlying coal-bearing rocks of bay and coastal swamp origins.

Barrier sandstones of shorelines Nos. 2 and 3 (pi. 2) crop out near Hallville Station. Barrier shoreline No. 2 wedges out in the Lewis Shale a few miles northeast of Hallville Station between the Prenalta Corporation No. 13-4-20-99 gas well (No. 11, pi. 5) and the Mesa Petroleum Company No. 6-1 gas well (No. 12, pi. 5). Barrier shoreline No. 3 (pi. 2) can be correlated from outcrops near Hallville Station across the length of correlation diagram C-C'. A third, unnumbered barrier shoreline sandstone of the Fox Hills Sandstone is present above barrier shoreline No. 3 northeast of the Union Pacific Railroad Hallville No. 44-9D gas well (No. 9, pi. 5). This shoreline sandstone intertongues with and is replaced by coal-bearing rocks of bay origin in the Lance Formation southwest of the Union Pacific Railroad No. 41-5 gas well (No. 10, pi. 5).
The Lewis Shale on correlation diagram C-C' consists of mostly marine sandstone and siltstone that make up the Red Desert delta. The delta sediments thin and are replaced by marine shale in a southeast direction between Nos. 8 and 14 on correlation diagram C-C'.
The Almond Formation on correlation diagram C-C' is composed of barrier shoreline sandstones (stippled) that intertongue with the Lewis Shale in its upper part and with coal-bearing rocks of bay and coastal

measured section 149, pi. 2). Barrier shoreline No. 2 is composed of lower shoreface sandstones that thin and wedge out eastward into the Lewis Shale. Barrier shoreline No. 3 consists of thick shoreface sandstones along outcrops near Black Buttes Station that are split into upper and lower parts separated by a thin bed of marine shale. Only thin remnants of barrier shorelines Nos. 2 and 3 remain at Table Rock field (No. 19, pi. 5). A third, unnumbered barrier shoreline sandstone is present above barrier shoreline No. 3 in the Davis Oil Company Champlin-Rock Springs No. 1 dry hole (No. 18, pi. 5), and this barrier shoreline continues from the dry hole eastward to Table Rock field. The unnumbered barrier shoreline sandstone in correlation diagram D-D' corresponds to the unnumbered barrier shoreline sandstone on correlation diagram C-C"; it is missing in correlation diagram B-B''.
The Lewis Shale in correlation diagram D-D' is composed of mostly nearshore marine shale with three thin interbedded remnants of Red Desert delta sandstone and siltstone that wedge out in a westward direction across the correlation diagram.
The Almond Formation in correlation diagram D-D' thickens from about 290 ft in outcrops near Black Buttes Station (No. 15, pi. 5) to about 375 ft at Table Rock field (No. 19, pi. 5). Near Black Buttes Station the formation is composed of coal-bearing rocks of bay and coastal swamp origins; at Table Rock field two barrier shoreline sandstones (stippled) overlie the rocks of bay and coastal swamp origins. The uppermost of these barrier shoreline sandstones (Nos. IT19, pi. 5) is the producing interval at Patrick Draw field. Conformably underlying the Almond Formation are sandstones of alluvial plain origin that make up the Ericson Sandstone.
Correlation E-E' (pi. 5) extends from outcrops in the Dry Canyon area in sees. 28 and 29, T. 15 N., R. 102 W., near the south end of the Rock Springs uplift, 15 mi southeast to the Grynberg and Associates Trail No. 1-27 dry hole located in sec. 27, T. 14 N., R. 100 W. In outcrops in the Dry Canyon area (No. 20, pi. 5), the Lance Formation, Fox Hills Sandstone, and upper part of the Lewis Shale were removed by erosion along the Laramide unconformity at the Cretaceous-Tertiary boundary. The Laramide unconformity rises stratigraphically, and the underlying Cretaceous rocks thicken toward the southeast across correlation diagram E-E'. Where the Fox Hills Sandstone first appears below the unconformity, between the British-American Oil Company Dymond No. 1 dry hole (No. 22, pi. 5) and the General Petroleum Company Salt Wells No. 58-24 dry hole (No. 23, pi. 5), it consists of barrier shoreline No. 3 and an

unnamed overlying barrier sandstone. The Red Desert delta in the Lewis Shale does not extend as far south as correlation diagram E-E'.
The Almond Formation, which was only about 300 ft thick in outcrops near Black Buttes Station in correlation diagram D-D' (No. 15, pi. 5), thickens to nearly 800 ft in the Dry Creek area in correlation diagram E-E' (No. 20, pi. 5). The Almond Formation in correlation diagram E-E', as in the other correlations, consists of barrier shoreline sandstones (stippled) and coastal swamp deposits, which conformably overlie the sandstones of alluvial plain origin that make up the Ericson Sandstone.
REGIONAL PALEOGEOGRAPHY OF THE FOX HILLS SANDSTONE IN THE ROCK SPRINGS
UPLIFT AREA DURING MAXIMUM MARINE TRANSGRESSION
The embayed western shoreline of the interior seaway during the Maastrichtian Age of the Late Cretaceous, at the time of maximum westward marine transgression of the seaway, is shown in figure 56. The shoreline at that time completely encircled the submerged and featureless Rock Springs uplift area (Roehler, 1990, pi. 2K). A large lobate delta, the Red Desert delta, was present along the northeast, seaward edge of the embayment, and a smaller lobate delta was present at the southeast edge of the embayment near the present-day boundary of Wyoming, Utah, and Colorado (fig. 56). The sedimentladen distributary streams that flowed from these deltas spread marine sandstones in southwest and northeast directions across the shallow mouth of the embayment.
The barrier shorelines of the Fox Hills Sandstone in the study area represent progressive stages of infilling and abandonment of the embayment shown in figure 56. Stratigraphic evidence suggests that the Red Desert delta was abandoned and that the delta area was covered by marine sediments prior to the time of deposition of barrier shorelines Nos. 1-3 in the study area.
PALEOGEOGRAPHY OF BARRIER SHORELINES NOS. 1-3 OF THE FOX HILLS SANDSTONE ON THE
EAST FLANK OF THE ROCK SPRINGS UPLIFT
A segment of barrier shoreline No. 1 is preserved in outcrops (measured sections 1-43, pi. 2) on the northeast flank of the Rock Springs uplift and in subsurface rocks east of the uplift (B-B', pi. 5). The shoreline in those areas was arcuate and trended

west to southwest (fig. 57). The southwest trend of the shoreline in the study area probably changed to nearly north-south across the central part of the Rock Springs uplift, where the Fox Hills Sandstone has been removed by late Tertiary and Holocene erosion. The Fox Hills Sandstone is also missing in surface and subsurface rocks at the south end of the uplift, because of Late Cretaceous (Laramide) erosion across the axis of the uplift.
Barrier shoreline No. 2 consists of mostly shoreface sandstone and parts of a flood-tidal delta and ebbtidal delta in outcrops in the study area (pi. 2). The trend of the barrier shoreline is similar to that of barrier shoreline No. 1, but it is offset to the southeast as a result of the regression and infilling of the

interior seaway (fig. 58). The trend of barrier shoreline No. 2 in subsurface rocks east of the Rock Springs uplift can be determined by correlating the geophysical logs of drill holes (B-Bf, C-C', and D-D',
pi. 5). A long, linear section of barrier shoreline No. 3
crops out in the study area, because the facies strike of the barrier shoreline closely parallels the trend of outcrops of the Fox Hills Sandstone along the east flank of the Rock Springs uplift. Because of this parallelism, it is possible to reconstruct a large part of the barrier shoreline morphology, including the length and trend of barrier islands and the configura-
tion of bays, inlets, and sounds.

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS

39

Barrier shoreline No. 3 appears to bulge in an eastward (seaward) direction along the middle part of the east flank of the Rock Springs uplift. This bulge is believed to indicate the presence of a delta of which Salley sound, Black Butte inlet, and South inlet are tidally influenced distributary channels. As the landward parts of barrier shoreline No. 3 in the area have been removed by late Tertiary and Holocene erosion across the uplift, the precise configuration of the delta remains problematical, even though current direction and sedimentary structure data support the interpretation shown in figure 59.
Jim inlet is located at the place where the general north-south trend of barrier shoreline No. 3 swings eastward away from the Rock Springs uplift into the

Great Divide basin. Landward of the barrier islands in the vicinity of Jim inlet was a large bay or lagoon in which the Hall coal bed was deposited (fig. 59). The barrier island between Jim inlet and Salley sound trended south-southeast and was about 5 mi long. A small tidal inlet at the south end of this barrier island separated the main part of this island from Salley sound. Salley sound was primarily a mud-bottomed opening between the barrier islands of shoreline No. 3. The barrier island between Salley sound and Black Butte inlet trended nearly northsouth and was slightly more than 2 mi long. The barrier island between Black Butte inlet and South inlet trended south-southwest and was about 5 mi long. In subsurface rocks south of South inlet, barrier shoreline No. 3 is missing by erosion, but remnants of the barrier shoreline are present below the unconformity
a few miles farther south (E-E', pi. 5).

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS

FIGURE 59. Paleogeographic map of barrier shoreline No. 3 of the Fox Hills Sandstone, east flank of the Rock Springs uplift. The marine shoreline is stippled. Details of Jim inlet, Black Butte inlet, South inlet, and Salley sound are shown in figures 27, 30, 31, and 33. Parts of shoreline restoration are hypothetical.

The Fox Hills Sandstone, Lewis Shale, and Lance Formation were deposited along the western margins of the interior Cretaceous seaway of North America. During the Maastrichtian Age of the Late Cretaceous, the sea retreated from its western shores, including an embayed segment of the shoreline that covered the Rock Springs uplift area. As the sea retreated eastward and evacuated this embayment, progressive offlapping of shoreline sandstones occurred. Three of these offlapping shoreline sandstones crop out in the study area along the east flank of the Rock Springs uplift as the Fox Hills Sandstone. The three shorelines were wave dominated, but were subjected to moderately high tides estimated to range between 4 ft and 10 ft. The tidal range is probably higher than normal for the interior seaway, but it can be explained by the focusing effect that resulted from the convergence of the tidal currents as they approached the head of the embayment that covered the Rock Springs uplift area. The sedimentary structures and configuration of the shoreline sandstones indicate that dominant longshore currents and sediment transport directions were north to south.
Continental rocks of bay or lagoon origin that overlie and intertongue with the three offlapping shorelines of the Fox Hills Sandstone form the basal part of the Lance Formation. Marine rocks that intertongue with and underlie the Fox Hills Sandstone make up the Lewis Shale. The ammonite index fossil Baculites dinolobatus was collected from the upper part of the Lewis Shale in the study area, which dates the formations as lower Maastrichtian.

40 FOX HILLS SANDSTONE, LEWIS SHALE, LANCE FORMATION, SOUTHWEST WYOMING

The three offlapping shorelines that form the Fox Hills Sandstone consist of chains of barrier islands. The barrier islands were generally from 3 to 7 mi long and were separated by tidal inlets and a sound. From north to south along the line of outcrops, these coastal features were named: (1) North inlet, (2) Jim inlet, (3) Salley sound, (4) Black Butte inlet, and (5) South inlet. Associated with the inlets and sound were large flood-tidal deltas, ebb-tidal deltas, and accretionary swash bars.
The rocks that compose most of the barrier shorelines of the Fox Hills Sandstone can be divided into ascending sequences of lower, middle, and upper shoreface lithofacies. The lower shoreface lithofacies consists of mostly thin, ridge- and bench-forming, tan, very fine to fine-grained sandstone that occurs in thin, parallel beds. Interbedded with the sandstone are beds of slope-forming, thick to thin, gray, soft shale. The middle shoreface lithofacies consists of mostly cliff- and ledge-forming, tan, very fine to medium-grained sandstone that occurs in thick parallel beds, in large-scale hummocky trough crossbeds, or in massive, bioturbated beds. The upper shoreface lithofacies weathers to a distinct "white cap" along the top of the Fox Hills outcrops. It can be divided into a lower surf zone and an upper forebeach zone. The surf zone consists of mostly light gray, fine- to medium-grained sandstone that occurs in small-scale trough and planar crossbeds. The forebeach zone is similar to the surf zone in color and texture, but it occurs in thin, parallel, tabular beds. The color change of tan sandstone in the lower and middle shoreface lithofacies to white cap sandstone in the upper shoreface lithofacies is attributed to the brown pigmentation imparted by hematite in the tan sandstone, which is missing in the white cap sandstone.
The basal part of the Lance Formation is composed of mostly tan, hematitic, fine-grained sandstone deposited as fluvial channels and splays, which is interbedded with gray shale of bay-fill origin, gray and brown carbonaceous shale of swamp origin, and coal of peat bog origin. The basal part of the formation was deposited rhythmically in bay cycles. Bay cycles are defined as the alternate freshening and salting of bay waters as a result of coastal emergence and submergence, which caused repetitive changes in the type and distribution of lithologic units and fauna and flora. The freshwater stages of bay cycles are characterized by interbedded carbonaceous shale and coal. The saltwater and brackish-water stages are characterized by interbedded shale, sandstone, and siltstone. Fourteen bay cycles were identified in the basal part of the Lance Formation in the study area. The cycles are believed to be related to the

21,000 year cycle of the precession of the equinoxes, which affected rates of coastal sedimentation. The changing water chemistries of the bay waters during the cycles caused the deposition of calcium carbonate in nearshore, freshwater parts of the bays and iron carbonate in deeper, more saline parts of the bays.
Coal beds in the basal part of the Lance Formation are mostly lenticular and range in thickness from less than 1 to about 8 ft. The Hall coal bed that overlies the Fox Hills Sandstone contains numerous splits and partings and is diachronous. The coal beds in the Lance Formation are mostly subbituminous, and many of the thicker beds are minable.
Stratigraphic correlations and paleogeographic reconstructions of the shorelines of the Fox Hills Sandstone suggest that intervals of marine shale that are present between shorelines No. 1 and No. 2 and No. 2 and No. 3 were probably deposited during periods of stillstand and do not reflect major marine transgressions. Barrier shoreline No. 1 had a semicircular configuration, open to the east, with the westernmost parts of the shoreline located near the center of the present-day Rock Springs uplift. Barrier shoreline No. 2 had a similar configuration but was located across the east flank of the Rock Springs uplift area. Barrier shoreline No. 3 was more irregular in shape; its western parts parallel the outcrops of the Fox Hills Sandstone along the east flank of the Rock Springs uplift.
