GEOPHYSICAL LOGS AND COAL SECTIONS FOR TWO HOLES DRILLED IN THE WASATCH PLATEAU COAL FIELD, MAHOGANY POINT QUADRANGLE, EMERY COUNTY, UTAH

By Eugene G. Ellis

INTRODUCTION Two holes, for a total of 3,191 ft, were drilled in the Wasatch Plateau coal field, Emery County, Utah, from July through November 1980, by XL Drilling, Inc., under contract no. 14-08-0001-18780 awarded by the U.S. Geological Survey. The purpose of the drilling was to obtain information on the thickness, quality, and extent of the. coal in the Cretaceous Blackhawk Formation, and on the lithology of the surrounding rocks. The project was part of the U.S. Geological Survey's continuing program to evaluate and classify Federal coal lands in the public domain. Drilling was done in the Trail Mountain area, Mahogany Point quadrangle, Utah, using a truck-mounted rotary drilling rig. Drilling media were air, injected water, foam, and mud. Permission to drill was granted by officials of the Manti-LaSal National Forest, U.S. Forest Service, Price, Utah. Locations of the holes are shown in figure 1. The drill holes were logged by Southwest Surveys, Farmington, New Mexico (table 1). Gamma ray, density, caliper, and resistance logs were run on hole TM-3 (fig. 4). Gamma ray, density, and caliper logs were run on hole TM-17A (fig. 5); a resistance log was not run owing to unsatisfactory hole conditions. Detailed gamma ray, density, and caliper logs were run on part of hole TM-17A. The Hiawatha coal zone (Spieker, 1931) penetrated in these holes is correlated with the same zone of adjacent holes drilled in 1975 by the Utah Geological and Mineral Survey (Davis and Doelling, 1976) in cooperation with the U.S. Geological Survey (figs. 2 and 3). All measurements are in feet; to convert to meters, multiply by 0.3048.
