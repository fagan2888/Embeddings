Abstract
The Neogene Crater Flat basin, an extensional structural domain straddling the margin of the southeastern Walker Lane belt, is characterized by closely spaced NNEstriking normal faults that bound moderately ESE-tilted fault blocks including Yucca Mountain, a potential site for the nation's high-level waste repository. Detailed knowledge of the kinematic history of extensional faults in the basin is needed to help constrain regional Neogene tectonic models of the Yucca Mountain region, which, in turn, provide a long-term context for Quaternary seismic and volcanic hazards evaluations. The present investigation focuses on the northern flank of Crater Flat basin where nearly continuous Miocene bedrock exposures of fault blocks exist along a NWtrending belt continuing from northern Yucca Mountain to the northwest corner of the Crater Flat domain, permitting evaluation of space-time patterns of fault kinematics along a cross-basinal transect.
A total of 321 fault-slip measurements were made at 65 sites in 13.5-11.6-Ma volcanic rocks exposed along the northern flank of Crater Flat. Additional constraints were provided by paleomagnetic data from 23 new sites and 40 previously reported sites in 13.25-11.45-Ma rocks exposed throughout the basin. All of these fault-slip and paleomagnetic data are presented in this report. Most measured faults strike N to NE and dip W to NW. Most N-striking faults crosscut NE-striking faults. Normal to normaloblique fault slip is dominant; rake angles are rarely less than 45° and most exceed 70°. To help delineate space-time changes of fault kinematics and to investigate paleostress patterns, the study area was spatially partitioned into 10 subdomains and fault-slip data from each were inverted to find one or more best-fit reduced stress tensors. Consistent crosscutting relations of overprinted fault striae guided determinations of slip data subsets for subdomain multiple inversions, and helped to identify the relative timing of paleostress tensors.
Results indicate that during major extensional development of Crater Flat basin between 12.7 and 11.6 Ma a normal-slip fault/stress regime prevailed across the northern flank where the least principal stress direction (a3) was uniformly oriented about 300°. A localized radial shift of a3 about the nearby Claim Canyon caldera occurred during the caldera's development early in this episode. Stress tensor configurations and an angular unconformity beneath the 11.6-Ma Rainier Mesa Tuff indicate that normal faults were tilted along with adjacent strata during the major extensional episode. The style of faulting changed between 11.6 and 11.45 Ma from dominantly normal slip to normaloblique slip in the northern basin even though the overall stress configuration did not change significantly (i.e., cjj vertical, a3 azimuth -300°). The oblique faulting was characterized by sinistral slip components on NE-striking faults and dextral slip components on N-striking faults, regardless of fault dip direction. Paleomagnetic data mostly indicate southwest-increasing and -younging clockwise vertical-axis rotations of fault blocks across the Crater Flat basin beginning between about 11.6 and 11.45 Ma, thus defining a north-northwest-trending rotational strain gradient that spans the length of the basin. These data and other structural constraints indicate that oblique faulting accommodated as much as -25° of clockwise inclined-axis rotations of fault blocks in northern Crater Flat basin. In contrast to the overall basin, the fault-block rotation

episode in the north was somewhat diachronous and not uniformly westward younging. The most likely cause for the change to oblique extension was an abrupt pulse of broadly distributed, heterogeneous dextral shear across this part of the Walker Lane belt. Thus, Crater Flat basin appears to be an extensional graben that was overprinted by a dextral shear couple as much as 1 m.y. after the majority of the basin had formed. Southwest a3 orientations compatible with younger(?) normal fault slip in some subdomains may reflect the late influence of a radial stress envelope associated with the 11.6-11.45-Ma Timber Mountain caldera. This and other studies in the region suggest that pre-9-Ma regional c3 trajectories curved sharply across the Crater Flat structural basin from westsouthwest Basin-and-Range orientations in the east to west-northwest orientations in the west along the margin of the Walker Lane belt. The calderas along the north boundary of the Crater Flat basin may have acted as a stress guide that confined the margin of the Walker Lane belt in the Miocene and influenced the curving of stress trajectories across the basin.
Introduction
Crater Flat basin is located in southern Nevada within the southwestern Great Basin. It is situated along the diffuse boundary between the Basin and Range and Walker Lane belt tectonic provinces and lies within the southern part of the Miocene southwest Nevada volcanic field (Fig. 1). The present study was undertaken primarily to provide fault-kinematic constraints for Neogene tectonic models of the Crater Flat basin structural domain, which includes Yucca Mountain, the potential site of the high-level radioactive waste repository. Fault-slip and paleomagnetic data provided in this report, and the resulting tectonic interpretations, in turn, provide geologic input for seismic and volcanic hazards assessments of Yucca Mountain and its environs. Fault-slip investigations in this study focus on the northern flank of Crater Flat basin where: (1) the local geology has been mapped in detail at 1:12,000 scale (Fridrich and others, 1994; C.J. Fridrich, unpub. data), (2) excellent bedrock exposures of concentrated meso- and map-scale faults exist across the entire basin flank, (3) widespread, well-dated, late Miocene regional ash-flow tuffs of the southwest Nevada volcanic field provide temporal control and permit paleomagnetic assessments of vertical-axis fault-block rotations; and (4) an adjacent late Miocene caldera complex allows for evaluation of possible caldera-magmatic effects on faulting (Fig. 1). The current study includes a paleostress analysis of the fault-slip data, the results of which are used, together with the paleomagnetic results, to aid faultkinematic interpretations of Crater Flat basin. These results are also used to: (1) derive the Miocene paleostress history of the basin, (2) determine possible volcano-tectonic controls on the fault pattern in the northern part of the basin, and (3) assess the influence of Walker Lane dextral shear on the evolution of the basin.
This study largely builds upon recent geologic studies of the Crater Flat basin conducted principally by C.J. Fridrich through the U.S. Geological Survey's Yucca Mountain Project. These definitive studies include detailed (1:12,000-scale) geologic mapping of the northern part of the basin (Fridrich and others, 1994; C.J. Fridrich, unpub. data) and tectonic syntheses of the Crater Flat basin structural domain (Fridrich, in press; Fridrich and others, in press). Earlier important Neogene structural and tectonic

investigations in the Crater Flat domain mostly focused on Yucca Mountain. Of these investigations, those most relevant to the present study consist of the fault-slip study of Scott and Hofland (1987), the lineament and kinematic analysis of O'Neill and others (1991), the paleomagnetic studies of Rosenbaum and others (1991) and Hudson and others (1994), the joint study of Throckmorton and Verbeek (1995), the tectonic analysis of Scott (1990), and the tectonic modelling of King and Janssen (1994).
Geologic Setting
The Crater Flat basin, viewed as a structural domain, is a north-trending graben that is bounded on the east by the concealed down-to-the-west Gravity fault, on the west by the opposing Bare Mountain range-front fault, and on the north by the transverse Yucca Wash fault and the Timber Mountain/Claim Canyon caldera complex (Fig. 2; Fridrich, in press); the southern end of the graben is poorly constrained due to burial by younger deposits of the Amargosa basin. The eastern part of the domain is dominated by the multiple-fault-block ridge of Yucca Mountain whereas most of the western part is dominated by the alluvial flat physiographic basin known as Crater Flat. The northnortheast-trending fault blocks characterizing the interior of the Crater Flat graben mostly consist of 13.5-11.45-Ma tuffs and lavas that are gently tilted to the east-southeast and are bounded by west-northwest-dipping normal faults (Fig. 2). The main extensional development of the graben occurred between emplacement of two regional ash-flow tuff sheets in the area at 12.7 Ma and 11.6 Ma, resulting in a laterally persistent angular unconformity within the volcanic section (Fridrich and others, in press). Paleomagnetic data spanning the length of Yucca Mountain indicate that the mountain's arcuate southern "tail" (Fig. 2) resulted from a southward increase in clockwise vertical-axis rotation of fault blocks during extension (Rosenbaum and others, 1991; Hudson and others, 1994). This clockwise rotation was likely due to southwestward-increasing extension and dextral shear associated with the southeastern Walker Lane belt (Scott, 1990; Rosenbaum and others, 1991; Hudson and others, 1994; Fridrich, in press). Crater Flat basin has been characterized by a strong southwestward increase in magnitude of extension throughout its tectonic development, which has continued up to the present. As such, the overall basin has formed by oblique extension (Fridrich and others, in press).
The stratigraphy of the northern Crater Flat study area is characterized by a sequence of Miocene ash-flow tuffs and related lavas and pyroclastic rocks of the southwest Nevada volcanic field that unconformably overlie Paleozoic sedimentary rocks exposed at the northeast end of Bare Mountain (Fig. 3; Fridrich and others, 1994; C.J. Fridich, unpub. data). The oldest significant Miocene volcanic rocks in the study area are rocks of the 13.5-13.1-Ma Crater Flat Group (map unit Tc, Fig. 3), which consist of (in ascending order) the Tram Tuff, the rhyolite lavas and tuffs of Prospector Pass, the Bullfrog Tuff, and the Prow Pass Tuff. These rocks are overlain by 12.9-Ma tuffs of the Calico Hills Formation, which, in turn, are overlain by 12.8-12.7-Ma ash-flow tuffs of the Paintbrush Group (unit Tp). Eruption of the Paintbrush rocks, which consist of (in ascending order) the Topopah Spring, Pah Canyon, Yucca Mountain, and Tiva Canyon Tuffs, formed the Claim Canyon caldera along the northern boundary of the Crater Flat basin (Fig. 3). Paintbrush rocks are resurgently domed in the central part of the caldera

and are onlapped by 12.5-Ma tuffs and lavas of Windy Wash (unit Tmn) within the caldera moat. An angular unconformity exists between the Paintbrush rocks and the overlying 11.7-Ma rhyolite of Fluorspar Canyon and 11.6-Ma Rainier Mesa Tuff (unit Tm) on the north flank of Crater Flat; the angular discordance ranges from about 10° at Yucca Mountain to 40° at the west end of Tram Ridge (Fridrich, in press). This unconformity is a consequence of the major extensional fault-block tilting that occurred throughout the basin between 12.7 and 11.7 Ma. Emplacement of the voluminous Rainier Mesa Tuff resulted in initial collapse of the Timber Mountain caldera complex along the north edge of the study area and partial obliteration of the older Claim Canyon caldera (Fig. 2 and 3). Megabreccia deposits of Rainier Mesa Tuff (unit Tmx) in northwestern Crater Flat represent rock avalanches shed off of the east-facing Bare Mountain fault scarp during post-11.6-Ma extension. Eruption of the 11.45-Ma Ammonia Tanks Tuff (unit Tma) resulted in further collapse of the Timber Mountain caldera complex. This tuff and younger volcanic and sedimentary deposits (unit Tgc) are ponded in the caldera complex (Fig. 3). Late Miocene and younger deposits underlie the Crater Flat alluvial basin to the south (unit QTs).
The structural geology of the northern Crater Flat study area differs from that of other exposed parts of the overall basin most noticeably in terms of its fault geometry (Fig. 2). The density of faults is greater at the north end of the basin, and the faults there gradually change in strike from north at the north end of Yucca Mountain to northeast in the Tram Ridge area northwest of Crater Flat, thus defining a crude radial geometry with respect to the Claim Canyon caldera (Fig. 3; Fridrich and others, 1994). Also across this part of the basin stratal tilts also vary from east- to southeast-directed, and in the Tram Ridge area strata locally tilt towards the northwest. Many of the north-striking faults that cut intracaldera rocks of the Claim Canyon caldera continue far southward into the northern Yucca Mountain area whereas many other localized intracaldera faults with arcuate or concentric geometries are probably comagmatic caldera structures (Fig. 3). Three northeast-striking splays of the Bare Mountain fault present along the northwestern margin of Crater Flat basin are interpreted by Fridrich (in press) to each have an unique age range, with the youngest, southeasternmost splay extending discontinuously into young basin-fill deposits in Crater Flat (Fig. 3). The northern Crater Flat extracaldera faults and related structures briefly described above are the main focus of the present study.
Fault-Slip Data
Faults were examined in Miocene volcanic rocks in uplands bordering northern Crater Flat. Fault plane and striae orientations and, where possible, fault separation were measured for exposed map-scale and mesoscale (generally 100 to 0.01 m offset) faults at selected sites. Additionally, slip-sense determinations were made at each fault. Except where faults offset beds or other datums, slip sense mostly was evaluated using secondary-fracture criteria of Petit (1987). Other features revealing slip sense were accretion steps formed by syn-slip mineral deposition and tool marks (Angelier and others, 1985; Petit, 1987). Each determination was assigned a definite, probable, or inferred certainty. For faults with inferred certainty, the slip sense typically was assumed

to be the same as that of nearby, similarly oriented faults having definitive slip sense. The measurement sites (Fig. 4; see also Appendix C) were selected as much as possible to achieve a spatially, temporally, and structurally representative sampling of the faults. Each site consists of one or more outcrops, each of which contains one or more measurable faults. Bedding and foliation attitudes of faulted rocks were measured at most sites mainly to assess the possibility of fault tilt.
Relative and absolute timing of fault movement was determined in the field from cross-cutting relations of faults, slickenside striae, and stratigraphic units. Relative ages of some of the larger measured faults were deduced from fault relations shown on published geologic maps of Fridrich and others (1994; in press). Numerous radiometric ages reported for the faulted rock units (see Sawyer and others, 1994, and references cited within), in combination with observed fault-stratigraphic age relations, served to define the absolute age ranges of fault sets.
The estimated instrumental error for orientation measurements was ±2 , whereas
fault attitude and striae orientation determinations were judged to be within ±8° of the mean local orientations of these features. Thus, the overall measurement accuracy was
about ±10° (cf. Zoback, 1989, p. 7109). A total of 321 fault-slip measurements were made of faults at 65 sites in late
Miocene (13.5-11.6-Ma) tuffs and lavas exposed along the northern margin of the basin (Fig. 4); 103 measurements were made in Crater Flat Group and overlying Calico Hills rocks (map unit Tc), 149 in Paintbrush Group rocks (unit Tp), and 69 in Rainier Mesa Tuff and underlying rhyolite of Flourspar Canyon (unit Tm). Appendices A, B, and C, respectively, contain a detailed listing of the complete fault-slip data set, data plots from each site, and maps showing the location of each site and the associated measurements. As in the mapped fault pattern in northern Crater Flat (Fridrich and others, 1994; in press), most measured faults strike north to northeast with a majority of the faults dipping west to northwest (compare Figs. 3 and 5). Northeast-striking faults tend to terminate against throughgoing north-striking faults (Fig. 3). Normal and normal-oblique modes of slip greatly outnumber all other modes (Fig. 5); strike-slip faults are uncommon, and rake
angles are rarely less than 45° (most exceed 70°). There is no clear spatial pattern in striae plunge direction within the study area. A few contrasts in fault-slip data are apparent by comparing data from rocks of different stratigraphic age ranges. Faults measured in Crater Flat Group rocks and overlying Calico Hills rocks are generally similar to those in younger Paintbrush Group rocks although faults in the older rocks tend to strike more easterly and include a greater variety of fault plane orientations (Figs. 6 and 7). A majority of faults in unconformably overlying Timber Mountain Group rocks (rhyolite of
Fluorspar Canyon and Rainier Mesa Tuff) strike more northerly (less than 20 east of north), dip to the west, and exhibit dextral-oblique slip (Fig. 8). Most lower-rake striae overprint high-rake striae on faults in the Crater Flat and Paintbrush rocks whereas the opposite is true on faults in the Timber Mountain rocks.

Paleomagnetic Results
Rosenbaum and others (1991) and Hudson and others (1994) have previously published paleomagnetic data that indicate that tuffs of the Crater Flat and Paintbrush Groups have been rotated clockwise approximately 25° about near-vertical axes in the area of southern Yucca Mountain. These data also suggest that rotation here began before emplacement of the 11.45-Ma Ammonia Tanks Tuff. For this study, new paleomagnetic data were acquired from 23 sites from the western and northern parts of the Crater Flat basin from the Bullfrog, Tiva Canyon, Rainier Mesa, and Ammonia Tanks Tuffs to refine the spatial distribution and timing of clockwise rotation. Table 1 lists the data from these 23 sites along with previously published data from 40 sites from this area.
Paleomagnetic samples for this study were collected with a portable rock drill and were oriented with a clinometer and both magnetic and solar compassed. At each site, eight to ten samples were collected from outcrops spread over several tens of square meters. Stratal attitudes were averaged from numerous measurements of compaction foliation, under the presumption that compaction foliation was horizontal when the tuffs acquired magnetization. In the laboratory, eight to ten samples from each site were subjected to progressive alternating-field demagnetization consisting of eight steps per sample to peak inductions of 80 mT. Demagnetization results were plotted on orthogonal vector diagrams and directions of magnetic components were determined for visually determined linear segments by principal-component analysis (Kirschvink, 1980). Site means and their dispersion parameters were calculated using statistical methods of Fisher (1953). As in previous studies, samples collected for this study typically responded in an uncomplicated manner to progressive demagnetization. Tuffs at most sites carry one dominant, well-grouped component of magnetization that is interpreted to have been acquired during initial cooling of the unit. Lightning-induced isothermal remanent magnetizations overprinted the characteristic magnetization at some topographically exposed sites. Data from samples for which lightning-induced overprints could not be clearly removed were omitted from statistical calculations.
To detect possible vertical-axis rotation, declinations of tilt-corrected site mean directions were compared to reference directions for each unit (Table 1), as presented by Hudson and others (1994). These reference directions were obtained from sites from the central, least deformed part of the southwestern Nevada volcanic field that is little rotated with respect to the North American craton (Hudson and others, 1994). The declination discordances calculated in this manner for Crater Flat basin and northern Crater Flat basin are illustrated in Figs. 9 and 10, respectively. Tilt-corrected mean directions for those sites that have statistically significant declination discordances (Table 1) generally lie clockwise of their reference directions, implying that they were affected by a clockwise vertical-axis rotation. We must further qualify this conclusion, however, for a few sites that also have inclinations that are strongly discordant from their reference direction, as indicated by flattening (F) values in Table 1. Vertical-axis rotation alone does not affect site mean inclinations and thus other factors must also have influenced the magnetization direction for sites having strong inclination anomalies. In Fig. 9, declination discordances for five sites with inclination discordances exceeding 10° are queried. Two factors probably caused these inclination discordances.

Site is site name; Lat. and Long, are latitude (°N) and longitude (°W) of site; N/No is number of samples accepted/number of samples demagnetized; k is concentration parameter (Fisher, 1953); 095 is ninety five percent
confidence cone about mean; Dg and Ig are declination and inclination of site mean direction in geographic coordinates; St/Dip is strike and dip of site (dip direction 90° clockwise from strike); Ds and Is are declination and inclination of site mean direction in stratigraphic coordinates; R and F are rotation and flattening parameters that indicate differences of tilt-corrected site mean declinations and inclinations, respectively, relative to reference directions, with ninety five percent confidence limits calculated in the manner of Demarest (1983). Reference directions for ash-flow tuffs are from Hudson and others (1994).

Four of the five queried site directions have inclinations that are shallower than the reference directions. Inclination shallowing in tuffs can be produced if vertical compaction during welding continued after the remanent magnetization was blocked by the magnetic carrier grains (Rosenbaum, 1986). Inclination flattening due to vertical compaction does not affect site declinations, however, and thus vertical-axis rotation estimates for sites affected by this process may still be valid. Where such inclination shallowing has been observed in vertical profiles elsewhere in the tuff units studied here (Rosenbaum, 1986; Hudson, 1992, Hudson and others, 1994; Hudson, unpublished data), it is typically less than 10°. However, Rosenbaum (1986) has suggested that inclination shallowing may vary in a non-uniform manner as a function of factors such as unit thickness, volatile content, and tuff emplacement temperature. Several of the new Tiva Canyon Tuff sites in northern Crater Flat basin that have shallow inclinations (94BH-16, 94BH-19, 95BH-20) were sampled in its upper, more mafic, crystal-rich part. We suspect that compaction-related flattening may have affected the inclinations of these sites because of an enhanced emplacement temperature due to the mafic magma composition and the close proximity to the source caldera. Moreover, the declination discordances for these sites are similar to those from nearby sites in older Bullfrog and younger Rainier Mesa Tuffs. A second likely cause for inclination discordance arises from inaccurate tilt correction caused by some primary dip of compaction foliation. Primary dip of compaction foliation might reflect pre-eruption topography generated by extensional faulting or, in the northern part of Crater Flat, by caldera-related deformation. Depending on the geometry of the primary stratal dip, inaccurate tilt corrections can affect the declinations of site mean directions and thus introduce errors into vertical-axis rotation estimates. If, for example, sites inherit eastward primary dips from tilts of preexisting fault blocks, the resultant tilt corrections of the generally north or south trending magnetizations carried by these units will result in declinations that lie clockwise of their proper directions. In this scenario estimates of clockwise rotation will be exaggerated. The resultant declination errors are potentially greatest for magnetizations with steep inclinations, such as the Ammonia Tanks Tuff whose reference inclination is 62.1° (Table 1). For these reasons, we think that a 43.7° clockwise declination discordance from

Ammonia Tanks Tuff at site 94BH-33 (Table 1) from the southwest flank of Crater Flat (Fig. 9, queried) that also has a 17.6° inclination discordance may overestimate its true vertical-axis rotation component.
Despite these qualifications, the combined data set of new and old paleomagnetic results refine the distribution and timing of clockwise rotation within the Crater Flat domain. We come to the following conclusions about the clockwise rotation.
(1) Contours of 10° and 20° clockwise rotation can be extended north-northwest across the Crater Flat basin. These contours trend about 330° and provide the best estimate of the area and orientation of a zone of diffuse dextral shear that we infer is responsible for the clockwise rotations. This zone within the Crater Flat domain is part of a larger belt of clockwise rotation and the inferred dextral shear that extends at least 60 km farther to the north-northwest (Hudson and others, 1996).
(2) The variation of fault strikes from north to northeast as one moves south towards the southern part of Yucca Mountain and Crater Flat (Fig. 9) is well explained by clockwise rotation of these faults. On the north flank of northern Crater Flat, however, the amount of clockwise rotation is insufficient to fully explain the northeast strikes of faults there (Fig. 10).
(3) Rotation estimates for the Rainier Mesa Tuff mirror those from nearby sites in the Tiva Canyon Tuff throughout the Crater Flat basin, despite the common presence of an angular unconformity between these units (Fig. 3) (Carr, 1984; Scott, 1990). In contrast, sites from the Ammonia Tanks Tuff from the southern flank of Crater Flat are consistently less rotated than those of the older tuffs, as previously noted by Hudson and others (1994). These relations tightly constrain the onset of clockwise rotation in the basin between 11.6 Ma and 11.45 Ma.
(4) Flat-lying Rainier Mesa Tuff from two sites just north of the northeastern part of Bare Mountain are unrelated even though tilted Tiva Canyon Tuff from a site 1 km to the east appears to be rotated 25° clockwise (Fig. 10). These observations suggest that clockwise rotation occurred before 11.6 Ma in the northwest corner of the Crater Flat structural domain and that similar pre-11.6-Ma rotated fault blocks are buried under onlapping Rainier Mesa Tuff west of the domain boundary.
Paleostress Analysis
The fault-slip data measured in northern Crater Flat basin were grouped into 10 fault-slip domains in order to further delineate spatial and temporal changes of fault kinematics and to investigate paleostress patterns (Fig. 4). These data subdivisions were guided by the spatial distribution of measurement sites and by significant changes in mapped fault geometries, fault-slip characteristics, and (or) stratal tilt directions. Faultslip data from each domain were inverted to find best-fit reduced paleostress tensors consisting of the orientations and relative magnitudes of the principal stresses c1? c2, and cr3, where c^ c2> c3 (compressive stress positive). The relative stress magnitudes are
20

expressed by the ratio fy = (cj2- cr3)/( crj- cj3). The revised direct-inversion, or INVD, computational method of Angelier (1990) was used for determining the paleostress tensors. Details of specific analytical techniques employed in the present study and estimates of the associated analytical uncertainties were discussed by Minor (1995). Rough approximations of the error limits for stress tensor axis orientations and § values
computed by Minor (1995), which also apply to the present study, are ±15° and ±0.15, respectively. Although approximate fault offsets were determined for many of the measured faults (see Appendix A), no attempt was made in the present study to weight the fault-slip data on this basis inasmuch as previous studies (e.g., Angelier and others, 1985) have not obtained significant changes in stress tensor results by weighting based on fault size. Basic assumptions of fault-slip inversion methods and their implications have been previously addressed (e.g., Angelier, 1984; Zoback, 1989; Pollard and others, 1993).
Initially a single, overall best-fit tensor was computed for each domain. Domain data sets that did not yield reasonable single stress solutions were assumed to represent fault slip under the influence of evolving ambient stress states. To help decipher the paleostress history in such domains, the incompatible, polyphase data sets were subdivided into two or, in a few cases, three subsets as guided by: (1) cross-cutting and abutting relations of slickenside striae and fault planes, (2) contrasting fault-slip patterns revealed in data plots (see Appendix B), (3) the results of the initial data inversions, and (4) iterative statistical clustering analyses (Angelier, 1984; see Minor, 1995, for details of methodology used). Each data subset was then inverted to find the most compatible stress tensor. Relative-age information obtained for the fault-slip data were used to determine the most likely stress tensor sequence in each domain, which in turn guided paleostress correlations across the study area.
A total of 19 reasonable, reduced stress tensor solutions were obtained by inversion of fault-slip data from the 10 domains. Each domain yielded from one to three solutions depending on the size, complexity, and age range of the domainal data sets. Although as few as 7 measurements were used in computing stress tensors, most solutions were based on from about 15 to 25 measurements. About 16 % (53 measurements) of the total data set (321) was incompatible with the 19 stress solutions, and attempts to compute additional solutions with such data were unsuccessful. Such misfit data were assumed to reflect: (1) observational errors, (2) less-than-optimal data segregation prior to analysis, and (3) very localized stress perturbations due to secondary mechanical effects. These misfit data were not used in subsequent analyses. Details of the tensor results are presented in Table 2, and plots of the fault-slip data and stress tensor solutions and associated data subsets from each domain are located in Appendix D. All but one of the domains (domain 7) yield normal-slip stress solutions (maximum principal stress [crj subvertical) that are characterized by uniform northwest-oriented least principal stress (cr3) axes and § values generally ranging from about 0.3 to 0.6 (Fig. 11 and Table 2; see also no. 1 solutions in Appendix D). In Fig. 11 note that the
stress axis orientations have been back rotated as much as 20° counterclockwise to account for clockwise vertical-axis rotations that, by inference from the paleomagnetic determinations, affected measured faults after the early stress regime. (For rationale behind such rotation corrections see discussion below). Most of the faults compatible with these tensors are northeast-striking and exhibit normal dip slip (Fig. 12).

Computational statistics indicate that the solutions are good quality fits to the data. Based on consistent cross-cutting relations observed in the field and mapped fault relations these normal-slip stress tensors are inferred to represent an early stress-fault regime that is referred to as "event 1" (Figs. 11 and 12 and Table 2). Only in domain 8 in the eastern part of the study area is there evidence of an even earlier stress state ~ one that is marked by a distinct southwest-oriented cj3 axis (Fig. 11; see also "pre-1" event in Table 2). There, sinistral strike-slip striae on north-striking faults predate dextral obliqueslip striae on similarly oriented faults (see Appendix D, domain 8). Significantly, early northwest normal-slip stress directions were obtained in two of the three domains located within Timber Mountain (11.7-11.6-Ma) rocks (domains 6 and 10) even though northeast-striking normal faults are less numerous than the more northerly striking oblique-slip faults in those rocks (Fig. 8). In four of the early normal-slip stress solutions from domains in pre-Timber Mountain rocks the cij axes deviate slightly from vertical (as
much as 25° departure) in roughly the same direction as do the poles to tilted bedding observed in the domains (Appendix D), which suggest that associated normal-slip faults were tilted (i.e., rotated about horizontal axes) together with the adjacent strata. A second, younger, "event 2" stress tensor was computed in 7 of the domains (domains 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 9, and 10) (Fig. 13; event 2 solutions in Table 2 and Appendix D). Five of these 7 stress solutions have normal-slip configurations and are characterized by relatively low (<0.3) or high (>0.7) § values. Domain 8 also yielded a younger normalslip stress solution, but having a <|> value of 0.64, the stress tensor may have a closer affinity with the older, event 1 tensors (see Appendix D, domain 8, event "2?"). The younger stress tensor from domain 1 in the Tram Ridge area is the only stress solution computed in the study that has a strike-slip configuration (a2 vertical). Computational statistics indicate that all of these solutions are of reasonable quality despite their generally poorer fit to the data as compared to the older stress solutions (Table 2). In comparison to faults associated with the early set of stress tensors, fault-slip geometries compatible with the later tensors are more variable even within individual domains (Fig. 14 and Appendix D). The strike directions of compatible faults typically range from northeast to north (Fig. 14). Normal-oblique slip is the norm, with rake angles commonly
less than 70° and ranging as low as 0° (Appendix D). Lower-rake faults were also measured in domains 5 and 7, though in too small a number to compute compatible stress solutions (Appendix D). Throughout the study area northeast-striking oblique-slip faults, which commonly represent reactivated normal-slip faults from the earlier stress regime, display sinistral slip components, whereas north-striking faults have dextral slip components, regardless of fault dip direction (Fig. 14). A predominance of low-rake sinistral and lesser dextral strike-slip faults over oblique-slip faults accounts for the anomalous strike-slip stress a3 solution in the western Tram Ridge area (domain 1). The a3 axes associated with the younger stress solutions (Fig. 13) are oriented west-northwest in the western domains and are essentially parallel to the preceding restored (i.e., backrotated) normal-slip stress directions (Fig. 11). In the two easternmost domains (domains 9 and 10), however, the computed a3 axes are oriented west-southwest and are thus quite distinct from the older stress directions there. In contrast to the event 1 stress directions shown in Fig. 11, the younger event 2 stress axis orientations in Fig. 13 are not back rotated due to the inferred small, variable, indeterminate nature of vertical-axis rotations

of compatible faults as suggested by paleomagnetic results and fault-stratigraphic relations (see discussion below for details). Some of the stress configurations of the younger set include at axes that deviate somewhat from vertical in a manner like those of the older stress solutions, suggesting that locally faults continued to be tilted along with the strata during and (or) following fault movement.
A third distinct normal-slip stress tensor was determined from fault-slip data from each of the two westernmost domains in the Tram Ridge area (domains 1 and 2, Fig. 15). Relative age relations observed in these domains suggest that the stress tensors, which are characterized by southwest a3 directions, represent an even younger stress regime, here referred to as "event 3". Also, domain 7 in the central study area, entirely within the younger Timber Mountain rocks, yielded a single, south-southwest-oriented (a3) normalslip stress tensor that is probably temporally correlative to the youngest Tram Ridge tensors (Fig. 15). Faults associated with this youngest stress regime in all three domains consist mostly of northwest- to west-striking normal faults (Fig. 16). A few such faults were also measured in some of the other domains but in too small a number to compute meaningful stress solutions.
Paleostress and Fault-Kinematic History
Older fault/stress regimes - major extensional faulting influenced by caldera magmatism?
The older, event 1 stress/fault regime determined in this study along the northern margin of Crater Flat was active after emplacement of the 12.7-Ma Tiva Canyon Tuff, the youngest major ash-flow sheet of the Paintbrush magmatic episode (Sawyer and others, 1994). Clear fault-slip evidence of the occurrence of extensional faulting between eruption of the 13.4-Ma Tram Tuff, the oldest unit exposed in the study area, and the Tiva Canyon Tuff is lacking. A comparison of fault-slip data collected in 13.4-12.9-Ma Crater Flat and Calico Hills rocks with those collected in Paintbrush rocks (compare Figs. 6 and 7) does not reveal any major differences in fault-slip patterns even though there are a greater proportion of east-northeast-striking faults in the older rocks.
Evidence of an earlier distinct, localized, perhaps perturbed, stress state exists in domain 8 located immediately adjacent to the southwest margin of the Paintbrush-related Claim Canyon caldera (Fig. 11). The radial a3 direction of the stress tensor with respect to the caldera, and evidence of tilting of fault blocks in this domain away from the caldera, suggest that the stress state and related faults formed during caldera collapse or resurgence and reflect perturbed stresses localized around the caldera between about 12.7 and 12.5 Ma (Minor, 1995; Fridrich, in press). The timing of the subsequent, more widespread normal-slip stress/fault regime (with west-northwest a3 directions; Fig. 11) is partly constrained by the laterally persistent angular unconformity present at the base of Timber Mountain rocks in northern Crater Flat basin. Significantly greater southeast-to-south tilts in pre-Timber Mountain rocks in central and eastern parts of the study area indicate that much of the northeast-striking normal faulting and coeval stratal tilting that characterize the regime occurred prior to 11.7 Ma. The 1 m.y. period between 12.7 and 11.7 Ma has been identified as a

time of major extensional block faulting and subsidence in Crater Flat basin (Fridrich, in press; Fridrich and others, in press). Nonetheless the faulting regime must have persisted until sometime after 11.6 Ma as evidenced by the presence of older northeast-striking normal faults (see earlier discussion) and gentle southeast tilts in Rainier Mesa Tuff that yield similar west-northwest-oriented stress configurations (domains 6, 9, and 10, Fig. 11 and Appendix D). West-northwest c3 directions are maintained even after adjusting the stress axis orientations for younger (see discussion below) vertical-axis fault rotations (Fig. 12). Regional paleostress c3 orientations determined elsewhere in the southern Great Basin were typically southwest directed in the Miocene until about 9 Ma, at which time they gradually or rapidly rotated to a northwest orientation (Zoback and others, 1981; Minor, 1995). The difference between the early paleostress directions in the study area and other coeval directions in the region may have been due to (1) local stress perturbations due to the effects of caldera magmatism and development, and (or) (2) distinct Miocene stress trajectories and extension directions in the fundamentally strikeslip Walker Lane belt. The early c3 orientations are roughly tangential, or circumferential, with respect to the Claim Canyon caldera (Fig. 11). Circumferential c3 trajectories may have characterized a stress envelope that surrounded the Claim Canyon caldera during its central magmatic resurgence at about 12.5 Ma. Mapped northeaststriking faults that are compatible with the early northwest stress orientations appear to be radial about the caldera, and throw along these faults commonly diminishes towards the caldera margin (Fridrich and others, 1994), corroborating possible caldera stress influence. There is weak indication of a small clockwise shift in the computed c3
orientations (about 25° change in azimuth) to the east toward the caldera (Fig. 11), which is consistent with increased perturbation of far-field stresses towards the caldera similar to inferred coeval paleostress perturbations northeast of the caldera in the Yucca Flat region (Minor, 1995). North-northwest <73 trajectories persisted for some period of time following the 11.6-Ma initial collapse of the Timber Mountain caldera complex just to the north (see discussion below), so it is plausible that circumferential stresses associated with Timber Mountain magmatism also influenced the stress field (Fig. 11). Cummings (1968) similarly suggested that circumferential c3 trajectories related to the Timber Mountain caldera complex perturbed far-field stresses particularly near the north and south margins of the complex, though his finding was based on a two-dimensional theoretical model.
The possibility that the anomalous Miocene early stress directions in northern Crater Flat are also associated with the Walker Lane belt is discussed below in the context of the younger fault/stress regimes.
Younger fault/stress regimes - oblique slip and inclined-axis fault block rotations
The subsequent normal stress regime was characterized by a markedly different style of fault kinematics even though associated c3 axes in the western domains were nearly parallel to earlier stress orientations there (compare Figs. 11 and 13). The change from predominantly normal-slip faulting to mainly oblique-slip faulting that marked the new regime (compare Figs. 12 and 14) is consistent with initiation of fault block rotations about vertical axes at that time (Scotti and Nur, 1990). Some of the stress tensors
31

compatible with the oblique-slip faults have relatively low § values which indicate that the orientations of the two horizontal stress axes (i.e., o2 and G3) are not well constrained (Table 2 and Appendix D). Such poorly defined stress orientations could be due to varying amounts of vertical-axis rotation of faults during slip such that the faults collectively do not tightly define the horizontal stress-axis orientations. A few other stress tensors are characterized by high § values (i.e., G} and o2 magnitudes similar) or, in one case, a vertical c2 axis, suggesting that local stress states approached or obtained a strike-slip configuration. This is corroborated by an overall decrease in rake angles on faults compatible with these tensors (Fig. 14). The earlier-mentioned evidence that stratal tilting continued during the oblique-slip faulting suggests that vertical-axis rotations accompanied tilting or, viewed another way, that rotations occurred about inclined axes (eg., Scotti andNur, 1990).
The paleomagnetic data suggests that as much as 25° of clockwise vertical-axis rotation occurred in the study area following emplacement of the Rainier Mesa Tuff at 11.6 Ma, although negligible rotations detected in this tuffjust west of Tram Ridge imply that any vertical-axis rotation in the westernmost domain(s) happened somewhat earlier (Fig. 10). Paleomagnetic data from the southern part of the basin indicates instead a consistent westward younging of clockwise vertical-axis rotation, with significant rotation occurring after 11.6 Ma but before emplacement of the 11.45-Ma Ammonia Tanks (Fig. 9). Collectively these paleomagnetic constraints suggest that in northern Crater Flat basin oblique-slip faulting, which presumably accommodated the vertical- (or inclined-) axis rotations, peaked around 11.6 Ma, although this episode was somewhat diachronous and not uniformly westward younging. The best-fit o3 directions obtained by inversions of the oblique-slip fault data are probably slightly (<10°) clockwise of their actual paleo-orientations as a consequence of synkinematic clockwise inclined-axis rotations of some of the faults. Nevertheless, there is no accurate way to correct for (i.e., back rotate) such rotations because the faults were likely rotated to different degrees ranging anywhere from 0° to -25° (see also Scott, 1990, p. 265). Stress directions shown in Fig. 13 are not changed appreciably relative to the earlier stress directions in rotated areas (Fig. 11) even if the younger directions are back rotated 10° counterclockwise. Normal-slip faults compatible with the preceeding stress regime presumably predate the vertical-axis rotations such that they were fully rotated with the surrounding rocks during the oblique-slip faulting.
Continued caldera-magmatic influence?
Stress trajectories apparently did not change significantly in northwestern Crater Flat basin despite the marked changes in faulting style and, perhaps, relative stress magnitudes (i.e., § values) that characterized the younger oblique-slip stress/fault regime. Similar to the early normal-slip stress regime, the stress trajectories and configurations of the oblique-slip regime may partly reflect a stress envelope that surrounded the Timber Mountain caldera complex around the time of its initial collapse at 11.6 Ma; conceivably by this time any localized stresses related to the 12.7 Ma Claim Canyon caldera had a diminished effect on the ambient stress field. The five western o3 directions are roughly circumferential with respect to the southern margin of this caldera, whereas the directions
32

of the two easternmost domains are distinctly west-southwest (Fig. 13). The latter two stress orientations may represent, together with the three inferred youngest southwest a3 directions (Fig. 15), greater influence of regional, far-field stresses as caldera magnetism waned. Alternatively, the southwest stress directions and associated faulting could reflect radial cj3 trajectories resulting from collapse of the caldera complex due to eruption of the Rainier Mesa Tuff at 11.6 Ma and (or) Ammonia Tanks Tuff at 11.45 Ma (cf. Minor, 1995). Joint-orientation and fault-slip data from northern Yucca Mountain (~15 km southeast of the easternmost domain; see Fig. 17) indicate that the local normal-slip(?) stress field there rotated about 30° counterclockwise from a west cj3 orientation to a westsouthwest orientation sometime after 12.7 Ma (Throckmorton and Verbeek, 1995; E.R. Verbeek, written commun., 1995). It is possible that this stress change was due to the same mechanism that caused the southwest directional shift of cj3 axes in northern Crater Flat. However, the Yucca Mountain site is roughly twice as distant from the margin of the Timber Mountain caldera complex, so any caldera stress influence there would likely be smaller (Fig. 17).
Broadly distributed dextral shear and oblique extension
Caldera-magmatic stress influences do not readily explain the change to dominantly normal-oblique-slip faulting, inclined-axis rotations, and local quasi-strikeslip stress configurations at about 11.6 Ma across much of the Crater Flat basin. The most likely cause for such changes was a pulse or significant increase of broadly distributed dextral shear across the southern Walker Lane belt (Fig. 1), resulting in oblique extension, or transtension, in the Crater Flat basin. Under favorable mechanical and stress conditions broad, regional, deep-seated zones of dextral (or sinistral) shear can be accommodated in the brittle upper crust by distributed block faulting without requiring the development of discrete, through-going strike-slip faults (McKenzie and Jackson, 1983). Typical surface expressions of this style of deformation, as documented in numerous recent field studies in the region, include vertical- or inclined-axis rotations, domains of subparallel oblique-slip "domino" faults with strike slip components opposite that of the overall shear sense, numerous sets of cross-cutting slickenside striae, and broad oroclinal flexures (e.g., Rosenbaum and others, 1991; Hudson and others, in press). Such features characterize the younger fault deformation in the northern part of the basin. The geometry and kinematics of this faulting are also consistent with the oblique rift model of Withjack and Jamison (1986). That this part of the basin was subjected to a regional north-northwest-trending dextral shear couple is indicated by: (1) clockwiserotated fault blocks, (2) sinistral slip components distributed on subparallel northeaststriking faults, (3) localized north-trending zones of dextral oblique slip, (4) fanning strike geometry of fault blocks, and (5) the northwest-trending rotational strain gradient recognized across the entire Crater Flat basin (Figs. 2, 3, 9, 10, and 14; Appendix D) (Withjack and Jamison, 1986; Rosenbaum and others, 1991; Fridrich, in press). Geologic evidence presented by Fridrich (in press) indicates that a majority of the extension occurring in Crater Flat basin took place between 12.7 and 11.6 Ma during the older widespread stress/fault regime detected in this study. The fault-slip and paleomagnetic data presented here provide evidence that significant dextral-oblique extension of the

Figure 17. Regional geologic map (same as Fig. 1) showing regional Miocene (pre9-Ma?) paleostress (a3) orientations determined in this and other studies. Timing constraints for some of the plotted paleostress determinations are poor, and their Miocene age assignment is speculative. Note how G3 axes change abruptly across Walker Lane belt boundary from southwest to northwest orientations. Paleostress orientations are keyed numerically to the following sources: (1) Wright (1977); (2) Scott and Hofland (1987); (3) Anderson and Ekren (1977) and Zoback and others (1981); (4) Frizzell and Zoback (1987); (5) Wernicke and others (1988); (6) Throckmorton and Verbeek (1995); (7) Minor (1995); (8) this study; (9) Hudson (1997); (10) S.A.

basin lagged this major early phase of faulting by as much as 1 m.y. (Fig. 18). Accordingly, Crater Flat basin might best be viewed as a slightly oblique extensional graben that had an increased component of dextral shear imposed on it after much of the basin had formed. Structural evidence indicates that oblique extension accompanied by oblique-slip faulting and, presumably, clockwise rotations has continued within the basin up to the present, although at a greatly reduced rate relative to the Miocene (e.g., O'Neill and others, 1991; Fridrich and others, in press).
Miocene regional paleostress trajectories
In contrast to the present study that indicates a prevailing west-northwest a3 direction in the northwestern part of the basin throughout most, if not all, of the basin's history, previous paleostress studies in the northern Yucca Mountain area inferred a west to west-southwest post-12.7 Ma a3 direction (Fig. 17) (Scott and Holland, 1987; Throckmorton and Verbeek, 1995; E.R. Verbeek, written commun., 1995). Studies further east in the Yucca Flat area and in surrounding areas of the Basin and Range province indicate that the Miocene regional a3 direction was west-southwest directed until about 9 Ma (Fig. 17) (Anderson and Ekren, 1977; Zoback and others, 1981; Minor, 1995). In contrast, fault-slip data northwest (S.A. Minor, unpub. data) and southeast (Frizzell and Zoback, 1987; Hudson, 1997) of northern Crater Flat, although preliminary or poorly constrained temporally, are consistent with a west-northwest Miocene (-14-9 Ma ?) a3 direction (Fig. 17). Wernicke and others (1988) determined, based mainly on structural constraints, that since about 15 Ma the average extension direction along the southeasternmost Walker Lane belt (between the Spring Mountains and the Death Valley region) was west-northwest (-295°) (Fig. 17). Similarly, Wright (1977) argued that structural geologic relations in southern Death Valley are compatible with a west-northwest a3 direction there during the Miocene. Together these studies suggest that pre-9-Ma Miocene <J3 trajectories curved from more typical west-southwest Miocene Basin and Range orientations east of Yucca Mountain through roughly west directions at Yucca Mountain to west-northwest orientations west of Yucca Mountain (Figs. 17 and 18). Such a stress pattern is consistent with the view that the Yucca Mountain/Crater Flat area spans a northwest-trending transition zone between the kinematically distinct Basin and Range and Walker Lane tectonic provinces (Fridrich, in press). The caldera complexes and underlying magma reservoirs north of Yucca Mountain likely had some mechanical influence on the positioning, dynamics, and kinematics of this transition zone. Thus, the curving pre-9-Ma stress trajectories spanning Crater Flat basin are best viewed as a composite effect of caldera magmatism, Basin and Range extension, and Walker Lane dextral shear.
An areally extensive fault-slip inversion study conducted in the Walker Lane by Bellier and Zoback (1995) indicates that in Plio-Quaternary time a3 directions in the belt have remained approximately west-northwest even though they infer that the overall stress configuration has recently changed from normal to strike slip. Thus, the southern part of the fundamentally strike-slip Walker Lane belt likely had a stress history independent from that of the Basin and Range province that was characterized by an irrotational stress field (i.e., constant west-northwest a3 direction) throughout the

Neogene and Quaternary. One implication is that the younger northern Crater Flat stress tensors with southwest a3 directions likely represent late caldera-induced stress perturbations rather than far-field tectonic stress. Another implication is that the change in fault kinematics at about 11.6 Ma in Crater Flat basin was probably not due to a change in orientation of regional principal stress axes, although changes in the relative magnitudes of the regional principal stress axes (i.e., changes in § value) are not precluded (e.g., Scotti andNur, 1990).
Evidence for late fault reactivation
There is evidence in northern Crater Flat basin that some of the northeast-striking faults were reactivated with dip-slip normal movement sometime after significant oblique-slip faulting and, presumably, inclined-axis block rotations had occurred. A few observations were made along such faults of dip-slip slickenside striae that overprint lowor moderate-rake striae. Given the present state of stress in the Yucca Mountain area (c^ vertical, 295° cr3 azimuth, Stock and others, 1985) and evidence for recent normal faulting in the area along trends perpendicular to this azimuth (Fig. 3; Simonds and others, 1995), it is conceivable that some of this late fault movement occurred as late as the Quaternary.
Conclusions
Fault-slip measurements were made in northern Crater Flat basin and paleomagnetic data were acquired from throughout the basin to provide fault kinematic and timing contraints and to determine paleostress conditions bearing on the Neogene tectonic evolution of the Crater Flat structural domain. The following conclusions are drawn from this study: 4 Three principal Miocene faulting episodes are recognized in the northern part of the
basin (timing indicated in parentheses): (1) formation of closely spaced, normal-slip, northeast-striking faults accompanied by mostly southeastward stratal tilting, contributing to major extensional development of Crater Flat basin (12.7-11.6 Ma); (2) sinistral-normal oblique-slip reactivation of northeast-striking faults and concurrent formation of cross-cutting, dextral-normal oblique-slip, north-striking, down-to-the-west faults accompanied by clockwise, inclined-axis fault-block rotations of as much as 25° (11.7 11.45 Ma); (3) normal and oblique slip along mostly newer northwest-striking faults (~11.45 Ma?).
4 Paleostress analysis of the fault-slip data indicate that during most of the Miocene fault deformation a normal-fault stress field (i.e., al vertical) marked by fixed, westnorthwest oriented a3 stress trajectories prevailed in the northern part of the basin. Only the relative magnitudes of the principal stresses (i.e., (|) values) changed during the oblique-slip fault episode, which partly reflected local domains of increased strike-slip faulting. The a3 trajectories locally and intermittently shifted into radial, circumferential, or intermediate orientations with respect to the adjacent Claim Canyon and Timber Mountain caldera complexes, most likely due to the transient effects of stress envelopes surrounding the calderas during their development.
37

+ Paleomagnetic data generally indicate southwest-increasing and -younging clockwise vertical-axis rotations of fault blocks across the Crater Flat basin domain beginning between about 11.6 and 11.45 Ma. These rotations define a north-northwest-trending rotational strain gradient that spans the length of the basin and that presumably defines the trend of a causative dextral shear couple.
+ Pronounced dextral oblique extension of the Crater Flat domain commenced after as much as 1 m.y. of major extension of the basin had already occurred. This superposition of strong dextral shear across the extensional basin was probably related to an abrupt increase in dextral shear strain along the southeastern Walker Lane belt.
+ Paleostress and structural analyses from the present study and from other studies in the region suggest that pre-9-Ma regional G3 trajectories curved sharply from westsouthwest orientations to west-northwest orientations along the transition zone between the Basin and Range and Walker Lane tectonic provinces. The Miocene calderas along the north boundary of the Crater Flat structural domain may have acted as a stress guide that confined the margin of the Walker Lane belt in the Miocene and influenced the curving of stress trajectories across the Crater Flat domain.

Appendix A

Fault-Slip Data

The composite list of northern Crater Flat fault-slip data presented in this section was generated using the data entry program MEASURE created by Angelier (1984). This program puts the data in a format that can be read by Angelier's (1984, 1990) fault-slip inversion programs for determining best-fit stress tensors. The data are listed in stratigraphic order based on the youngest faulted stratigraphic rock unit within each measurement site. Data from sites in the stratigraphically youngest rock unit in the study area (Tmr) are listed first, followed by data from progressively older units. Each site is designated by three letters, the first two of which correspond to the second and third letters of the youngest rock unit's map symbol as shown on the geologic maps of Fridrich and others (1994, in prep.). The third letter of each site designation, which increases alphabetically with recency of establishment, serves to distinguish individual sites having the same first two letter designations. For example, in both site "MRA" and site "MRB" rock unit Tmr is the youngest faulted stratigraphic unit, but faults in site MRA were measured before those in site MRB. Details of the data format are illustrated in Fig. Al using as an example a representative interval of data excerpted from the composite data listing. The data index and slip-sense codes used in the listing are defined in Table Al.

bedding measurement

Numbers corresponding to relative slip ages increase with youthfulness, with 1 representing the oldest measured slip event. The relative age determinations are rated in terms of their relative degree of certainty, with a rating of 1 corresponding to the highest certainty. Multiple slip measurements taken on the same fault plane are assigned the same measurement number for ease of identification in the data listing. Each of these measurements are treated as independant datums, however, for the purposes of fault-slip analysis.

Site Data Plots Fault-slip data from each of the measurement sites are plotted on the following pages as lower-hemisphere, equal-area stereographic projections. Each plot shows measured fault planes (solid great circles) and associated slickenside striae (solid dots) and slip-sense determinations (full-headed arrows indicate hanging-wall movement of dip-slip faults; half-headed arrows show relative movement of strike-slip faults; complete, partial, and missing arrow heads denote certain, probable, and inferred slip sense determinations, respectively). Bedding attitudes measured at each site are shown by dashed great circles. Total number of fault-slip measurements at each site is indicated at lower right of each plot.

Fault-Slip Measurement Locations The locations of the individual fault-slip measurements are shown on the following copies of portions of the l:12,000-scale EAST OF BEATTY MOUNTAIN NW, NE, SW, and SE and BEATTY MOUNTAIN NE and SE topographic maps. These base maps were produced for the U.S. Department of Energy's Yucca Mountain Project. All locations belonging to a particular measurement site are enclosed by an irregular circle and the corresponding three-letter site designation is indicated.

Fault-Slip Data and Paleostress Tensor Plots Plotted below are lower-hemisphere equal-area stereographic projections of fault-slip data and paleostress tensor solutions from each of the 10 fault-slip domains designated in the study area. The larger, uppermost plot in each case represents all fault-slip data measured in the indicated domain. Below are one or more pairs of smaller plots of computed principal stress axes (right side) and associated fault-slip data (left side). Features of the fault-slip data plots are explained in Appendix B. In the stress plots, the 5-, 4-, and 3pointed symbols represent the a^ a2, and a3 axes, respectively, with the relative size of the symbols proportional to the computed (j) value; the (j) values are shown at lower right; large bold arrows highlight azimuths of subhorizontal 03 (diverging arrows) and a^ (converging arrows) axes. Numbers above solution pairs indicate inferred relative ages of fault/stress regimes in the domain, with 1 the oldest (queried where unknown or uncertain) (also see Table 2).
