abstract
Study region: The Little River Experimental Watershed (LREW) in the Southern Coastal Plain Major Land Resource Area of the U.S.A. (N31◦28 54 , W83◦35 03 ). Study focus: Separation of streamﬂow hydrographs into rapid stormﬂow and baseﬂow can vastly improve our understanding of watershed processes. The two parameter Eckhardt digital ﬁlter method for separation of high and low frequency signals was used to estimate the portion of streamﬂow emanating from soil water and groundwater. The method requires estimation of two ﬁtting parameters, BFImax and alpha (␣). The baseﬂow index (BFI) is the ratio of baseﬂow volume to total streamﬂow volume. BFImax was set at 0.80 and ␣ at 0.98. New hydrological insights for the region: Baseﬂow was found to produce 53% of annual streamﬂow. Stormﬂow was found to produce 47% of the annual streamﬂow. Baseﬂow was the greatest during the months from December through May (55–57%) and the least during the months from June through November (43–46%). Annual BFI was found to decrease with increasing annual precipitation, indicating that during high precipitation year’s saturation excess driven stormﬂow increases in the LREW. Hydrograph analysis indicated an average stormﬂow duration of seven days, typically extended by interﬂow in this watershed. These observed seasonal patterns can have a signiﬁcant impact on regional agriculture as well as coastal estuaries that both rely heavily upon streamﬂow.

1. Introduction
An understanding of streamﬂow processes is important for a number of purposes including water resource management, aquatic ecosystem preservation, hydropower generation, contaminant transport, and low-ﬂow forecasting (Beck et al., 2013). Streamﬂow is composed of three parts: overland ﬂow or surface runoff created by water that does not inﬁltrate into the soil

and travels quickly to the stream, interﬂow consisting of water that inﬁltrates into the soil and travels laterally downslope through upper soil layers, and groundwater ﬂow that inﬁltrates and travels through the aquifer. Separation of streamﬂow into these components is subjective since there is no method for precisely identifying each. Water that follows pathways through the subsurface reaches the stream slower, leading to delayed signatures in streamﬂow hydrographs. Subsurface ﬂow can consist of both shallow interﬂow and deeper aquifer ﬂow. Interﬂow can be driven by restrictive soil horizons that occur within many soils. Interﬂow moves more slowly than surface runoff but typically more rapidly than groundwater. Hydrograph separation is further complicated because interﬂow can reemerge downgradient as seepage at the land surface and combine with direct surface runoff. In terms of the streamﬂow hydrograph, it can be impossible to distinguish between the three different components. Because of this, streamﬂow is typically divided into two components for hydrograph separation, stormﬂow and baseﬂow. Stormﬂow contains true surface runoff and the quickﬂow portion of interﬂow while baseﬂow contains groundwater ﬂow and the portion of interﬂow moving slowly through the subsoil.
Baseﬂow is particularly important throughout the Southern Coastal Plain (SCP) Major Land Resource Area (USDA-NRCS, 2006). A favorable climate, fertile soils, and ample rainfall make the SCP a productive agricultural region. The SCP is rich in surface and subsurface water resources that are essential for agriculture. Many of the region’s surﬁcial aquifers contribute to baseﬂow throughout the SCP (Miller, 1990). Transmissivity of the surﬁcial aquifer throughout the SCP is highly variable (Miller, 1990; Santhi et al., 2008), as a result baseﬂow contributions to streamﬂow can be highly variable. Increasing demands on groundwater, changes in land-use, and changes in precipitation patterns due to climate change all are expected to impact baseﬂow conditions and streamﬂow volume. Furthermore, comprehensive planning for water resource management, development, and use can beneﬁt from a clear understanding of seasonal baseﬂow patterns as well as long-term changes in baseﬂow behavior (Esralew and Lewis, 2010).
Separation of streamﬂow hydrographs into rapid stormﬂow and baseﬂow can vastly improve our understanding of streamﬂow and chemical transport. Because surface runoff moves rapidly into the stream while baseﬂow moves more slowly through the soil, separating and understanding these two processes is fundamental to understanding the hydrologic and water quality effects of many watershed processes. In many landscapes surface runoff can be intercepted by topographic depressions that can store water preventing transport to the stream and enhancing inﬁltration. Despite these complications, characterizing these two components of streamﬂow can greatly improve watershed hydrologic budgets. For validation of hydrology in model simulations, stormﬂow and baseﬂow components of streamﬂow hydrographs typically need to be separated. Incorrect representation of baseﬂow patterns can lead to erroneous model results and ultimately erroneous policy decisions (Arnold et al., 2014). For validation of hydrology in Conservation Effects Assessment Project (CEAP) model simulations, stormﬂow and baseﬂow components of streamﬂow hydrographs were separated for hundreds of gages across the U.S. (Santhi et al., 2008). CEAP model output was then calibrated for stormﬂow and baseﬂow, illustrating the importance of hydrograph separation.
Baseﬂow is typically estimated through analysis of streamﬂow time-series hydrographs, separating streamﬂow into the stormﬂow and baseﬂow. Various techniques exist for hydrograph separation. Because it is not physically possible to completely differentiate stormﬂow from baseﬂow, methods for hydrograph separation vary widely. Techniques typically fall into manual graphical, automated ﬁltering, and tracer based methods. The most widely used graphical separation technique, referred to as the straight line method, consists of graphically extending the recession component of the hydrograph before a storm that is solely composed of baseﬂow, to a point of the recession after the peak of the hydrograph (Fig. 1). For this method a straight line is drawn from the start of the rising limb of the hydrograph to a selected point on the recession hydrograph, assuming that stormﬂow is the component above the line and baseﬂow is the component below the line. Selection of the

112 D.D. Bosch et al. / Journal of Hydrology: Regional Studies 10 (2017) 110–121
beginning point can be easily identiﬁed based upon the beginning of the hydrograph response to stormﬂow. Selection of the ﬁnal point is often much more arbitrary (Linsley et al., 1975). The straight line method is typically isolated to a single peak hydrograph resulting from a single storm event. Complex (multiple-peak) events are difﬁcult to interpret with respect to onset and ending time of baseﬂow.
Graphical hydrograph separation techniques work well for isolated events. However, most streamﬂow records include numerous events over any given period. Graphical analysis for extended records can be impractical. Because of this, automated methods have been developed for hydrograph separation. For continuous hydrographs, automated techniques are typically used that process the entire time-series data and derive baseﬂow. These methods are typically referred to as digital ﬁltering procedures that use numeric algorithms to separate the ﬂow. In general, ﬁltering methods do not have hydrological basis but aim to generate an objective, repeatable, and easily automated method to derive baseﬂow response of a catchment. Digital ﬁltering methods remove inconsistencies inherent in graphical methods and reduce the time required for hydrograph separation. Many ﬁltering methods exist, only a few of which will be discussed here. An excellent review of ﬁltering methods is presented by Brodie and Hostetler (2005). One widely used baseﬂow separation application is the U.S. Geological Survey HYSEP program (Sloto and Crouse, 1996). HYSEP is a public domain computer program with three separation methods: ﬁxed interval, sliding interval, and local minimum. Additional numeric techniques include the single parameter (Nathan and McMahan, 1990) and the two parameter (Eckhardt, 2005) digital ﬁlters. The two parameter digital ﬁlter has been shown to provide comparable results to the widely used HYSEP method (Lim et al., 2005). Gonzales et al. (2009) also compared several methods for estimating baseﬂow and reported that the Eckhardt two parameter digital ﬁlter method yielded baseﬂow index (BFI) estimates comparable to those obtained using tracer tests. The BFI is the ratio of baseﬂow volume to total ﬂow volume, often expressed as a percentage, determined after the hydrograph separation has been completed. Tracer methods make direct measurements of the stormﬂow and baseﬂow components. However, even with tracer techniques considerable uncertainty exists with hydrograph separation (Gonzales et al., 2009; Rumsey et al., 2015).
The BFI varies depending upon geology, topography, and season. Within any given watershed, it can vary as the vadose zone within the watershed changes in water content. The analysis of Wolock (2003) for the conterminous United States indicated BFI ranges from 0.20 to 0.60 for the Georgia section of the SCP. Santhi et al. (2008) estimated baseﬂow for the conterminous United States using the single parameter digital ﬁlter method during low ET (non-summer) months and found index values from 0.30-0.50 for the Georgia SCP. Shrimohammadi et al. (1984) examined hydrographs using the straight line method for the Little River Experimental Watershed (LREW) in South Georgia, USA for the period from 1968 to 1981 for rainfall events exceeding 5 mm. The determination of the ﬁnal point on the recession hydrograph was made based upon the anticipated stormﬂow runoff duration from any event, a function of watershed area. They reported BFIs ranging from 0.58 to 0.81 for watersheds ranging in scale from 2.6 to 334 km2, with an estimate of 0.68 for primary Little River drainage. They further reported a BFI of 0.79 for a 1494 km2 portion of the Little River (1968–1970).
As expressed, baseﬂow is expected to vary seasonally, a function of varying levels of evapotranspiration and aquifer storage. Streamﬂow during the months of December through April in watersheds throughout the SCP is typically much greater than during the months of May through November (Sheridan, 1997). Greater precipitation and smaller evapotranspiration rates during the winter and spring months create greater soil-moisture and greater aquifer recharge, increasing surface runoff responses and groundwater contributions to streamﬂow. Sheridan (1997) reported that 54% of the precipitation received in January through April becomes streamﬂow while only 12% becomes streamﬂow throughout the remainder of the year. Shirmohammadi et al. (1986) reported that alluvial storage surrounding regional streams in the Southeastern U.S. varies from 0 to 20% available during late winter and spring to 100% available during late summer and fall. The lack of available storage in the winter and spring subsequently leads to high peak ﬂows and high streamﬂow (Shirmohammadi et al., 1986). For regions with surﬁcial aquifers, baseﬂow can cease during summer and fall periods when the surﬁcial aquifer tends to be dry. Streamﬂow during summer and fall may be dominated by surface runoff generated during high intensity precipitation events.
The SCP region consists mainly of low-elevation ﬂat to rolling terrain with numerous streams, abundant rainfall, a complex coastline, and many wetlands. Streams throughout the ecoregion are relatively low gradient and sandy bottom. The region contains many areas with shallow aquifer systems that feed streamﬂow. The Little River Experimental Watershed (LREW) was established as a long-term study site in the SCP by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, Agricultural Research Service in 1968. The Little River is considered to be generally representative of the climate, topography, soils, geology, stream networks, and agricultural production systems within the Level III Southeastern Plains ecoregion. Additionally, the contribution of surface water to deep seepage is believed to be relatively small, simplifying deﬁning experimental watershed water budgets. The LREW is in the headwaters of the Suwannee River Basin. An extensive body of hydrologic data exists for the LREW (Bosch et al., 2007a).
While some studies have examined baseﬂow in the LREW (Shrimohammadi et al., 1984; Shirmohammadi et al., 1986; Nejadhashemi et al., 2009), these studies focused on a small sub-watershed of the LREW and short periods of record. A consistent examination of baseﬂow on the larger LREW, an extensive analysis of the complete database, and analysis of seasonal trends in the baseﬂow is lacking. The objectives of this research were to: 1) Quantify annual baseﬂow conditions in the Georgia LREW and 2) Quantify seasonal characteristics of baseﬂow in the Georgia LREW.

2. Materials and methods

2.1. Site and instrumentation

The LREW, located near Tifton, Georgia, in the SCP of the U.S.A. (N31◦28 54 , W83◦35 03 ) was selected for the study
(Fig. 2). The LREW is part of the Gulf Atlantic Coastal Plain LTAR (Maddox, 2013). The hydrology and water quality of the
LREW has been monitored by the Southeast Watershed Research Laboratory (SEWRL) since 1967 (Bosch et al., 2007a). The climate is humid subtropical with a long growing season. Annual precipitation averages 1200 mm yr−1. Mean annual temperature is around 18.7 ◦C, with the coldest month of the year being January with an average temperature of 10.6 ◦C and the warmest being July with an average temperature of 26.8 ◦C.
The 334 km2 LREW is a mixed land-use watershed that contains row crop agriculture, pasture and forage, upland forest,
and riparian forest. The agricultural ﬁelds are typically less than 40 ha in size and nested among forested drainages (Bosch

et al., 2004). The surface soil textures are generally sands and sandy loams with high inﬁltration rates. Many of the upland soils of the LREW contain argillic horizons that include an accumulation of silicate clays that restrict vertical inﬁltration of water and cause shallow lateral subsurface interﬂow. The LREW landscape is dominated by a dense dendritic network of stream channels bordered by riparian forest wetlands (Asmussen et al., 1979) with drainage densities varying from 1.6 to 2.0 km km−2 (Sheridan, 1994). The drainage density is less than the drainage densities reported for Coastal Plain watersheds in South Carolina (Ssegane et al., 2013) but similar to those reported for Maryland (Carlston, 1963). Precipitation patterns during the summer show less average depth, shorter duration, higher intensity, and more frequent occurrence than events during other seasons of the year (Bosch et al., 1999).
Research within the LREW indicates that direct surface runoff can vary between 5 and 40% of annual precipitation while shallow subsurface interﬂow ﬂow vary between 2 and 35% of annual precipitation (Asmussen and Ritchie, 1969; Hubbard and Sheridan, 1983; Bosch et al., 2012). Further research indicates that within the Coastal Plain landscape, saturation within the ﬂoodplain can lead to surface seepage by the shallow subsurface interﬂow in lower landscape positions (Bosch et al., 1996; Inamdar et al., 1999). Surface soils are underlain by the upper part of the shallow and relatively impermeable Hawthorne formation that restricts downward movement of inﬁltrated precipitation and leads to groundwater ﬂow to the stream channels (Sheridan, 1997). Within the LREW, this formation can vary from 5 m below the land surface to within a meter of land surface in the ﬂoodplain (Shirmohammadi et al., 1986; Bosch et al., 1996). Baseﬂow within this landscape is driven by ﬂow within the surﬁcial aquifer above the Hawthorne formation in combination with the portion of the shallow interﬂow that remains below the ground surface. Within the LREW, baseﬂow consists of the slower contributions to the streamﬂow while the stormﬂow represents more rapid contributions (direct surface runoff and in some cases the seepage component of the shallow subsurface ﬂow).
Historical watershed weighted precipitation and streamﬂow data were obtained from the SEWRL database (Bosch and Sheridan, 2007; Bosch et al., 2007b). The watershed weighted precipitation is determined using the inverse distance, or the reciprocal distance weighting technique (Smith, 1992; Dean and Snyder, 1977). The period of record examined was from 1972 to 2015. This analysis was limited to examination of data from the largest watershed, Watershed B (Fig. 2), a 334 km2 drainage area. Daily watershed weighted precipitation and streamﬂow data extrapolated from the subdaily data were examined. All periods of observed streamﬂow were used.
2.2. Data analysis
The automated web based hydrograph analysis tool, WHAT, that utilizes numerical techniques to separate rapid direct runoff from baseﬂow was selected for data processing (Lim et al., 2005). WHAT allows selection of any of three methods: the local minimum method (Sloto and Crouse, 1996), the one parameter BFLOW digital ﬁlter (Lyne and Hollick, 1979; Nathan and McMahan, 1990; Arnold and Allen, 1999; Arnold et al., 2000), and the two parameter or Eckhardt digital ﬁlter (Eckhardt, 2005). The digital ﬁlter method does not consider pre-existing hydrological or climatic conditions of the watershed since its origin comes from the algorithm used in digital ﬁlters used for signal processing. Parameters of the algorithms need to be determined based on ﬂow characteristics, seasonal variations, and storm events.
The two parameter Eckhardt digital ﬁlter method used for separation of high and low frequency signals was used here (Lim et al., 2005). Compared to other ﬁltering methods the two parameter Eckhardt method tends to reduce high BFI estimates and increase low BFI estimates (Ekhardt, 2008). The local minimum method has been shown to consistently overestimate baseﬂow (Lim et al., 2005). The one parameter digital ﬁlter method has been shown to yield good results when compared to manual methods (r2 value of 0.83 when compared to observed data, Arnold and Allen, 1999). Lim et al. (2005) found a strong correlation between the single parameter and two parameter digital ﬁlter methods (Lim et al., 2005). However, the two parameter Eckhardt digital ﬁlter method has the advantage of incorporating a reduction in streamﬂow and baseﬂow when direct runoff has ceased. The Eckhardt method requires estimation of two ﬁtting parameters, BFImax and a ﬁlter parameter (␣). BFI can be calculated from the estimates of baseﬂow and streamﬂow produced by the digital ﬁlter. While ␣ can be determined based upon analysis of individual hydrograph recession curves, selection of BFImax is not measurable (Eckhardt, 2005). Error analysis performed by Eckhardt (2012) indicated that ␣ inﬂuences the calculated baseﬂow more than does BFImax. Based upon published recommendations for perennial streams with porous aquifers (Eckhardt, 2005), a ﬁxed BFImax value of 0.80 was selected for the LREW. As described by Ekhardt (2008), ␣ was determined by plotting recession curves for multiple hydrographs over several years. The recession curves were obtained by plotting streamﬂow at day i versus streamﬂow at day i + 1. The parameter ␣ is the slope of the line that forms the upper bound between the two ﬂows (Ekhardt, 2008). Following this procedure, an ␣ value of 0.98 was selected. These BFImax and ␣ values have been used by several other researchers for similar watersheds and have yielded good results (Lim et al., 2010; Zhang et al., 2013; Zomlot et al., 2015). Examination of the multiple hydrographs over several years and seasons for the LREW watershed using these parameters indicated a good ﬁt to observed hydrographs and recession curves.
Data were partitioned into annual (January–December) and seasonal periods for hydrograph analysis. The seasonal selection was based upon observed climatic and hydrologic patterns and has been used in explaining the response of hydrologic, sediment, and water quality parameters to precipitation on Coastal Plain watersheds (Asmussen et al., 1975; Sheridan et al., 1982; Hubbard and Sheridan, 1983; Bosch et al., 1999). The four selected seasons were: December, January, and February termed winter; March, April, and May termed spring; June, July, and August termed summer; and September, October, and November termed fall.

Basic precipitation and ﬂow patterns for the LREW were calculated. Long term trends were examined through linear correlation and tested for trends using the Mann-Kendall trend test for non-parametric data. Baseﬂow data from each year from 1972 to 2015 (n = 44) as well as each of the four seasons for each individual year were examined independently. A BFI for each year and each season was determined. Average, coefﬁcient of variation, maximum, and minimum were determined for the annual data as well as each of the four seasons. Linear correlations and residuals were examined using the F-test.

3. Results
3.1. Precipitation and streamﬂow patterns
Long term watershed weighted precipitation and streamﬂow patterns for the LRW were examined for the period from 1972 to 2015 (Fig. 3). The average annual watershed weighted precipitation for this period was 1200 mm while the long term average annual streamﬂow was 320 mm, 27% of annual precipitation. Tests of the variability in the precipitation over time indicated no signiﬁcant change (␣ = 0.05). No trend was observed in either the streamﬂow or the precipitation data over the 44 year period (␣=0.05). Examination of precipitation and streamﬂow by season indicated no signiﬁcant trends in the seasonal data either (␣ = 0.05).
Observed average monthly precipitation in the watershed was greatest in the months of January through March and June through August (Fig. 4). Average area weighted monthly streamﬂow peaked during the month of March (Fig. 4). Average monthly streamﬂow from June through November was small (Fig. 4).

3.2. Baseﬂow
Examination of the 44 years of annual ﬂow data produced an average BFI of 0.53 (Table 1). By difference, the fraction of stormﬂow was 0.47. Baseﬂow was the greatest during the months from December through May (0.55–0.57) and the least during the months from June through November (0.43–0.46) (Table 1). There were seven years where there was not enough summer ﬂow to obtain baseﬂow estimates and eleven years where there was not enough fall ﬂow to obtain estimates. Variability of the annual data were low (CV = 7.6%) while that of the fall BFI was larger (27.7%). Summer and fall streamﬂow can be dramatically inﬂuenced by tropical depressions in the region, leading to greater variability in precipitation (Bosch et al., 1999) and streamﬂow during these periods. No long term trends in BFI were found in either the annual or seasonal data (␣=0.05) (Fig. 5), indicating as with precipitation and streamﬂow that baseﬂow has remained stable over time.

Relationships between annual watershed weighted precipitation and annual BFI were examined (Fig. 6). Annual baseﬂow index was found to decrease as a function of increasing precipitation (␣ = 0.01). This is attributed to the saturated soil and aquifer conditions that accompany high precipitation periods. The LREW contains shallow surﬁcial aquifers that ﬂow toward and saturate the ﬂoodplains (Asmussen, 1971; Bosch et al., 2003), the shallow water table conditions lead to saturation across large portions of the watershed. Bosch et al. (2006) determined that 30% of the LREW was contained in these lowlying saturated riparian buffer areas. As a consequence, high precipitation conditions saturate the ﬂoodplain and the surﬁcial aquifer. While groundwater ﬂow persists under these conditions, the saturated conditions lead to high saturation excess surface runoff and a higher proportion of streamﬂow coming from surface runoff. Examination of the seasonal data indicate the winter and spring seasons have the same trend between BFI and precipitation as the annual data but the relationships were not signiﬁcant. The summer and fall seasons have no discernable trend.
Both streamﬂow and baseﬂow increase with increasing precipitation (Fig. 7). The rate of increase in streamﬂow with increasing precipitation exceeds the rate of increase in baseﬂow with increasing precipitation (Fig. 7). This is further indication that conditions of high precipitation lead to increases in saturation excess ﬂow in this watershed, increasing the surface runoff component of streamﬂow at a more rapid rate than the baseﬂow component. 4. Discussion
Typically hydrologic simulations target a single BFI and do not make seasonal adjustments. The greatest difference observed here between the annual BFI and the seasonal BFI’s was with the summer data, where a 10% difference in BFI was observed. The next greatest difference was with the fall data where a 7% difference was observed. However, in this region summer and fall ﬂows are typically small (Fig. 4). Despite large differences in BFI in the summer and the fall, volume differences in these periods remain small. Seasonally, 37% of the annual precipitation and 70% of the annual streamﬂow occurs in the ﬁrst four months of the calendar year. Examining the difference in baseﬂow area weighted ﬂow estimates using the annual BFI versus the seasonal BFI indicates that in terms of area weighted baseﬂow, the greatest differences in estimated ﬂow would be in March and April. If the annual BFI is used the March-April estimate of baseﬂow is 60 mm whereas

it is 64 mm if the seasonal BFI is used. Even during the seasons of high baseﬂow, the differences obtained using the seasonal data do not warrant separating out the data for seasonal analysis.
Eckhardt (2012) used the two parameter digital ﬁlter to examine 65 North American catchments and reported values ranging from 0.67 for perennial streams with porous aquifers to 0.42 for ephemeral streams with porous aquifers. The LREW would be classiﬁed as a perennial stream with a porous aquifer. Santhi et al. (2008) estimated baseﬂow for the conterminous United States using the single parameter digital ﬁlter method during low evapotranspiration (fall and winter) months and reported BFI ranges of 0.40-0.50 for the LREW region. Our results indicate these estimates may be biased low due to the exclusion of the summer period. Shrimohammadi et al. (1984) reported BFIs ranging from 0.58 to 0.81 for Little River watersheds ranging in scale from 2.6 to 334 km2 for the period from 1968 to 1981, with an estimate of 0.68 for the watershed reported here. They further reported a BFI of 0.79 for a 1494 km2 portion of the Little River (1968–1970). Novak et al. (2003) studied four Coastal Plain subwatersheds from 314 to 1036 ha and found BFI to range from 0.58 to 0.73, also utilizing the single parameter digital ﬁlter method of Arnold and Allen (1999). These watersheds are similar in characteristics to the LREW watersheds. Priest (2004) characterized BFI for the 3600 km2 neighboring Alapaha River watershed using the USGS HYSEP method (Sloto and Crouse, 1996). BFI for the Alapaha River which is similar in characteristics to the LREW was reported as 0.56 for the period from 1971 to 2001 (Priest, 2004). These reported values from the literature are generally greater than the annual average BFI of 0.53 found here. In some cases, this can be attributed to studying different climatic seasons and the application of different methods (Santhi et al., 2008; Shrimohammadi et al., 1984; Novak et al., 2003; Priest, 2004). As reported by Ekhardt (2008), the two parameter digital ﬁlter can reduce high BFI estimates. For the LREW, the method may include greater portions of the interﬂow into stormﬂow and less into baseﬂow.
Esralew and Lewis (2010) examined seasonal trends in BFI for several watersheds throughout the state of Oklahoma. BFI calculated from annual data were consistently less than those observed for the winter-spring periods while they were consistently greater than those for the summer-fall periods, consistent with the results we found for the LREW. It is anticipated that on an annual basis, periods of drought would have a larger fraction of streamﬂow generated by baseﬂow. The relationship illustrated by Fig. 6 indicates that years with smaller annual precipitation have higher BFIs. Drought periods were observed from 1999 to 2002 (average annual rainfall of 970 mm), 2006–2007 (avg. = 865 mm), and 2011–2012

(avg. = 879 mm). Combined, the average BFI for these periods was 0.56, only slightly larger than the long term average of 0.53.
The analysis provided here provides a less subjective more repeatable estimate of BFI utilizing data speciﬁc for this watershed. However, as discussed in the methods, selection of the BFImax and ␣ parameters can be quite subjective and subject to uncertainty. As seen here, considerable year to year variability in baseﬂow can be expected (Fig. 5). Other studies have quantiﬁed the variability in BFI from 0.10 to 0.30 (Rumsey et al., 2015). Here annual BFI was found to vary from 0.45 to 0.62 with a CV of 7.6%. In this analysis we elected to select BFImax equal to 0.80 based upon the recommendations provide by Eckhardt (2005). Fitting using multiple recession curves yielded an ␣ value of 0.98. Eckhardt (2012) indicated for each percent error in ␣ one could expect −0.77% error in BFI. Similarly, a 0.26% error in BFI could be expected for each percent error in BFImax. For this study we believe the error in the estimate of BFI due to the estimate of ␣ to be within 2%.
The 0.53 estimate of BFI obtained from the annual data provides an annual average estimate of baseﬂow of 169 mm (CV = 48%) for a long term average annual precipitation of 1200 mm (CV = 16%) and an average annual streamﬂow of 320 mm (CV = 49%). Conversely average annual stormﬂow is anticipated to be 151 mm. These estimates of baseﬂow and stormﬂow will provide reasonable target values for hydrologic simulation of the LREW with stormﬂow containing both surface runoff and the rapid component of interﬂow. Estimates for this watershed indicate a time to peak of 3 days for this watershed (Sheridan, 1994). Examination of stormﬂow and baseﬂow hydrographs using the annual BFI estimates derived here indicate stormﬂow has an average duration of seven days (Fig. 8). Prior observations indicate it is reasonable to expect that rapid interﬂow could contribute to stormﬂow over a period of seven days following a rainfall event (Asmussen and Ritchie, 1969; Hubbard and Sheridan, 1983; Bosch et al., 2012). In contrast, Shrimohammadi et al. (1984) had assumed a storm runoff duration of four days for this Little River watershed. Assuming a shorter storm runoff duration than was observed here would have led to proportioning a greater portion of streamﬂow to baseﬂow as previously reported.
5. Conclusions
Annually, baseﬂow was found to produce 53% of annual streamﬂow with a CV of 7.6%. Baseﬂow was the greatest during the months from December through May (55–57%) and the least during the months from June through November (43–46%). Annual BFI was found to decrease with increasing annual precipitation. Conversely, baseﬂow is greater during years of low precipitation, indicating the estimation of baseﬂow for low precipitation drought years may be more critical. During high precipitation years streamﬂow is dominated by saturation excess driven surface runoff leading to higher proportional stormﬂow. The relationship between BFI and annual rainfall observed here is expected to be different for watersheds not dominated by surﬁcial aquifer processes. No long term trends were found in either the precipitation, ﬂow, or BFI data, indicating no statistically signiﬁcant hydrologic long term changes within the LREW.
These new assessments of BFI should prove useful for hydrologic simulation of the LREW. Prior targets used for the watershed of 0.68 would lead to overestimation of the baseﬂow component. The 0.53 BFI estimate presented here indicates that prior estimates may have incorporated a larger component of interﬂow into baseﬂow estimates. An average stormﬂow duration of seven days was determined here, including both surface runoff and the faster portion of interﬂow. Because interﬂow has the potential to have signiﬁcantly different chemical characteristics than either direct surface runoff or groundwater ﬂow, future research that better characterizes the separation of interﬂow from direct surface runoff and groundwater ﬂow is warranted. One possible method may be to utilize tracer methods to separate these processes.
As indicated by previous research, streamﬂow volume in this watershed is the greatest from January through April. During this period groundwater contributions to streamﬂow are the greatest. Conversely, streamﬂow during the months from September through November can be unreliable due to diminishing baseﬂow, high evapotranspiration, and largely

unsaturated conditions. Streamﬂow during the summer and winter months contains a higher proportion of surface runoff. Surface runoff has the potential to be of reduced water quality compared to groundwater. These seasonal patterns can have a signiﬁcant impact on regional agriculture as well as coastal estuaries that both rely heavily upon streamﬂow. The observations provided here should improve hydrologic representation of regional watersheds as well as water quality loadings.
