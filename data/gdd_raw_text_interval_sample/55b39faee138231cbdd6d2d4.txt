Abstract

Introduction

Gravity and magnetic data, when integrated with other geophysical, geological, and rock-property data, provide a regional framework to view the subsurface geology in the southwestern Nevada volcanic field. We have loosely divided the region into six domains based on structural style and overall geophysical character. For each domain, we review the subsurface tectonic and magmatic features that have been inferred or interpreted from previous geophysical work. Where possible, we note abrupt changes in geophysical fields as evidence for potential structural or lithologic control on ground-water flow. We use inferred lithology to suggest associated hydrogeologic units in the subsurface. The resulting framework provides a basis for investigators to develop hypotheses for regional ground-water pathways where no drill-hole information exists.
We discuss subsurface features in the northwestern part of the Nevada Test Site and west of the Nevada Test Site in more detail to address potential controls on regional groundwater flow away from areas of underground nuclear-weapons testing at Pahute Mesa. Subsurface features of hydrogeologic importance in these areas are (1) the resurgent intrusion below Timber Mountain, (2) a NNE.-trending fault system coinciding with western margins of the Silent Canyon and Timber Mountain caldera complexes, (3) a north-striking, buried fault east of Oasis Mountain extending for 15 km, which we call the Hogback fault, and (4) an east-striking transverse fault or accommodation zone that, in part, bounds Oasis Valley basin on the south, which we call the Hot Springs fault. In addition, there is no geophysical nor geologic evidence for a substantial change in subsurface physical properties within a corridor extending from the northwestern corner of the Rainier Mesa caldera to Oasis Valley basin (east of Oasis Valley discharge area). This observation supports the hypothesis of other investigators that regional ground water from Pahute Mesa is likely to follow a flow path that extends southwestward to Oasis Valley discharge area.

The southwestern Nevada volcanic field has been the focus of extensive geologic, hydrologic, and geophysical investigations by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) and other agencies for more than 30 years. The studies were conducted in support of underground nuclear-weapons testing at the Nevada Test Site and nuclear waste storage activities at Yucca Mountain, funded by the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) and its predecessor agencies. Laczniak and others (1996) summarized the state of knowledge about ground-water systems in the Nevada Test Site and Yucca Mountain region and placed constraints on radionuclide migration away from contaminated test sites.
Because ground water throughout the area occurs at depths typically greater than 500 m (Laczniak and others, 1996), studies must rely on subsurface information to understand structural or lithologic controls on ground-water flow. Although a vast data set of subsurface geologic information from hundreds of deep (> 600 m) drill holes is available (Ferguson and others, 1994), these data are limited to local areas. The local areas are primarily near nuclear test sites on the Nevada Test Site and in the vicinity of Yucca Mountain, where a high-level-nuclearwaste repository has been proposed. Thus, many important questions remain that are pivotal to defining ground-water flow paths beyond these local areas (Laczniak and others, 1996). In particular, the deep ground-water system south and southwest of Pahute Mesa is poorly characterized. Better subsurface knowledge of this area is crucial for evaluating the possible flow paths away from the testing areas at Pahute Mesa (fig. 1).
In the absence of drill-hole information, geophysical methods provide the best information on major subsurface features that may be controlling ground-water flow. Moreover, where drill-hole information is present, geophysical methods provide important tools for interpolating data between drill holes. In this report we use geophysical data, especially gravity and magnetic data, to develop an integrated geophysical framework of the southwestern Nevada volcanic field. The framework is based on the extensive geophysical interpretations by previous investigators and on recent interpretations from new geophysical, geological, and rock-property information west of the Nevada Test Site. We identify subsurface features that have potential hydrogeologic importance and provide more detailed evaluation of features in the vicinity of potential flow paths from Pahute Mesa.

Regional Setting
The southwestern Nevada volcanic field is in the southwestern Great Basin near and within several sensitive Federal facilities, including the Nevada Test Site, Yucca Mountain, and Nellis Air Force Base Range (fig. 1). The Great Basin, with its pronounced pattern of elongated mountain ranges and intervening basins, evolved as a result of regional crustal extension that took place during middle to late Cenozoic time. This extension represents the latter stages of a diverse history of tectonism, volcanism, and sedimentation, where younger events overprinted older events in ways that are sometimes difficult to unravel.
In Late Proterozoic and early Paleozoic time, nearly 5.5 km of marine carbonate and clastic sediments were deposited on Proterozoic crystalline basement in the southwestern Nevada volcanic field region. An additional 2.5 km of sediments were deposited during Devonian to Mississippian time, when marine sedimentation was intermixed with periods of major

compressional tectonics throughout the Great Basin (Trexler and others, 1996). In Late Cretaceous time, small granitic stocks intruded major thrust faults and related folds in Paleozoic sedimentary rocks. The thrust faults may be Mesozoic, or perhaps as old as Permian (Snow, 1992). In the early Tertiary, from 45 to 17 Ma, while much of the rest of the Great Basin was experiencing widespread ash-flow eruptions and episodes of extension (Noble, 1972; Christiansen and Yeats, 1992), the southwestern Nevada volcanic field region experienced minor volcanism and perhaps major episodes of tectonism.
From 17 to 9 Ma, the southwestern Nevada volcanic field developed as a result of episodic, voluminous magmatism and variably intense extension (Sawyer and others, 1994; Hudson and others, 1994). The first part of this tectonism predates the southwestern Nevada volcanic field, at perhaps 16 Ma (Fridrich, 1999). Magmatism began at about 15.2 Ma and culminated in voluminous rhyolite eruptions from a complex of large ash-flow calderas between 12.8 and 11.4 Ma. After this period of intense volcanism, activity began to wane and change to bimodal

rhyolite-basalt magmatism followed by entirely basaltic eruptions. The silicic ash-flow tuffs and lesser silicic and mafic lava flows of the southwestern Nevada volcanic field cover an area of
SJ
>10,000 km and reach thicknesses of 4 km or more in the center of the field (Ferguson and others, 1994). Each of the silicic ash-flow tuffs is associated with one or more calderas in the center of the volcanic field. Extension around the perimeters of the southwestern Nevada volcanic field occurred during and after the episode of magmatism but varied in intensity, timing, and style from area to area (Hudson and others, 1994). From 9 Ma to the present, volcanism and tectonism in the southwestern Nevada volcanic field have progressively declined.
The southwestern Nevada volcanic field is associated with some distinctive geophysical characteristics that are unique to Nevada. The central area of overlapping caldera complexes corresponds to a large, regional gravity low that includes the lowest values in the State (Saltus, 1988a). This gravity minimum led to the discovery of the mostly buried Silent Canyon caldera complex (Healey, 1968). Along the southern edge of the southwestern Nevada volcanic field, a change in upper-crust lithology and mantle elevation is expressed as major east-trending gradients in topography, gravity, heat flow, crustal thickness, and aeromagnetic data (Eaton and others, 1978; Saltus and Thompson, 1995). The southwestern Nevada volcanic field area is situated at the southeastern termination of the Walker Lane belt, a 100- to 300km-wide by 700-km-long northwest-trending zone of irregular topography, discontinuous strike-slip faults, and northwesttrending linear magnetic anomalies near the southern NevadaCalifornia border (fig. 1) (Stewart, 1988; Blakely, 1988). To the east of the southwestern Nevada volcanic field, including most of eastern Nevada, is a region of generally low magnetic character known as the "quiet zone," the significance of which is still unclear (Blakely, 1988).
Hydrogeologic Background
Regional Hydrology
The study area is within the Death Valley ground-water system (Winograd and Thordarson, 1975; Waddell and others, 1984; Harrill and others, 1988; Laczniak and others, 1996). Recharge areas for the system are the high mountain ranges of centra] and southern Nevada, primarily to the north of the southwestern Nevada volcanic field. Ground water is transmitted generally southward at depths of more than 500 m through predominantly carbonate aquifers on the east and through predominantly volcanic aquifers and possibly alluvial aquifers on the west. Ground water within the eastern, carbonate-aquifer-dominated area discharges at springs in Ash Meadows (fig. 2) (Winograd and Thordarson, 1975; Laczniak and others, 1996). Ground water within the western, volcanicaquifer-dominated area discharges at springs in Oasis Valley and through evaporative processes at Alkali Flat (fig. 2) (Waddell and others, 1984; Laczniak and others, 1996). Within the Nevada Test Site, the two different aquifer areas are separated by a long, nearly continuous structural block of

Paleozoic confining units that create a northerly trending ground-water divide marked by a regional-scale hydraulic gradient (fig. 2) (Laczniak and others, 1996).
In the area of extensive drill-hole control at Pahute Mesa, Blankennagel and Weir (1973, plate 1) identified a prominent, 120-m change in water level that they considered to be a hydraulic barrier. More recently, O'Hagan and Laczniak (1996) have reclassified the feature as a water-level discontinuity (fig. 2). Based on subsurface geologic data (Healey, 1968; Orkild and others, 1968; Sawyer and others, 1994), the location of the discontinuity coincides with the western margin of the Silent Canyon caldera complex (fig. 1). However, no hydrologic data exist to constrain the southern extent of the discontinuity.
Hydrogeologic Units
Although the region can be generally divided into carbonate-aquifer-dominated versus volcanic-aquifer-dominated systems, the hydrogeology of these systems is not simple. Large lateral changes in subsurface thickness and character of rocks are common. These variations mostly result from (1) primary variations in geometry and thickness of rock units, (2) structural deformation of pre-Tertiary and, to a lesser extent, Tertiary rocks, (3) secondary thermal-related or diagenetic processes that have altered the mineralogy or physical properties of the rocks, and (4) fracturing that has changed permeability (Laczniak and others, 1996). In addition, faults can be important either as conduits for or as barriers to ground-water flow.
From a regional perspective, the southwestern Nevada volcanic field region can be subdivided into nine hydrogeologic units (Laczniak and others, 1996). The following brief descriptions of these hydrogeologic units are from Laczniak and others (1996) and Cole and others (1994).
The sedimentary rocks of Late Proterozoic and Paleozoic age, which have a total undeformed thickness of about 10 km in the southwestern Nevada volcanic field region, comprise four of the hydrogeologic units: the quartzite confining unit (3 km thick), the lower carbonate aquifer (4.2 km thick), the Eleana confining unit (as much as 2 km thick), and the upper carbonate aquifer (1 km thick, only locally preserved). The quartzite confining unit forms the hydrologic basement of the Death Valley flow system, above which the lower carbonate aquifer transmits the greatest flow of ground water relative to other aquifers in the region. The Eleana confining unit, designated by Laczniak and others (1996), includes rocks that were previously considered part of the Eleana Formation but are now considered to be part of the Chainman Shale (Cashman and Trexler, 1991). However, we keep the Eleana name for the sake of consistency. The unit consists of clastic sedimentary rock that is as much as 2 km thick in this area, but, due mostly to structural deformation in the subsurface, the unit is confined to a narrow band ringing the southern and eastern interface between the southwestern Nevada volcanic field and the carbonate aquifer system. The upper carbonate aquifer is not geographically significant.
The hydrogeologic unit termed "granite" consists of granitic intrusions that are scattered throughout the region.

These include Mesozoic intrusions that intrude pre-Tertiary sedimentary rocks and Tertiary intrusions related to caldera resurgence or late-stage magmatism. Intrusions consist of crystalline rocks that, in this region, are generally impermeable to ground-water flow.

The Tertiary section is a complex assemblage that includes welded and nonwelded tuffs, lava flows, and minor clastic and carbonate sedimentary rocks. Individual rock units may be variable in hydrologic properties both vertically and laterally. Thus, although particular geologic units cannot easily be

assigned to one hydrogeologic unit, three hydrogeologic units are generally characterized by rock type: lava-flow aquifer, welded-tuff aquifer, and tuff confining unit. Welded-tuff and lava-flow aquifers transmit ground water primarily through fracture permeability. Although somewhat less productive than the carbonate aquifers, these volcanic aquifers dominate in the western part of the southwestern Nevada volcanic field. The tuff confining unit mainly refers to nonwelded tuffs in which the primary permeability was destroyed during alteration of the volcanic glass to zeolites and other secondary minerals.
The valley-fill aquifer, which consists of upper Miocene to Holocene alluvium, is an important component of the saturatedzone hydrologic system of the southwestern Nevada volcanic field region only within a few deep alluvial basins where the water table is generally shallow. Outside of these basins, alluvium represents the unsaturated zone.

Although results derived from these different types of geophysical data provide invaluable constraints on knowledge of the subsurface, all but gravity and magnetic data are acquired either at individual locations or along profiles, so that information is concentrated only in certain areas. In this report, we focus on the gravity and magnetic data to give a regional map view of the subsurface. The interpretations of the gravity and magnetic data, however, result from integration with the results of other geophysical methods, subsurface drilling information, and geologic mapping. Many of the interpretations rely heavily on the efforts of previous workers. Our detailed discussions concentrate on recently reported interpretations that incorporate new aeromagnetic data west of the Nevada Test Site (Grauch and others, 1997).
Gravity Data

Geophysical Background
Geophysical studies of the southwestern Nevada volcanic field have been conducted for decades concurrently with geologic and hydrologic studies and have provided constraints on the subsurface distribution of rock types in the upper crust. The geophysical methods that have been employed include gravity; ground-based and airborne magnetic methods; seismic reflection and refraction: teleseismic, heat-flow, borehole-geophysical, and a variety of deep-looking electrical methods, primarily the magnetotelluric method. Major results of these studies for the Yucca Mountain area are summarized in Oliver, Ponce, and Hunter (1995). Geophysical results from other areas of the southwestern Nevada volcanic field and the Nevada Test Site are scattered in the literature (much of which is not easily available), although some early results are summarized in Eckel (1968).

Data for more than 19,000 stations were extracted from Bouguer gravity data compiled from Saltus (1988a) and Harris and others (1989) by McCafferty and Grauch (1997) then interpolated onto a grid at 100-m intervals. A regional field based on an isostatic model was removed to isolate the gravity effects of rocks in the upper crust (Simpson and Jachens, 1989; fig. 3). The parameters used for the regional field were the same as those used by Saltus (1988b) for the State of Nevada.
The typical value of 2,670 kg/m3 that is used to reduce gravity data is too large to be representative of subsurface densities for large areas of the southwestern Nevada volcanic field (Kane and others, 1981; Snyder and Carr, 1982; table 1). Measurements within boreholes indicate that local density variations can be abrupt and unpredictable, depending on depth, structure, degree of welding, alteration (particularly zeolitization, which decreases density significantly), and water saturation (Healey, 1968; Snyder and Carr, 1982, 1984; Carroll, 1989; Ferguson and

others, 1994). However, rock types can be divided into several general groups of density ranges that are useful for looking at bulk-density averages of the upper crust in the southwestern Nevada volcanic field (table 1). In figure 3, the isostatic residual gravity data is based on a reduction density of 2,400 kg/m , which provides a compromise between the areas of high density surrounding the southwestern Nevada volcanic field versus areas of low density within the southwestern Nevada volcanic field.
The gravity signatures of hydrogeologic units are neither consistent nor unique. However, a few general statements can be made: (1) pre-Tertiary aquifers and confining units have similar densities and therefore cannot be distinguished by gravity signature; (2) tuff confining units, if they confine because of strong zeolitization, are generally less dense than tuff aquifers (Carroll, 1989) because the aquifers generally consist of welded or partly welded tuffs; and (3) valley-fill aquifers and tuff confining units have the lowest densities and may not be distinguishable within alluvial basins (Saltus and Jachens, 1995).
Aeromagnetic Data
Aeromagnetic data for this study were extracted from the compilation prepared by McCafferty and Grauch (1997), who merged 14 individual surveys onto a common observation altitude of 122 m above ground. Most of the area for the present study is covered by two detailed surveys, both flown at 122 m above ground with east-west flight lines spaced 400 m apart (Kane and others, 1981; Grauch and others, 1993, 1997). A lower resolution survey covers the area from lat 36°45'N. to lat 37°N. and long 116°37.5'W. to long 116°45'W. It was originally flown at 300 m above ground with north-south flight lines spaced 800 m apart (Langenheim and others, 1991).
Interpretation of aeromagnetic data for the southwestern Nevada volcanic field must account for highly variable remanent magnetization and topography composed of magnetic rocks (Grauch and others, 1997). Remanent magnetization of volcanic rocks and ash-flow tuffs in particular can be quite variable, ranging from low to high intensities, sometimes within the same unit. Thus, the total magnetization (vector sum of induced and remanent component) is important to consider rather than just magnetic susceptibility or paleomagnetic direction (Bath, 1968; Grauch, 1987a). Total magnetizations are the vector sums of induced and remanent magnetization components, which can be estimated from natural remanent magnetization and magnetic susceptibility measurements and the intensity of the Earth's field. In this report we commonly refer to positive- or negativeinclination total magnetization. Inclinations are measured down from horizontal and are positive if greater than 25°, negative if less than -25° and anomalous if in between. Total magnetization intensities are classified as suggested by Bath and Jahren

(1984): nonmagnetic, <0.05 A/m; weak, between 0.05 and 0.5 A/m; moderate, between 0.5 and 1.5 A/m; and strong, >1.5 A/m. Relative total magnetizations of selected volcanic units for the study area are presented in table 2.
In general, the total magnetizations of units in the study area are collinear with the Earth's field direction within 25°, a criterion suggested by Bath (1968) and discussed for this area by Grauch and others (1997). Given this general collinearity, the magnetic data were transformed by reduction-to-the-pole (fig. 4) in order to place anomalies directly over their sources (see Blakely, 1995).
Magnetic interpretation in areas of rugged topography can use relations between anomaly shapes and topographic shapes to determine whether the source of the anomaly composes the topography or is at depth (Grauch, 1987b). Positive correlation with topography indicates that rocks composing the topography have positive-inclination total magnetization; inverse correlation indicates negative-inclination total magnetization. Lack of correlation with topography or with mapped extent of geologic units suggests that the magnetic source underlies units exposed at the surface. Thus, magnetic interpretation in the southwestern Nevada volcanic field was accomplished by inspection of magnetic anomalies compared to topographic shapes, extent of mapped units, and using input from rock-magnetic-property measurements (Grauch and others, 1997).
The magnetic signatures of hydrogeologic units, like their gravity signatures, are neither consistent nor unique. However, several general statements can be made: (1) welded-tuff aquifers commonly have strong total magnetization; (2) lava-flow aquifers commonly have strong total magnetization but are limited spatially; (3) tuff confining units are not expected to produce magnetic anomalies because of alteration; and (4) valley-fill aquifers, if they are composed primarily of alluvium, have negligible magnetization relative to volcanic units.
Geophysical-Structural Domains
To a first order, the isostatic residual gravity map (fig. 3) shows fundamental differences in bulk density of the crust that are related to structural relief on the pre-Tertiary basement. The high values show where dense, pre-Tertiary rocks are near the surface; the low values show where these rocks are at great depths, buried by 3 km or more of low-density volcanic rocks (Saltus and Jachens, 1995). Minor variations in gravity values can be due to minor relief on the top of pre-Tertiary rocks or density variations within pre-Tertiary rocks (table 1).
Regional variations in the magnetic map (fig. 4) are harder to see than in the gravity map because the magnetic data are sensitive to shallow sources. In order to see regional variations, we computed the magnetic potential of the data (fig. 5). The magnetic potential is an integration of the data (often called pseudogravity—Baranov, 1957; Blakely, 1995). The operation is a lowpass filter that maximizes the broad variations in the data and minimizes the local ones. The map has been further filtered by the terracing method of Cordell and McCafferty (1989) in order to bring out discrete areas that have similar values, analogous to a terraced hillside.

The values on the magnetic potential map (fig. 5) can be viewed as a general indicator of the relative bulk magnetization of the upper crust. At great depth, bulk magnetization is likely dominated by the induced component due to thermal demagnetization of the remanent component (McElhinny, 1973). Thus, high bulk magnetization may imply the presence of large volumes of igneous rocks of intermediate composition at depth.
The broad regional variations in character on the gravity, magnetic, and magnetic potential maps show general correspondence to areas that have fundamental differences in the style, timing, and magnitude of structural deformation and magmatism recognized in the southwestern Nevada volcanic field region (Fridrich and others, 1996). Thus, for ease of discussion of the geophysical framework, we have divided the region into six geophysical-structural domains (fig. 6). These domains are not strictly defined but are generally (and sometimes subjectively) based on differences in geophysical characteristics that relate to differences in structural style.
Within each domain, we used gravity and magnetic evidence integrated with other available geologic, geophysical, and rock-property information to identify and delineate many of the features shown on figure 7. Precise locations of the outlines on figure 7 were guided primarily by the maximum horizontal gradients of the gravity or magnetic-potential data, which are commonly associated with the surface projections of near-vertical physical-property boundaries (Cordell, 1979; Cordell and Grauch, 1985; Blakely and Simpson, 1986). These locations can be offset downdip if the boundaries have shallower dip (Grauch and Cordell, 1987). We have only included major features that cover fairly large areas or have significant linear extent. Those that can be confidently identified geologically are explained in table 3 and keyed to the letter labels on figure 7. Those that are buried and (or) have not been confidently identified geologically are discussed in table 4 and keyed to the number labels on figure 7. Explanations of the interpretations are confined to the tables where possible. More detailed discussion is given to those features within and south and southwest of Pahute Mesa that may have bearing on regional ground-water flow from Pahute Mesa.
In the following discussions of features within each domain, we will simplify parenthetical references to features that are apparent on a particular geophysical figure by listing the feature number or letter from figure 7 along with the appropriate geophysical figure number or numbers. For example, the gravity feature labeled as 24 on figure 7 and described under feature 24 in table 4 will be referenced parenthetically as "(24 compared to fig. 3)." Reference to figure 7 and the appropriate table is implied. To identify features without comparison to geophysical figures, the label number or letter will appear with reference to figure 7, such as "(ATT. fig. 7)." To locate the features on the geophysical figures, we highly recommend that the reader prepare a transparency of figure 7 for use as an overlay.
Timber Mountain Domain
The major domain of the study area is the Timber Mountain domain (fig. 6), which consists of a central area of caldera complexes and bordering areas of thick Tertiary rocks. The domain is

characterized by its voluminous Tertiary magmatism (maximum eruption rate of thousands of km3/m.y.) and a lack of the moderate-to-strong late Miocene structural deformation that is evident in adjacent domains (Hudson and others, 1994). The boundaries of the Timber Mountain domain are mostly defined as the limit of the strong gravity low (fig. 3), which locally extends beyond the area of identified calderas. A notable exception to this definition is the Black Mountain caldera, which is associated with a gravity high (BM compared to fig. 3). The domain is also characterized by moderate to high bulk magnetization (fig. 5) and numerous high-amplitude magnetic anomalies (fig. 4), caused primarily by widespread ash-flow tuffs.
The area of low gravity that generally defines the Timber Mountain domain—and, by inference, the area of thick Tertiary rocks—extends beyond the margins of the identified calderas (fig. 7 compared to fig. 3). These surrounding areas probably represent additional buried calderas in some places and volcanic and sedimentary fill within tectonic basins in other places. Buried (unidentified) calderas are likely present because several of the older (pre-13 Ma) ash-flow tuff units of the volcanic field have sufficient volume to infer that they were ejected from large calderas, yet no caldera sources for these units have been identified (Sawyer and others, 1994). Geophysical evidence for buried calderas are arcuate gravity gradients, such as along the northern part of the western domain boundary (west of feature 12 compared to fig. 3). Evidence that tectonic subsidence has occurred in the area are (1) thick (> 600 m) Tertiary basin-filling volcanic and sedimentary sequences deposited during the earliest period of evolution of the southwestern Nevada volcanic field (pre-13.5 Ma) that are in the vicinity of the Rock Valley fault (RV, fig. 7) (Hinrichs, 1968) and in two places near Bare Mountain (fig. 6) (Swadley and Carr, 1987; Monsen and others, 1992); (2) a buried, pre-13-Ma graben identified in the subsurface in Crater Flat (26, fig. 7) (Fridrich, Dudley, and Stuckless, 1994); and (3) linear segments of the boundary of the Timber Mountain gravity low, which is typical of the gravity signature of a tectonic fault, such as along the central part of the western boundary of the Timber Mountain domain (24 compared to fig. 3).
Calderas and Caldera-Related Features
The predominant features of the Timber Mountain domain are calderas and caldera-related features (fig. 7 compared to fig. 6). Identified calderas include the Area 20 and Grouse Canyon calderas (A20 and GC, fig. 7), comprising the Silent Canyon caldera complex (fig. 1); the nested Ammonia Tanks and Rainier Mesa calderas (ATT, ATS and RMT, RMS, respectively, fig. 7), comprising the Timber Mountain caldera complex (fig. 1); Black Mountain caldera (BM, fig. 7), and the Claim Canyon caldera (CC, fig. 7). The outlines for these calderas are from Sawyer and others (1994, 1995), who based their locations on surface geologic contacts, thickness differences between caldera-forming and post-caldera units, and on scattered to tightly constrained subsurface drill-hole information (Warren and others, 1985; Ferguson and others, 1994). Ferguson and others (1994) interpret slightly different locations for parts of the caldera margins within the Silent Canyon caldera complex. The caldera margins

are dashed on figure 7 where locations are based on previous geophysical arguments (Sawyer and others, 1994). In a modification to the margins of Sawyer and others (1994), we have not drawn the southwestern margin of the Rainier Mesa caldera on figure 7.
The Grouse Canyon (13.7 Ma; GC, fig. 7) and Area 20 (13.25 Ma; A20. fig. 7) calderas of the Silent Canyon caldera complex are beneath Pahute Mesa (fig. 1). Both calderas are completely buried by younger deposits and were first identified by gravity studies (Healey, 1968; Orkild and others, 1968). Subsequently, more than a hundred deep (> 600 m) drill holes have defined the subsurface distribution of volcanic units in the complex (Warren and others, 1985; Sawyer and Sargent, 1989; Ferguson and others, 1994; Sawyer and others, 1994). The eastern margin of the Grouse Canyon caldera and the northern topographic wall of the Silent Canyon caldera complex are reflected in abrupt changes in magnetic anomaly patterns (fig. 7 compared to fig. 4). The western margin of the complex coincides with a water-level discontinuity in northwestern Nevada Test Site (WLD, fig. 2) and a major gravity gradient, discussed under the section on NNE.-trending structures.
The oldest caldera of the Timber Mountain caldera complex, the Rainier Mesa caldera, formed in response to the eruption of the Rainier Mesa Tuff (Tmr, table 2) at 11.6 Ma. The topographic wall of the caldera (RMT, fig. 7) is not tightly constrained geologically except along the northeastern margin. The topographic wall of the younger Ammonia Tanks caldera (11.45 Ma) is probably superimposed on the structural wall of the Rainier Mesa caldera along the southeastern margin (RMS/ATT, fig. 7). Part of the resurgent, intracaldera dome of the Rainier Mesa caldera is exposed on the west side of the Ammonia Tanks caldera (near ATT western boundary), but the largest part of the caldera was sloped by the Ammonia Tanks caldera or is covered by younger rocks (Sawyer and others, 1994).
The younger caldera of the Timber Mountain caldera complex is the Ammonia Tanks caldera, associated with the Ammonia Tanks Tuff (Tma, table 2). The structural and topographic margins of the caldera (ATS and ATT, respectively, fig. 7) are well exposed around most of the caldera. It is a classic resurgent caldera of the type described by Smith and Bailey (1968), with isolated exposures of intrusive rocks related to resurgence located on the southeast side of Timber Mountain (fig. 6) (Byers, Carr, Christiansen, and others, 1976). The geologic evidence, combined with analysis of the gravity data, led Kane and others (1981) to conclude that the broad, low-amplitude gravity high in this area is the expression of the resurgent intrusion (TM compared to fig. 3). Electrical-data profiles collected over Timber Mountain also indicated rocks with high resistivities at depth, typical of intrusive rock (Zablocki, 1979).
Outlining the lateral extent of the Timber Mountain resurgent intrusion is difficult. Gradients surrounding the gravity high are moderate, especially to the north, indicating that the

intrusive contacts may slope gently downward and have no identifiable vertical "edges" that can be used to define the lateral extent. Another approach considers the lateral extent most important for understanding the hydrogeologic implications of the intrusion. Inversion of regional gravity data (V. Langenheim, written commun., 1997) indicate that the caldera fill is less than 1 km thick within the map area generally outlined by the gravity contour level of-10 mGal (TM compared to fig. 3). Comparison of these thickness estimates to ground-water depths expected for the surrounding area (Laczniak and others. 1996) suggests that the underlying intrusion may interact with ground water near the margins of this area. Therefore the outline of the area (TM, fig. 7) is considered the hydrogeologically important lateral extent of the intrusion. However, the location is approximate because none of the depth estimates are well constrained.
The Claim Canyon caldera (Byers, Carr, Orkild, and others, 1976; Christiansen and others, 1977; Sawyer and others, 1994; Fridrich, 1999) collapsed at 12.7 Ma, accompanied by the eruption of the Tiva Canyon Tuff (Tpc, table 2). Part of the intracaldera dome is exposed south of Timber Mountain, but most of the caldera is beneath the younger Timber Mountain caldera complex. Gravity values within the exposed part of the caldera are higher compared to surrounding areas (CC compared to fig. 3), suggesting the presence of a resurgent intrusion, analogous to the one under Timber Mountain. The caldera margins correspond with an abrupt change in magnetic-anomaly pattern (CC compared to fig. 4).
The Black Mountain caldera is associated with several eruptive events (Sawyer and others, 1994). The topographic margin produced by the most recent event (9.4 Ma; BM, fig. 7) is a contact with precaldera rocks, well-exposed for more than half of its boundary. A fairly thick (>500 m) sequence of mafic trachyte present within the caldera (Sawyer and others, 1995) produces a strong magnetic high (BM compared to figs. 4 and 5). A circular gravity high corresponds fairly well to the caldera outline (BM compared to fig. 3). Gravity models assuming a high-density fill within the caldera cannot entirely explain the lateral extent of the gravity high. Therefore, an intrusion is inferred at depth (Grauch and others, 1997).
Faults at Pahute Mesa
The eastern part of Pahute Mesa has been the site of extensive underground weapons tests (fig. 2), which in many places were detonated near or below the water level (Laczniak and others, 1996). Extensive drill-hole information, in conjunction with gravity and seismic reflection data, gives good control on the identification of important faults and rock units in the subsurface near testing areas (Ferguson and others, 1994). Some of the subsurface faults are also expressed in the magnetic data by changes in magnetic character that occur across the faults in places but are not consistent along the lengths of the faults (fig. 8). This inconsistency and the strong amplitudes imply that the magnetic expressions are primarily due to the juxtaposition of rocks of different magnetic properties at shallow depths. In particular, the Boxcar (B), Almendro (A), and Scurgham Peak (SP) faults are expressed as

Figure 5 (facing page) Color map of magnetic potential (pseudogravity) data to which the terracing operator of Cordell and McCafferty (1989) has been applied. This can be viewed as an indicator of the relative values (in arbitrary units) of bulk magnetization of the subsurface (except where low values correspond to strong negative anomalies that have wide lateral extent). High values correspond to warm colors; low values to cool colors. The dotted pattern shows areas of regionally high values (excluding the Black Mountain caldera, BM), discussed in the text. The boundary of the Nevada Test Site is shown in white, thick black lines are domain boundaries discussed in the text and shown on figure 6.
major changes in magnetic values (fig. 8), primarily reflecting relative differences in elevation of the shallowest, magnetically significant units.
A prominent WNW.-trending lineament in the magnetic data can be traced from the eastern side of Black Mountain to the eastern side of the Timber Mountain domain (18 compared to figs. 4 and 6). The western part of the lineament is expressed as the boundary between strong negative anomalies on the northern side juxtaposed against high magnetic values on the southern side (fig. 8). The central and eastern parts are expressed as linear positive anomalies, in places flanked on either side by strong negative anomalies. The extreme western and eastern parts are also expressed by subtle gravity gradients (Kane and others, 1981) (fig. 8). From its linearity, a structural origin is inferred. However, its genesis and age in relation to caldera development are not well constrained.
North-Northeast-Trending Structures
The western margin of the Silent Canyon caldera complex coincides with a NNE.-trending gravity gradient (14 and 14/SCC compared to fig. 3) (Sawyer and Sargent, 1989; Ferguson and others, 1994) and a water-level discontinuity (O'Hagan and Laczniak, 1996) (WLD, fig. 2). The gravity gradient extends south of the complex and past the western side of the Timber Mountain caldera complex to the valley east of Oasis Mountain (23, fig. 7). Nearly parallel to and west of the gravity gradient is a magnetic gradient (13 compared to fig. 4). The magnetic gradient is best evidenced from the magnetic potential map as the edge of regional magnetic highs (10 and 11 compared to fig. 5). The coherency and linearity of these gradients, the abrupt changes in geophysical character across them (13,14, and 14/SCC compared to figs. 3 and 4), and the relation between the gravity gradient and the Silent Canyon caldera margin (14/SCC compared to fig. 3) indicate that they represent major faults at depth that probably controlled caldera formation.
Regional magnetic highs that are bounded on the east by the NNE.-trending structures correspond to moderately low gravity values (10 and 11 compared to fig. 3). Rough depth estimates made by models of gravity data, and corroborated by magnetic gradient analysis, indicate that the source rocks of these regional magnetic highs extend at least 2 km below the surface. Grauch and others (1997) concluded that the most likely sources of the northern regional magnetic high (10 compared to fig. 4) are the dacite of Mount Helen (Tqm, table 2), the tuff of Tolicha Peak (Tqt, table 2), and locally the comendite of Ribbon Cliff (Ttc,

table 2) on the basis of comparisons to rock-property, geologicmapping, and limited drill-hole information. In addition, they used the absence of negative magnetic anomalies combined with geologic evidence of absent or thinning Rainier Mesa Tuff (Tmr, table 2) to suggest the general absence of the tuff in the area of the regional magnetic high. Where exposed elsewhere in the study area, the Rainier Mesa Tuff is commonly thick, widespread (Sawyer and others, 1995), and consistently associated with strong negative anomalies on the aeromagnetic map (Grauch and others, 1997).
A simple model of a magnetic profile that crosses from the northern regional magnetic high into the Silent Canyon caldera complex (fig. 9) shows that three magnetically significant units (such as the dacite lavas (Tqm), the tuff of Tolicha Peak (Tqt), and the Rainier Mesa Tuff (Tmr)) can explain most of the variations in the magnetic data. Variations not modeled can be explained by variations in thicknesses and magnetizations of shallow rocks. The first-order variations along the profile can be explained by the configuration of the bodies attributed to be dacite lavas. This is especially evident by comparing the fit between observed values after upward continuation by 1 km and the model values calculated at the same high level (fig. 9).
The regional magnetic high that is south of Black Mountain and in the Thirsty Mountain area (11 compared to fig. 4) cannot be explained by exposed units, and therefore the sources cannot be determined definitively. However, Grauch and others (1997) determined probable sources based on similarities and proximity to the regional magnetic high northeast of Black Mountain (10 compared to fig. 4) and expected magnetic properties (table 2). The probable sources include (from table 2) the dacite of Mount Helen (Tqm), the tuff of Tolicha Peak (Tqt), Ammonia Tanks Tuff (Tma), the rhyolite of Fleur-de-lis Ranch (Tff), and locally the comendite of Ribbon Cliff (Ttc).
Oasis Valley Basin
The large area east of Oasis Valley discharge area and west of Timber Mountain (fig. 6) is an area of low gravity values (23 compared to fig. 3), reflecting a thick sequence of moderately low density rocks, likely Tertiary in age. We call the area "Oasis Valley basin" to avoid confusion with the name "Oasis Valley," which has been informally used to include this area as well as the discharge area. Oasis Valley basin is an area of alluvium surrounded by exposures of Tertiary volcanic units (fig. 10). The area shows very little magnetic signature (23 compared to fig. 4). Estimates from gravity data indicate a 5-km thickness of lowdensity rocks within the area (V Langenheim, written commun., 1997). Drill hole MYJO Coffer #1, drilled for oil exploration, penetrated about 240 m of alluvium in the middle of this area. The alluvium lies above Ammonia Tanks Tuff, volcanics of Fortymile Canyon, and younger units (fig. 10). Many of these units are exposed at the surface nearby (fig. 10).
The area of thick, low-density rocks is bounded (1) on the west by the major, inferred, north-striking fault, mainly evident as a major gravity gradient (24 compared to fig. 3), which we informally name the Hogback fault; (2) on the south by an easttrending inferred structure evident in both magnetic and gravity

maps (7 compared to figs. 3 and 4), which we informally name the Hot Springs fault; and (3) on the north by the abrupt, southern edge of a regional magnetic high (southern boundary of the stippled area labeled 11 compared to fig. 4). The eastern boundary and the origin of the thick sequence of low-density rocks beneath this area are unclear.
The linearity of the gravity gradient that delineates the Hogback fault (24 compared to fig. 3) suggests a tectonic origin rather than a caldera origin. The lack of low gravity values to the west of the Hogback fault and the uninterrupted extent of its associated gravity gradient do not support the presence of a major caldera collapse west of the fault. Preliminary models for the gravity gradient indicate a boundary dipping about 45°, which may represent one or a series of normal faults, down to the east. This configuration is similar to the stepped-fault model of the Bare Mountain fault (8, table 4 and references given therein). The northern extent of the Hogback fault, where it passes along the west side of the area of Thirsty Mountain basalts (TH, fig. 7), is parallel to faults mapped at the surface (Minor and others, 1996) and nearly coincides with an east-facing paleoscarp where Ammonia Tanks Tuff was emplaced against volcanics of Quartz Mountain (Noble and others, 1991; Sawyer and others, 1995). Previous workers have interpreted this paleoscarp as evidence for a caldera topographic wall, although they disagree on the age of the caldera (Byers, Carr, Orkild, and others, 1976; Noble and others, 1991). The paleoscarp may be surface evidence of the inferred tectonic fault or of caldera collapse that was controlled by the fault.
Evidence suggests that the Hot Springs fault (7, fig. 7) is a near-vertical transverse fault or accommodation zone (Grauch and others, 1997). Such evidence includes the steepness of the gravity gradient on the eastern half of the fault, abrupt change in magnetic character and linearity across the entire fault, change in slope of the gravity gradient on either side of the Hogback fault, and configuration of the Hot Springs fault in relation to the Hogback and Bare Mountain faults (8 and 24, fig. 7). Geologic evidence south of the fault indicates a paleoscarp there, with a depositional basin to the north during and perhaps before the time of deposition of the Rainier Mesa Tuff (C. Fridrich, unpub. data, 1996).
Other Domains

The western domain underwent a complex middle Miocene tectonic and volcanic history, followed by deposition of young (post-10 Ma) volcanic rocks and alluvium that cover much of the area. The southern boundary of the western domain (fig. 6) is generally located along the Bullfrog Hills-Fluorspar Canyon detachment fault (Maldonado, 1990). The repeated faulting of the upper plate of this fault is especially evident in the magnetic data in the southern Bullfrog Hills by the striped pattern of north-trending anomalies (the area between BA and 7 compared to fig. 4), similar to the pattern in Crater Flat and Yucca Mountain (the area between CF and 28 compared to fig. 4) (Bath and Jahren, 1984). Although many minor faults can be interpreted from the striped magnetic patterns, only one major fault has been identified within the western domain (5, fig. 7). This fault marks an abrupt change between north-south orientation (on the northwest) and northeast orientation (on the southeast) of the grain of tilted fault blocks (5 compared to fig. 4). On the extreme west side of the domain is Sarcobatus Flat (SF, fig. 7), a basin that developed post-10 Ma (Minor and others, 1991). The low gravity values indicate that this is a deep basin (SF compared to fig. 3); the strong, broad, low magnetic anomaly indicates a downdropped block of volcanic rock having negative-inclination magnetization (SF compared to fig. 4) (Grauch and others, 1997).
In the areas of outcrop, the magnetic expression of volcanic units can be identified by inspection (CR, OM, SM compared to fig. 4). Other areas show high-amplitude magnetic anomalies indicative of volcanic units but are covered entirely by Quaternary alluvium (3 and 6 compared to fig. 4). Many exposed volcanic units in the northwestern part of the study area (1, fig. 7) do not correspond in location to magnetic anomalies (1 compared to fig. 4), suggesting that the magnetic sources are buried.
The prominent, elliptical gravity low in the north-central part of the domain (4 compared to fig. 3) is in an area with very few rock exposures and is associated with discontinuities or changes in character in the magnetic map (4 compared to fig. 4). Analysis of gravity and magnetic data in this area indicates a depression in the high-density pre-Tertiary rocks (Grauch and others, 1997). Evidence that supports a caldera origin for the depression is primarily the presence of rhyolite domes within the gravity low. The depression may be the caldera source of the tuff of Sleeping Butte (Tqs, table 2), but uncertainties in geologic and rock-property data prevent definitive conclusion (Grauch and others, 1997).

Western Domain

Southwestern Domain

The western domain (fig. 6) is characterized by relatively moderate to high gravity values (fig. 3), indicating generally elevated pre-Tertiary rocks; low to moderate bulk magnetization (fig. 5); and local, high-amplitude magnetic anomalies (fig. 4). Preliminary models of gravity data indicate that the pre-Tertiary rocks are generally about 1 km below the surface. The gravity highs in the northern part of the area and in the northern Bullfrog Hills (2 and BH compared to fig. 3) indicate shallower depths— less than 500 m below the surface. A depth estimate from magnetotelluric data (Furgerson, 1982) indicates a depth of about 1 km to resistive basement at the northeastern end of Springdale Mountain, the range just northwest of Oasis Mountain (fig. 6).

The southwestern domain (fig. 6) includes Bare Mountain, the Funeral Mountains, and the intervening Amargosa Valley (BA, FU, AV, fig. 7). The high to very high gravity values characteristic of the domain reflect near-surface and exposed Paleozoic and Precambrian sedimentary and metamorphic rocks. At Bare Mountain, the pre-Tertiary rocks are considered to be the exhumed lower plate (i.e., footwall) of the Fluorspar CanyonBullfrog Hills detachment fault (Maldonado, 1990; Hoisch and others, 1997), which is generally located along the northern boundary of the domain. Within the study area in the Funeral Mountains, the exposed pre-Tertiary rocks represent thin, upper-plate rocks above the Boundary Canyon detachment fault

Figure 7 (facing page). Outlines of interpreted subsurface features to be used as an overlay to figures 3 and 4. The lettered codes are keyed to table 3; the numbered ones to table 4. The numbered labels are circled when referring to a feature other than a fault. The line types for classes of features are generally as follows: domain boundary, thick solid line where well-defined, thick dashed line where poorly defined; inferred faults, medium-thickness solid line where well defined, medium-thick dashed line where poorly defined; caldera topographic walls, thick dash-dot-dot line where well defined, thick short-dash line where poorly defined; caldera structural margins, medium-thick dash-dot-dot line; basins, thin solid line; other features, thin dashed line. The small rectangles in the northern and central parts of the figure show the areas of figures 8 and 10, respectively.

(Wright and Troxel, 1993). The two areas are grouped here as one domain because of their similarity in geophysical character. The high gravity values associated with Bare Mountain (BA compared to fig. 3) extend north of the domain boundary and the Fluorspar Canyon-Bullfrog Hills detachment fault, reflecting the moderate to shallow dip of the fault to the north and northwest.
Low magnetic values throughout the domain and over most of Amargosa Valley (AV compared to fig. 3) indicate a general absence of volcanic rocks. One exception is the large positive magnetic anomaly on the Funeral Mountains side of the Amargosa Valley, of undetermined origin (9 compared to fig. 3).

in the center of the caldera corresponds to a thick (>500 m) sequence of the positive-

inclination, mafic, Trachyte of Hidden Cliff (Tth, table 2). The higher densities expected

for this mafic sequence compared to surrounding units can partially explain the circular

gravity high associated with the caldera, but cannot account for its broad lateral extent.

Therefore an underlying intrusion is inferred. Grauch and others (1997) argue that the

caldera fill on the west side is probably thin, because evidence suggests the magnetic

anomalies crossing the western topographic margin have sources that are shallow and

older than the caldera.

has been proposed as (1) a stepped normal fault, with most of the throw near the

(Langenheim, in press). From gravity modeling, all three models are viable, but the

magnetic and seismic-reflection data support the stepped normal fault model

(Langenheim, in press; Brocher and others, 1996). Snyder and Carr (1984) and Carr

(1988) proposed that this fault was related to a Crater Flat caldera.

A linear discontinuity marked by abrupt differences in magnetic character or by linear positive anomalies. It has only subtle gravity expression (Kane and others, 1981). The change in magnetic character is probably due primarily to the juxtaposition of magnetic rocks having different magnetization directions within the top 1 km of the surface (Grauch and others, 1997). However, it is unclear which units are juxtaposed, especially on the western and eastern ends of the lineament where

sources are buried. The linearity of the feature suggests it has a structural origin; the

coincidence with the topographic wall of the Rainier Mesa caldera in the central part

suggests that it is related in some way to caldera structures.

Possible intrusion or unknown magnetic volcanic source below central Crater Flat.

Broad magnetic high in central Crater Flat could be thick volcanic units at depth (Kane and Bracken, 1983). Connor and others (1997) suggested the presenced of a buried volcano. Carr (1984; 1988) used the magnetic high as evidence of thick volcanic units composing a resurgent dome, interpreted as the Crater Flat caldera. However, magnetic models (Langenheim and Ponce, 1995) indicate that these units, which were encountered in drilling, can only be expected to account for part of the

anomaly; a more likely explanation is a granitic intrusion in pre-Tertiary rocks

within the basin floor (Langenheim, in press). The low gravity and bulk

magnetization values argue against a large, intra-basin intrusion (figs. 3 and 5).

However, drilling at northern Yucca Mountain has not discovered such a major fault within the post-14-Ma volcanic section.

Figure 9. Simple magnetic profile model demonstrating possible sources of the regional magnetic high northeast of Black Mountain. The location of profile ^-^'is shown on figure 8. The bold lines and dots are calculated and observed at 122m above ground; the thin line and plusses are calculated and observed 1,122 m above ground. Total magnetizations assigned to the models are modified slightly from measured values (M. Hudson, unpub. data, 1996) in order to better fit the data. Declination/inclination and intensity (A/m) of total magnetization for tuff of Tolicha Peak (Tqt) = 24°/46° and 2.15; for Rainier Mesa Tuff (Tmr) = 157°/-32° and 1.08; for the shallower body of dacite lava of Mt. Helen (Tqm) = 357°/58° and 0.9; and for the deeper body 15°/62° and 0.5. The deeper body is assigned a lower remanent magnetization, likely due to its depth (McElhinny, 1973). For simplicity, the gray area (undetermined country rock) of the model has zero magnetization. Near the caldera margin, viable models require either thickening of the modeled Rainier Mesa Tuff (Tmr), changes in magnetization, or variations in other rock units in this area. However, only the model involving thickening of Tmr is shown.

Southern Domain
The southern domain (fig. 6) is one of the most extensively studied parts of the map area because it includes Yucca Mountain, site of the DOE-proposed high-level-nuclear-waste facility. Many previous workers have discussed geologic and geophysical studies in this area, which are too numerous to review in this paper. The domain is generally characterized by a moderate magnitude of extension, moderate magmatism (several to tens of km3/m.y. extruded during the middle to late Miocene), and by a mixture of structural styles. Geophysically, this domain has low bulk magnetization (fig. 5), numerous moderately high amplitude magnetic anomalies (fig. 4), and variable gravity values (fig. 3).
The boundary between the southern and Timber Mountain domains in the northern part of Crater Flat is expressed by a subtle change in gravity values (fig. 3) and by abrupt changes in magnetic patterns (fig. 4). This boundary has also been recognized by previous workers as the southern limit of a broad, regional, east-trending magnetic high (e.g., Bath and Jahren, 1984; Oliver, Ponce, and Blank, 1995). However, the magnetic potential map indicates the southern limit of high bulk magnetization is actually about 10 km farther north (fig. 5). No evidence of this domain boundary is observed in surface geology nor in

changes of thickness of pre-14-Ma rocks in the subsurface (Fridrich, 1999; Fridrich, Dudley, and Stuckless, 1994).
The origin of the broad, regional, east-trending magnetic high has been the subject of interest and debate because it extends across the northern part of Yucca Mountain and coincides with a hydraulic gradient (Fridrich, Dudley, and Stuckless, 1994). In the area of the Calico Hills (CH, fig. 7), argillite in the Eleana Formation has a unique magnetic expression that allows it to be distinguished from the carbonate units, whereas it cannot be distinguished from the carbonate units with gravity data, nor does it have a magnetic signature elsewhere. This unique magnetic signature prompted speculation that the western extension of the broad, regional magnetic high is caused by a subsurface extension of the magnetized Eleana unit (CH compared to fig. 4) (Bath and Jahren, 1984). The presence of the Eleana confining unit north of Yucca Mountain could also explain the hydraulic gradient (Fridrich, Dudley, and Stuckless, 1994). However, the magnetic source of the regional high is estimated at 1.5- to 3.0-km depth (Ponce and others, 1995; Oliver, Ponce, and Blank, 1995). At the depths indicated, a large volume of magnetic material is required to explain the magnetic high. Therefore, a granitic intrusion or batholith is more likely to be the primary source, perhaps with some contribution from magnetized argillite (Kane and Bracken, 1983; Carr and others, 1986; Oliver, Ponce, and Blank, 1995).

Figure 10. Geologic map of Oasis Valley basin area (map area shown by rectangle on fig. 7) generalized from Sawyer and others (1995). Also shown are Oasis Valley discharge area ("v" pattern), geophysical features from figure 7, and the location of and schematic stratigraphic section drilled in MYJO Coffer #1 well (R. Warren and D. Sawyer, written commun., 1992). Unshaded areas represent Quaternary alluvium and Tertiary gravels (QTa). Shaded areas are geologic units and groups from table 2: younger Tertiary basalts (Tb), Thirsty Canyon group (Tt), upper Fortymile rhyolite lavas (Tfu), Beatty Wash Formation (Tfb), rhyolite of Fleur-de-lis Ranch (Tff), Ammonia Tanks Tuff (Tma), Rainier Mesa Tuff (Tmr), Paintbrush group (Tp), Tram Tuff (Tct), and Belted Range group (Tb). Shaded areas also include units from Sawyer and others (1995) within the volcanics of Fortymile Canyon (Tf) and the Crater Flat group (Tc) that are not listed in table 2.

Eastern Domain
Another well studied area is the eastern domain (fig. 6), which locally was intensively drilled and investigated in studies associated with underground nuclear-weapons testing in Yucca Flat. The domain is characterized by late Miocene normal faulting and limited Tertiary magmatism. The eastern domain is more typical of basin-and-range structure than other parts of the study area, and the wealth of subsurface information, especially in Yucca Flat, provides an excellent model for this structural style elsewhere in the Great Basin. The style is evident in the gravity map (fig. 3), as shown by paired, north-trending highs and lows. The lows (MV, YF, WY, CB, and FF compared to fig. 3) are caused by alluvial basins filled with Miocene-Quaternary alluvium and underlain by distal tuffs erupted from the southwestern Nevada

volcanic field. The gravity highs (ER, HR, and the area between YF and WY compared to fig. 3) reflect near-surface pre-Tertiary rocks. None of the relief on the pre-Tertiary sedimentary surface can be attributed to caldera tectonism.
The boundary of the Timber Mountain and eastern domains coincides with the interface between pre-caldera rocks on the east and caldera-related rocks on the west within the upper 3 km of crust. Thus, the boundary was drawn to include the inferred Gold Meadows stock at depth (GM, fig. 7) within the eastern domain. This stock, like the nearby Climax stock (CL, fig. 7) and some other small plutons not shown, is of Mesozoic age and therefore predates the main stage of volcanism. This western boundary of the eastern domain generally corresponds to the principal ground-water divide in the Nevada Test Site region (fig. 2), which separates the regional carbonate aquifer

systems to the east from the regional volcanic aquifer systems to the west (Laczniak and others, 1996). The boundary of the eastern domain with the southern domain is gradational and does not correspond to any known structure. It generally marks a pronounced change in structural and magmatic style and values of bulk magnetization (fig. 5).

drilling (Fridrich, Dudley, and Stuckless, 1994), as discussed previously in the section on the southern domain.
Hydrogeologic Implications West of the Nevada Test Site

Southeastern Domain
The southeastern domain (fig. 6) includes structural styles and characteristic geophysical signatures that can be continued farther to the southeast of the study area to the Spring Mountains (fig. 1). The region is amagmatic, as evidenced by a subdued magnetic character (Blakely, 1988), and it is characterized by strike-slip faulting (Hudson, 1997). The high gravity values reflect structurally high pre-Tertiary sedimentary rocks (SP and SR, fig. 7), overlain locally by Cenozoic alluvium. The northern boundary of this domain is the Rock Valley fault zone (RV, fig. 7), which is an oblique, down-to-the-northwest fault zone (Burchfiel, 1965; O'Leary, in press).
Hydrogeologic Implications
The geophysical framework of interpreted, major geologic features (fig. 7, tables 3 and 4) provides constraints for understanding the geologic and hydrogeologic framework of the subsurface in the southwestern Nevada volcanic field and vicinity, especially where drill-hole control on subsurface geology is limited. Many of the geophysical features show evidence of major lateral changes in the physical properties of the crust that extend to depths of 1 km or greater. No matter what their geologic origin, these geophysical features remain as evidence of major changes in the nature of the subsurface that may be significant to the hydrogeology of the area.
Regional Hydrologic and Geophysical Features
Within the southwestern Nevada volcanic field, the change from volcanic aquifers to carbonate aquifers to the east and south corresponds to a steep hydraulic gradient (fig. 2) and the presence of the Eleana confining unit (Fridrich, Dudley, and Stuckless, 1994; Laczniak and others, 1996). This change is expressed geophysically primarily by a major change in gravity values between the Timber Mountain and eastern domains (compare figs. 3 and 6) and, secondarily, by a change in magnetic character (fig. 4). The gravity expression is related to the difference in subsurface densities between the volcanic rocks and pre-Tertiary sedimentary rocks in the subsurface.
The same gravity gradient continues to the south and west, generally defining the boundary between the Timber Mountain and southern domains (compare figs. 3 and 6). The gravity gradient also coincides with the regional magnetic gradient that corresponds to a change in water level seen in subsurface

West of the Nevada Test Site, where drill-hole information is lacking, geophysical data provide the best information available about the subsurface hydrogeology. Interpretations of such data constrain the bulk physical properties of the subsurface from which hydrogeologic units have been inferred (fig. 11). The inferences are intended to help focus further work, not to redefine regional ground-water concepts.
Regional ground-water flow is southwestward from the main area of underground testing at Pahute Mesa toward the northern part of the western border of the Nevada Test Site (fig. 11) (Blankenagel and Weir, 1973; O'Hagan and Laczniak, 1996). Figure 11 shows a detail of the area of interest with interpretations and inferred hydrogeologic units that were developed from the geophysical framework. The interpretations are discussed primarily under the section on the Timber Mountain domain. The following geophysical features have hydrogeologic significance (referenced to the labels of figure 7 and tables 3 and 4): (1) the WNW-trending inferred structure (18); (2) the resurgent intrusion associated with the Ammonia Tanks caldera (TM); (3) features near the northwestern margins of the Ammonia Tanks and Rainier Mesa caldera margins (RMT and gravity gradient); (4) the NNE.-trending structures on the west side of the Silent Canyon and limber Mountain caldera complexes (13 and 14); and (5) the Hot Springs and Hogback faults bounding Oasis Valley basin (7 and 24) and the subsurface rocks that are juxtaposed at these faults.
The WNW.-trending inferred structure (18, fig. 7) may in part be related to the topographic wall of the Rainier Mesa caldera (RMT, fig. 7). Along the western part of the structure, where its trend is nearly perpendicular to regional ground-water flow (fig. 11), rocks having significantly different magnetization directions (as opposed to magnetization intensities) are juxtaposed within the top 1 km of crust. Their magnetic signatures are indicative of moderate to strong total magnetization, a signature typically associated with unaltered, welded ash-flow tuffs. The subtle gravity gradient (figs. 8 and 11) indicates only a minor change in bulk density of the crust. Thus, the lithology (but probably not the ages) of units on either side of the structure could be very similar, suggesting that the structure has minor hydrogeologic significance.
The area within which ground water intersects with the resurgent intrusion underneath the Timber Mountain area is approximated by the general outline of the elliptical gravity high (TM compared to fig. 3; fig. 11), as discussed under the section on the Timber Mountain domain. Electrical surveys across the center of Timber Mountain (fig. 11) indicate the intrusion and its volcanic cover have low interstitial and fracture porosities to depths of 1 km (Zablocki, 1979). If this electrical characterization is representative of the resurgent intrusion as a whole, then an extensive barrier to regional ground-water flow from the north of Timber Mountain could be present in the subsurface (fig. 11).

34 Geophysical Framework of the Southwestern Nevada Volcanic Field and Hydrogeologic Implications

Between the inferred WNW.-trending structure and the Timber Mountain resurgent intrusion is a gravity gradient that generally trends east-west near the projected northwestern topographic margin of the Rainier Mesa caldera (fig. 11). The gradient reflects a subtle, but abrupt, change in subsurface density that may be related to differences in rocks across the topographic wall of the Rainier Mesa or Ammonia Tanks calderas, or across the structural margin of the Rainier Mesa or older caldera. From geologic inference, caldera margins should be present in this area, but they are not exposed.
The NNE.-trending structures along the western margins of the major caldera complexes (fig. 11) are probably related to each other and to caldera formation, as discussed previously in the section on the Timber Mountain domain. In particular, the structure that is expressed in the gravity data is coincident with caldera margins (14/SCC compared to fig. 7) and with the waterlevel discontinuity in the northwestern part of the Nevada Test Site (fig. 11), both of which are known from drill-hole data and hydrologic pump tests. Such coincident features suggest that the structure extends to the southwest, where it could also produce water-level discontinuities.
The structures bounding Oasis Valley basin include the inferred north-striking Hogback and east-striking Hot Springs faults (fig. 11) that compose the western boundary of the Timber Mountain domain. The gravity data indicate that the domain boundary here represents the interface between a subsurface composed primarily of pre-Tertiary sedimentary rocks on the west and south and primarily low- to moderate-density Tertiary rocks in Oasis Valley basin (fig. 11). The gravity information alone cannot distinguish pre-Tertiary confining units from carbonate aquifers. However, quartzite exposed near Oasis Mountain (Laczniak and others, 1996) and in the northern Bullfrog Hills (Minor and others, 1997) adds evidence that the preTertiary sedimentary rocks west of the Hogback fault are likely composed mainly of the quartzite confining unit rather than carbonate aquifers. Thus, the Hogback fault probably acts as a barrier to ground water flowing westward from the Timber Mountain domain. No additional evidence on the composition of pre-Tertiary rocks in the shallow subsurface between the Hot Springs fault and Bare Mountain is available. If the pre-Tertiary rocks in this area are composed primarily of confining units, the Hot Springs fault could also represent a barrier. A barrier at the Hot Springs fault could explain the presence of springs along the east side of Oasis Mountain in Oasis Valley discharge area (figs. 6, 11). Ground water flowing southward in Oasis Valley basin might be diverted to the west by the Hot Springs fault and forced up the moderately dipping Hogback fault.
The configuration of the geophysical features that have potential hydrogeologic importance (fig. 11) supports the hypothesis of O'Hagan and Laczniak (1996) and the results of more recent hydrologic modeling (U.S. Department of Energy, 1997) that regional ground-water flow from the area of underground testing at Pahute Mesa follows a path southwestward to Oasis Valley discharge area. In particular, there is no geophysical nor geologic evidence for a significant change in subsurface physical properties within a corridor (shading on fig. 11) extending from the northwestern comer of the Rainier Mesa caldera to Oasis Valley basin.

Selected Series of U.S. Geological Survey Publications

Books and Other Publications
Professional Papers report scientific data and interpretations of lasting scientific interest that cover all facets of USGS investigations and research.
Bulletins contain significant data and interpretations that are of lasting scientific interest but are generally more limited in scope or geographic coverage than Professional Papers.
Water-Supply Papers are comprehensive reports that present significant interpretative results of hydrologic investigations of wide interest to professional geologists, hydrologists, and engineers. The series covers investigations in all phases of hydrology, including hydrogeology, availability of water, quality of water, and use of water.
Circulars are reports of programmatic or scientific information of an ephemeral nature; many present important scientific information of wide popular interest. Circulars are distributed at no cost to the public.
Fact Sheets communicate a wide variety of timely information on USGS programs, projects, and research. They commonly address issues of public interest. Fact Sheets are generally two or four pages long and are distributed at no cost to the public.
Reports in the Digital Data Series (DDS) distribute large amounts of data through digital media, including compact disc read-only memory (CD-ROM). They are high-quality, interpretative publications designed as self-contained packages for viewing and interpreting data and typically contain data sets, software to view the data, and explanatory text.
Water-Resources Investigations Reports are papers of an interpretative nature made available to the public outside the formal USGS publications series. Copies are produced on request (unlike formal USGS publications) and are also available for public inspection at depositories indicated in USGS catalogs.
Open-File Reports can consist of basic data, preliminary reports, and a wide range of scientific documents on USGS investigations. Open-File Reports are designed for fast release and are available for public consultation at depositories.
Maps
Geologic Quadrangle Maps (GQ's) are multicolor geologic maps on topographic bases in 7.5- or 15-minute quadrangle formats (scales mainly 1:24,000 or 1:62,500) showing bedrock, surficial, or engineering geology. Maps generally include brief texts; some maps include structure and columnar sections only.
Geophysical Investigations Maps (GP's) are on topographic or planimetric bases at various scales. They show results of geophysical investigations using gravity, magnetic, seismic, or radioactivity surveys, which provide data on subsurface structures that are of economic or geologic significance.

Miscellaneous Investigations Series Maps or Geologic Investigations Series (I's) are on planimetric or topographic bases at various scales; they present a wide variety of format and subject matter. The series also includes 7.5-minute quadrangle photogeologic maps on planimetric bases and planetary maps.
Information Periodicals
Metal Industry Indicators (Mil's) is a free monthly newsletter that analyzes and forecasts the economic health of five metal industries with composite leading and coincident indexes: primary metals, steel, copper, primary and secondary aluminum, and aluminum mill products.
Mineral Industry Surveys (MIS's) are free periodic statistical and economic reports designed to provide timely statistical data on production, distribution, stocks, and consumption of significant mineral commodities. The surveys are issued monthly, quarterly, annually, or at other regular intervals, depending on the need for current data. The MIS's are published by commodity as well as by State. A series of international MIS's is also available.
Published on an annual basis, Mineral Commodity Summaries is the earliest Government publication to furnish estimates covering nonfuel mineral industry data. Data sheets contain information on the domestic industry structure, Government programs, tariffs, and 5-year salient statistics for more than 90 individual minerals and materials.
The Minerals Yearbook discusses the performance of the worldwide minerals and materials industry during a calendar year, and it provides background information to assist in interpreting that performance. The Minerals Yearbook consists of three volumes. Volume I, Metals and Minerals, contains chapters about virtually all metallic and industrial mineral commodities important to the U.S. economy. Volume II, Area Reports: Domestic, contains a chapter on the minerals industry of each of the 50 States and Puerto Rico and the Administered Islands. Volume III, Area Reports: International, is published as four separate reports. These reports collectively contain the latest available mineral data on more than 190 foreign countries and discuss the importance of minerals to the economies of these nations and the United States.
Permanent Catalogs
"Publications of the U.S. Geological Survey, 1879-1961" and "Publications of the U.S. Geological Survey, 19621970" are available in paperback book form and as a set of microfiche.
"Publications of the U.S. Geological Survey, 1971-1981" is available in paperback book form (two volumes, publications listing and index) and as a set of microfiche.
Annual supplements for 1982, 1983, 1984, 1985, 1986, and subsequent years are available in paperback book form.
