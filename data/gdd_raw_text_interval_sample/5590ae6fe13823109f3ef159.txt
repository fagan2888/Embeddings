By Kristin D. Evenson

ABSTRACT

The population of the Soledad basin is

expected to increase by about 140 per-

cent by the year 2000, and with this

increase the demand for fresh water also

will grow.

Land uses are divided

between urban development in the south

and agriculture in the north. Imported

water is the sole water supply in the

southern part of the basin, and ground

water is the sole water supply in the

northern part. Concentrations of dis-

solved solids in ground water range

from 1,000 to 2,000 milligrams per liter,

exceeding local basin objectives. Con-

centrations of chloride, sulfate, and

iron also commonly exceed basin objec-

tives.

Planned uses for reclaimed

water include improving ground-water

quality by pumping out the present

highly mineralized water and replacing it

with less mineralized water.

The population and water demand in the Poway basin is expected to increase by the same percentage as the Soledad basin. The Poway basin is a mix of agricultural and urban land uses, and both ground water and imported water constitute the basins' water supply.

Concentrations of dissolved solids in ground water range from 500 to 1,000 milligrams per liter, commonly exceeding basin water-quality objectives. Concentrations of chloride also exceed basin objectives. As of 1985, there were no plans for using reclaimed water in the Poway basin.
The population growth in the Moosa basin is expected to be somewhat less than that of the Soledad and Poway basins, yet an increase of 100 percent by the year 2000 is expected. The Moosa basin is rural and has some agricultural land use. Ground water and imported water supply the basins' water needs. Concentrations of dissolved solids in ground water range from 470 to 1,200 milligrams per liter, commonly exceeding basin water-quality objectives. Concentrations of chloride also commonly exceed basin objectives. As of 1985, use of reclaimed water was planned to irrigate two golf courses in the lower part of the basin. This reclaimed water is less mineralized than the ground water and is expected to improve the quality of the water in the alluvial aquifer.

INTRODUCTION
Background
The population in the San Diego area has almost doubled since 1960. With this increase in population, water demand also has increased. The area has a limited local water supply, and most of its water needs are met by imported water. The Colorado River is the principal water supply for San Diego County. In December 1985, the Central Arizona Project began transporting water from the Colorado River to the central part of Arizona to supplement water supplies (U.S. Geological Survey, 1986, p. 146). The amount of water imported to California from the Colorado River was reduced proportionately. Consequently, less water is available for the San Diego area. Local water agencies are looking for ways to supplement the remaining water supplies.
This report was prepared in cooperation with the California Regional Water Quality Control Board (CRWQCB), San Diego Region. The CRWQCB is in the process of evaluating the suitability for use of reclaimed water in each of the hydrologic subareas for the entire county. Previous reports by the U.S. Geological Survey, in cooperation with the County of San Diego and the California Department of Water Resources, have been published as part of this evaluation. The reports covered the San Dieguito, San Elijo, and San Pasqual hydrologic subareas (Izbicki, 1983) and the Mission, Santee, and Tijuana hydrologic subareas (Izbicki, 1985).
Purpose and Scope
The purposes of this report are (1) to describe the water resources in the the

Soledad, Poway, and Moosa basins; (2) to define past and present beneficial uses of water in each basin; and (3) to evaluate the suitability of these areas for use of reclaimed water. The report summarizes available data on the quantity and quality of ground, surface, imported, and reclaimed water in the study areas, as well as background information on population, land and water use, geology and soils, and precipitation.
Description of Study Areas
San Diego County is located in southwestern California (fig. 1). The County extends about 70 miles north of the California-Mexico border and 60 to 80 miles east of the Pacific Ocean. The Soledad, Poway, and Moosa basins are located in west-central San Diego County (fig. 1). The Soledad and Poway basins make up the northern part of the Los Penasquitos hydrographic subunit; the two basins share a north-south border, and they are within the northern part of the city of San Diego. The Moosa basin is located 15 miles north of the northern edge of the Poway basin.
The study areas have a Mediterraneantype climate, which is typified by warm, dry summers and cool winters (California Department of Water Resources, 1967). Because of coastal fog, humidity is generally high along the coast during the summer but decreases rapidly inland and is generally low throughout most of the study area. Precipitation is generally low and increases inland from less than 10 inches along the coast to 40 inches in the Agua Tibia Mountains. Most of the rain occurs between November and March.

Well-Numbering System
Wells are numbered according to their location in the rectangular system for subdivision of public land. For example, in well number 14S/3W-20L1S, the number and letter preceding the slash indicate the township (T. 14 S.); the number and letter following the slash indicate the range (R. 3 W.); the number following the hyphen indicates the section (sec. 20); the letter following the section number (L) indicates the 40-acre subdivision of the section; the final digit (1) is a serial number for wells in each 40-acre subdivision; and the final letter (S) indicates the San Bernardino base line and meridian. The following diagram shows the location breakdown of well 14S/3W-20L1S.

DATA COLLECTION
Field Methods
A network of existing water wells and surface-water stations was established to collect data on surface- and groundwater quality, water levels, and streamflow in each of the study basins. Criteria used in selection of sites for this network were (1) availability of information on well construction, (2) ease of sampling, (3) site location, and (4) owner's permission. Ground- and surface-water data were collected during autumn 1984 and spring 1985.
Instantaneous streamflow discharge measurements were made by using a current meter (Carter and Davidian, 1968) on streams that had flow greater than 0.5 ft 3 /s. On streams with flow less than 0.5 ft 3 /s, a Parshall flume was used to make the discharge measurements.
Surface-water quality samples were collected with a DH48 suspended sediment sampler, which had been painted with nonmetallic paint and fitted with a Teflon 1 nozzle and silicon gasket to minimize contamination when sampling for metals.
Static ground-water level measurements were made with a graduated steel tape. Ground-water quality samples were collected after the well had been pumped so that at least three times the volume of the casing was removed to insure that the sample was representative of the aquifer. Specific conductance (SC) was measured periodically, and samples were collected after SC had stabilized.
At the time the samples were collected, temperature, SC, pH, and alkalinity were measured. Temperature of the sample was taken with a hand-held thermometer; SC and pH were measured with portable meters; and alkalinity was

determined by the electrometric titration process (Brown and others, 1970, p. 42). To insure quality control, all field measurements were made twice. Samples for cations were acidified to a pH of less than 2, and samples for nutrients were stored in opaque bottles and preserved with mercuric chloride. At each sampling site, water also was processed for shipment to the U.S. Geological Survey Central Laboratory in Arvada, Colorado.
Laboratory Methods
Samples were analyzed by methods outlined by Skougstad and others (1979) for alkalinity, boron, calcium, chloride, fluoride, iron, magnesium, nutrients (ammonia, nitrite, nitrite plus nitrate, organic nitrogen, and orthophosphate), residue on evaporation at 180 °C (degrees Celsius), silica, and sulfate. Percent sodium, sodium adsorption ratio, and the sum of dissolved constituents were calculated. At selected sites, samples were also analyzed for selected trace metals and pesticides by using methods outlined by Skougstad and others (1979) and Wershaw and others (1983).
Limited Availability of Data

The streams in the Poway basin typically have no flow in the summer and autumn. Therefore, no data representative of autumn conditions are available for the Poway basin.

SOLEDAD BASIN

Location

The Soledad basin (fig. 1) is about 55

mi 2 in area and is bordered on the west

by the Pacific Ocean. The eastern bor-

der is about 12 miles inland. Black

Mountain marks the northeastern bound-

ary and the Miramar Naval Air Station

area extends along the southeastern bor-

der (fig. 2).

Los Penasquitos and

Carmel Creeks are the main drainages

in the area (fig. 2). Miramar reser-

voir, a major storage facility containing

water from the Colorado River, is located

in the southern part of the basin, and

Los Penasquitos Lagoon is located at the

mouth of Los Penasquitos Creek in the

northwestern part of the basin (fig. 2).

Two extremes of land use are found in

this basin.

The Mira Mesa-Scripps

Ranch area in the southeast is a dense

urban development, and the Carmel

Valley area in the north is a mixture

of rural farm and undeveloped land

(fig. 2).

The number of wells in use in the Soledad, Poway, and Moosa basins has decreased significantly since the 1960's. Comparison of historic data with data collected in 1984-85 is somewhat limited, because many wells that had been sampled in the 1960's and 1970's were not available for sampling in 1984-85.
Because the ground-water-quality network used existing wells, several areas in each of the basins lacked wells available for sampling or measuring. Most notable of these areas were the northwestern part of the Poway basin, the southern and western parts of the Soledad basin, and the southern part of the Moosa basin.

Population

The 1980 population of the Soledad

basin was 65,390 (San Diego Association

of Governments, written commun., 1985).

Between 1980 and 2000, the population is

expected to increase by 160 percent

(table 1).

The greatest growth is

expected during the 1980's.

As of 1985, the largest population in the Soledad area was in the Mira MesaScripps Ranch area, located in the southern part of the basin (fig. 2). The areas expected to experience the greatest percentage of growth are the adjoining areas to the west, east, and north.

Land Use

Water-Quality Objectives

Undeveloped land occupies the greatest area (31,150 acres) in the Soledad basin. As of the 1980 census, about 20 percent of the available land had been developed for urban use. Development of land has been distributed evenly, and residential and nonresidential areas occupy 54 and 46 percent of the total developed land, respectively (San Diego Association of Governments, written commun., 1984). Dominant land uses in the Soledad area are agricultural, residential, and industrial (fig. 2). The most extensive agricultural area is located in the northern part of the basin in the Carmel and Shaw Valleys. Nurseries and field crops are the dominant agricultural uses in this area. Residential uses are concentrated in the eastern and southern parts of the basin, and industrial uses are concentrated in the western and southern parts of the basin. Table 2 shows the total acreage developed for various land uses as of the 1980 census.
Projections from 1980 to 2000 show an increase in the acreage of developed land (table 2). The total acreage of developed land is expected to increase by 100 percent; specifically, acreage of residential land is expected to increase by 144 percent and acreage of nonresidential land by 66 percent.

The California Water Code, Division 7, Section 13241, requires that each Regional Water Quality Control Board establish water-quality objectives for the water within its jurisdiction (California Regional Water Quality Control Board, San Diego Region, 1975). These objectives are designed to protect beneficial uses and to prevent misuse. These objectives differ from waterquality standards in that they are defined as goals to be achieved to insure specified beneficial uses, whereas water-quality standards are minimum requirements based on technical information needed to insure specified beneficial uses. Therefore, the objectives are at least as strict as the water-quality standards and may be stricter in selected areas. Waterquality standards for selected constituents established by the State of California are given in tables 3 and 4.
Water-quality criteria and the nondegradation policy of the California State Water Resources Control Board are the basis for the water-quality objectives. The nondegradation policy states:
Whenever the existing quality is better than the quality established in policies as of the date on which such policies become effective, such

Soledad Basin 9

The California Office of Technical Coordination has established waterquality objectives for municipal and agricultural supplies, water-contact and noncontact recreation, and fresh and salt-water habitats. These objectives, together with the beneficial uses designated for each basin, were combined to create water-quality objectives for each basin. In this report, beneficial uses are discussed under the subheading of the type of water for each basin.
As the water-quality objectives are based on water use, there are different objectives for the surface and ground water in each basin (tables 5 and 6, respectively). In general, ground water has stricter objectives because it is more often used for domestic purposes than is surface water.
In addition to the standards for the constituents presented in tables 5 and 6, maximum limits for pesticides and trace inorganic chemicals in any water used for domestic or municipal supplies have been established by the State of California (1977) (table 4).
Hydrologic System
Geologic Units and Their Water-Bearing Characteristics
Most of the Soledad basin is underlain primarily by sedimentary rocks consisting of conglomerates, sandstones, and shales. Volcanic rocks underlie part of the basin. Seven geologic units are exposed in this basin (fig. 3). In ascending order, they are Santiago Peak Volcanics, gabbro of Cretaceous age, La Jolla Group, Poway Group, Lindavista Formation, Bay Point Formation, and alluvium (Kennedy, 1975). The Bay Point Formation and gabbro occupy a small part of the area and therefore are not discussed in this section.

and eastern parts of the basin and in

isolated outcrops throughout the rest

of the area. Massive conglomerates,

andesitic

agglomerates,

quartzites,

shales, tuffs, and trachytic and ande-

sitic flows make up the Santiago Peak

Volcanics. These rocks are more resist-

ant to erosion than the overlying

sedimentary rocks.

Drillers' logs indicate that Santiago Peak Volcanics are penetrated by several wells in the basin. These wells also yield water from the overlying sediment of the Poway Group, and so the
water-yielding characteristics of these wells may not be representative of water

yielding characteristics of the Santiago Peak Volcanics. Elsewhere in San Diego County, well yields from the Santiago Peak Volcanics are generally low, usually less than 2 gal/min.
The La Jolla Group of Eocene age extends from the northern to the southern border of the basin; its expanse is broken only by the alluvium of the stream valleys and occurrences of the Lindavista Formation. The La Jolla Group consists, in ascending order, of three formations: the Del Mar Formation, the Torrey Sandstone, and the Friars Formation. The Del Mar Formation is composed of coarse- and fine-grained sandstone and sandy shales. The formation is generally exposed along the coast and up to 1 mile inland. Maximum thickness in the basin is 200 feet. The Torrey Sandstone extends from Los Penasquitos Canyon to the northern border of the subbasin. The formation is a soft, friable, coarse sandstone that overlies the Del Mar Formation. Thickness ranges from 25 to 200 feet. Friars Formation extends from Carmel Valley Canyon to the northern border of the basin. The formation is composed of sandstone and claystone. Maximum thickness in the basin is 150 feet. Ground water has not been developed in the La Jolla Group in the Soledad basin; however, in the San Dieguito basin to the north, wells have been drilled in this unit, and they typically yield water at a rate of 10 to 20 gal/min (Izbicki, 1983). Of this group, the Torrey Sandstone is more transmissive and yields greater amounts of water to wells than the Del Mar Formation (Izbicki, 1983).
The Poway Group of Eocene age is found in the southern part of the basin and extends from Miramar to the eastern edge of the basin. The Poway Group is an erosion-resistant unit composed mostly of conglomerates, although sands, shales, and caliche are often present. Maximum thickness of the Poway Group in the Soledad basin is about 900 feet.

Most of the ground water used in the Soledad basin comes from the Poway Croup. The ground water probably comes from the coarser conglomerates that make up this group, specifically the Stadium Conglomerate and Pomerado Conglomerate (Kennedy and Peterson, 1975). Well yields range from 10 to 75 gal/min; however, typical yields are 10 to 20 gal/min.

South of Los Penasquitos Canyon, extending from Miramar to the ocean, is the Lindavista Formation of Pleistocene Age (fig. 3). In the eastern part of the study area, the Poway Croup Formation is exposed as a broad, gently sloping terrace; in the west, the formation is characterized by narrow terraces separated by steep-walled canyons. The Lindavista Formation consists of an erosion-resistant conglomerate, cemented with iron oxides. These conglomerates form a cap rock for the walls of the stream valleys. The thickness of these deposits usually ranges to 50 feet. This unit is impermeable and generally lies above the water table; therefore, no ground-water development has occurred in this unit in the Soledad basin.

Alluvium, composed of consolidated

stream deposits of silt, sand, and

cobble-sized particles derived from the

surrounding formations, is found in the

Soledad and Carmel Valleys and Los

Penasquitos and Carroll Canyons

(fig. 3). Thickness of the alluvial

fill is greatest in Soledad Valley,

where depths up to 100 feet have been

reported. In the Carmel Valley and

Los Penasquitos and Carroll Canyons,

depths probably do not exceed 25 feet.

In all these valleys, the alluvium thins

out rapidly upstream and eventually

disappears, exposing the underlying

sedimentary rocks.

Soledad Valley

(fig. 3) probably contains the greatest

volume of alluvial fill. This band of

alluvium is about 4 miles long and

0.3 mile wide on the average. In total,

alluvial fill covers about 770 acres.

Maximum thickness of the alluvial fill

is greater than 100 feet; however, near the center of the Soledad Valley; thickness is 30 to 40 feet. This probably represents the average thickness in the valley, as the alluvium thins out to the south and thickens downgradient to the west. There are about 1,176 million ft 3 of alluvial fill in the Soledad Valley.
Carroll and Los Penasquitos Canyons and Carmel Valley all contain much thinner bands of alluvium. The width rarely exceeds 0.25 mile. Although these alluvial aquifers are smaller, they probably contain water with lower concentrations of dissolved solids than that of Soledad Valley. Together, these smaller valleys include about 2,340 acres and contain about 1,529 million ft 3 of alluvial fill. No information on well yields in any of the alluvial aquifers was available. Alluvial fill totals about 2,705 million ft 3 in the Soledad basin.
Of these valleys, the only area in which ground water has been developed is Carmel Valley. Ground water is the primary water supply in this area and supplies enough water for domestic as well as agricultural uses. The alluvial aquifer in this valley contains about 142 million ft 3 of fill. If the average specific yield of Soledad basin is assumed to be 0.1 (Johnson, 1967), ground-water storage, based on October 1984 water-level measurements, is estimated to be 260 acre-ft.
Two wells supply water for domestic uses in the upper part of Los Penasquitos Canyon. One well was flowing at the time of the study, and water in the other stands 1 foot below land surface. The canyon is currently an ecological reserve, and any ground-water development in the near future is unlikely.
In summary, most of the ground water used in the Soledad basin is derived from the Poway Croup; however, alluvium and Santiago Peak Volcanics also contribute water to some wells in the area.

Soils

Soils are an important consideration

when evaluating a site for reclaimed-

water use, as they are the first mate-

rial encountered when water is being

recharged into an underlying aquifer.

Distribution of soils in the San Diego

area is more complex than the geology

since factors that make up soil develop-

ment include vegetation, topography,

climate, living organisms, and time, as

well as geologic parent material. Impor-

tant attributes to consider when contem-

plating reclaimed-water use are soil

thickness, permeability, slope, unusual

chemical reaction, and depth to water.

Eight soil associations (fig. 4) have

been identified in the Soledad basin

(U.S. Soil Conservation Service, 1973):

Redding-Olivenhain, Redding, Diablo-

Linne,

Salinas-Corralitas,

Marina-

Chesterton, Las Flores-Huerhuero,

Exchequer-San Miguel, and a miscella-

neous association of broken land, ter-

race escarpments, and sloping gullied

land (fig. 4).

Redding-Olivenhain and Redding soils have developed over cobbly and gravelly material such as the conglomerates of the Poway Group and the La Jolla Group. These soils cover a large part of the central and southern parts of the basin and lie on dissected terraces at altitudes of 100 to 600 feet. Thickness of these soils ranges from 10 to 60 inches. Degree of slope generally dictates soil thickness; for example, thicker soils are generally found on flatlands and gentle slopes, and thinner soils are found on steep slopes.

Redding soils are well-drained gravelly loams located on 2 to 50 percent slopes. The subsoil of the Redding soils is gravelly, heavy clay loam, and gravelly clay; a layer of cemented hardpan is commonly found below this subsoil. In a typical profile of Redding soils, any one of these layers may be missing. Because of the hardpan, infiltration is slow, less

than 0.06 in/h; where the hardpan is absent, infiltration rates range from 0.63 to 2 in/h (U.S. Soil Conservation Service, 1973).

Olivenhain soils resemble Redding soils in texture, which ranges from cobbly loams to cobbly, sandy loams. The subsoil is cobbly clay, cobbly sandy clay, or cobbly clay loam. Although the Redding and Olivenhain soils share a clayey subsoil, the hardpan layer is absent in the Olivenhain soils. Infiltration rates in this soil are 0.63 to 2 in/h in the surface layer and <0.06 in/h in the subsurface (U.S. Soil Conservation Service, 1973).

Diablo-Linne soils have developed from weathered sandstone and shale. These are generally deep soils located on 2 to 50 percent slopes and altitudes of 100 to 600 feet. These soils are located in the center of the basin. They range in tex-
ture from clay loams to clays. Diablo soils are clays, 20 to 40 inches thick. Infiltration rates are slow, ranging from 0.06 to 0.2 in/h. Linne soils range
from 28 to 40 inches in depth, and infiltration rates range from 0.2 to 0.63 in/h.

Salinas-Corralitas soils develop from

material of marine origin. These soils

are located on the valley floors (fig. 4).

Slopes range from 0 to 15 percent, and

altitudes range from 25 to 300 feet.

Corralitas soils are thick, loamy sands

that have formed from alluvium of marine

sandstones.

Infiltration rates range

from 6.3 to 20 in/h. Salinas soils have

developed on sediments washed off soils

located on the upland slopes, specifically

the Diablo, Linne, Las Flores,

Huerhuero, and Olivenhain.

Salinas

soils are deep clay loams and have a

lower infiltration rate of 0.2 to 0.63 in/h

(U.S. Soil Conservation Service, 1973).

This association contains saline soils; if

reclaimed water is applied to these soils,

the resulting ground water might contain

a greater concentration of dissolved

solids than expected.

Marina-Chesterton soils have developed from iron-rich sand and sandstone. These soils occupy small parts of the north and southwestern parts of the basin. Marina soils are located on old beach ridges on 2 to 30 percent slopes, and subsurface textures are similar, ranging from loam to loamy sand. Infiltration in these soils is rapid, ranging from 6.3 to 20 in/h. Chesterton soils are found on ridge tops on slopes ranging from 2 to 15 percent and are composed of a surface layer of fine sandy
loam to loamy sand that is 10 to 30 percent iron. The surface layer is often underlain by a hardpan layer. Infiltration ranges from 2 to 6.3 in/h in the surface layer and is 0.06 in/h in the hardpan.

Las Flores-Huerhuero soils have devel-
oped over material weathered from marine sediments. They are located in the uplands along the northern and southern edge of the basin on 2 to 30 percent slopes. These soils consist of a deep surface layer of loam to loamy sands with a clayey subsoil. Infiltration ranges from 0.06 to 2 in/h. Las Flores soils are loamy sands with a sandy clay subsoil that have developed from marine sandstone. Huerhuero soils are loams that have developed from sandy marine sediments.

Exchequer-San Miguel soils have devel-

oped from weathered material from

Santiago Peak Volcanics. These soils are

located in the uplands on slopes ranging

from 9 to 70 percent. Rock outcrops are

common, covering about 10 percent of

the area. The surface layer of the

Exchequer-San Miguel soils is silty loam,

8 to 10 inches thick. In the San Miguel

soils, a subsoil of clay about 15 inches

thick is present. This layer is absent

in the Exchequer soils, where the thin

surface layer is underlain with hard

rock.

Infiltration ranges from 0.06

to 2 in/h in the San Miguel soils and

0.63 to 2 in/h in the Exchequer soils.

In summary, areas covered by Exchequer, San Miguel, Las Flores, Huerhuero, Chesterton (where hardpan is present), Salinas, Corralitas, Diablo, Linne, Redding, and Olivenhain are not good sites for ground-water recharge because of low infiltration rates or the saline condition of the soil. Marina are generally good soils for ground-water recharge areas because they are located on gentle slopes, they are deep, and they have infiltration rates ranging from 6.3 to 20 in/h.

Ground Water

Occurrence and movement

Historically, movement of ground water in the small alluvial aquifers has been
downgradient to Soledad Valley (fig. 5). Movement of ground water in Soledad Valley also has been downgradient toward the ocean. Marshy conditions exist up to 2 miles inland from the ocean, and water-level measurements made in 1984-85 in the Soledad Valley show that depth to water is about the same as that measured by Ellis and Lee (1919). At this time, depth to water in these valleys ranged from 2 to 9.5 feet.

Ground-water levels measured in

1984-85 in Carmel Valley were generally

deeper than those in Soledad Valley,

ranging from 7 to 37 feet below land

surface. Ground-water flow in Carmel

Valley is still downgradient toward

Los Penasquitos Lagoon, and water

levels ranged from 5 to 36 feet below

land surface (fig. 5).

In general,

water levels were lower in the summer

and autumn and higher in the spring.

Recharge to the alluvial aquifers of Los Penasquitos and Carroll Canyons and Soledad Valley is by streamflow, precipitation, ground-water flow from the surrounding formations, and municipal

18 Water Resources, Soledad, Poway, and Moosa Basins, San Diego County, Calif.

returns. These sources, as well as irrigation return, also are the sources of recharge to the alluvial aquifer in the Carmel Valley.
Streamflow in the Carmel Valley, which is limited to storm runoff and precipitation, is a minor source of recharge water to the aquifer. Irrigation water is derived solely from local water supplies. No additional water is brought into the area. Some of the water used for irrigation makes its way back to the alluvial aquifer, but most is lost through evapotranspiration, leaving only a small percentage for recharge.

Ground-water quality

Carrol I Canyon and Soledad Valley.

Historical water-quality data available for

well water in Carroll Canyon and Soledad

Valley indicate that water quality has

degraded between 1963 and 1977. In

1963, water from two wells in Carroll

Canyon, 15S/3W-3N1 and 15S/3W-3N2,

had dissolved-solids concentrations of

140 and 660 mg/L (milligrams per liter),

respectively.

At the same time in

Soledad Valley, water in well 15S/3W-6H2

had a dissolved-solids concentration of

830 mg/L. By 1977, the two wells in

Carroll Canyon had been abandoned and

the dissolved-solids concentration of

the well water in Soledad Valley was

1,400 mg/L. By 1984, all wells in

Soledad Valley and Carroll Canyon had

been abandoned.

Los Penasquitos Canyon. Historical water-quality data from two wells located in lower Los Penasquitos Canyon are evidence that water quality in the lower part of the canyon is probably unsuitable for human consumption. Concentrations of dissolved solids in 1963 were 2,200 and 2,100 mg/L, and concentrations of chloride and sulfate ranged from
580 to 590 mg/L and 470 to 580 mg/L, respectively. These wells have been

abandoned, and no current data are

available for this area.

Historical

water-quality data from a well located

in upper Los Penasquitos Canyon,

14S/3W-24J1, indicate that water quality

in the upper part of the canyon is of

better quality than downstream. Analysis

of more current data indicates that the

water quality in this area has remained

unchanged over the past 30 years. Con-

centrations of dissolved solids (residue)

in the water from well 14S/3W-24J1

ranged from 1,500 mg/L (1985) to 1,600

mg/L (1975). This well water also

exceeded basin water-quality objectives

for iron and chloride. From 1974 to

1985, iron values ranged from 0.19 to

0.56 mg/L and averaged 0.41 mg/L.

Chloride concentrations over the same

period ranged from 600 to 730 mg/L and

averaged 650 mg/L.

Another well located about 1 mile upstream had a dissolved-solids concentration of 1,200 mg/L in 1985 and chloride concentration of 470 mg/L; both values were slightly lower than in well 14S/3W-24J1, but at or exceeding basin standards. Iron concentration in well water (0.6 mg/L) also exceeded basin objectives.

Carmel Valley. Historical water-quality data for wells in the Carmel Valley area are available for 1954-63 (California Department of Water Resources, 1967) and 1977 (Michael McCann, California Regional Water Quality Control Board, San Diego Region, written commun., 1985). Well-depth data were unavailable for most of the wells that have water-quality records.

In the samples collected in 1954-63, concentrations of dissolved solids in
these wells ranged from 510 to 6,100 mg/L and averaged 2,000 mg/L (fig. 6). Dissolved-solids concentrations in 40 percent of the wells sampled exceeded the established basin objective of 1,200 mg/L. Chemical water types were generally sodium calcium chloride.

Concentrations of fluoride and boron were below the objectives for the basin. Water from several wells exceeded basin objectives for nitrate concentrations; however, these high concentrations are probably indicative of local conditions, such as agricultural return flow to areas, rather than representative of conditions in the aquifer. One-third of the wells sampled in 1954-63 had water that exceeded the basin objectives for chloride.

In 1977, concentrations of dissolved

solids ranged from 890 to 1,760 mg/L

and averaged 1,360 mg/L. This apparent

lowering of dissolved solids may have

resulted from wells with higher

dissolved-solids concentrations going out

of production, thereby lowering the

range and mean. At this time, 60 per-

cent of the wells sampled contained water

that exceeded 1,200 mg/L of dissolved

solids. Also during this time, several

wells sampled exceeded the basin objec-

tives for both chloride and sulfate. Val-

ues for these two constituents ranged

from 100 to 600 mg/L and from 140 to

580 mg/L, respectively. One well con-

tained water that exceeded basin objec-

tives for fluoride, having a concentration

of 1.1 mg/L.

In samples collected

throughout the 1970's, iron concentra-

tions exceeded basin standards in almost

half the wells sampled; at this time val-

ues ranged from 0.05 to 2.1 mg/L. Con-

centrations for all other constituents

for which basin objectives had been set

were at or below those values.

Most of the wells sampled in 1984-85 contained water in which concentrations of dissolved solids exceeded basin objectives. These concentrations ranged from 1,000 to 2,000 mg/L (fig. 7). Water types were determined mathematically by computing the relative concentration of cations to anions in chemical equivalents. The dominant cation and the dominant anion, those that amount to 50 percent or more of the total, designate the water

type.

If no one cation or anion

amounted to 50 percent of the total,

the water type is designated by the

most dominant anions or cations which

together constitute at least 50 percent

(Hem, 1985). The dominant chemical

water type of the valley has become more

mixed since the early 1960's. On the

basis of samples collected in 1984-85,

the dominant water types were calcium

sodium and chloride sulfate. This addi-

tion of sulfate as a dominant anion also

has led to an increase of wells with sul-

fate values above those established for

basin objectives.

Sulfate concentra-

tions ranged from 280 to 600 mg/L.

Chloride concentrations were at or below

basin objectives throughout the valley,

ranging from 260 to 500 mg/L. Only one

well, 14S/3W-20L1S, had been sampled in

1963, 1977, 1984, and 1985 (fig. 7).

Analysis of these data show the same

trends that were observed. Concen-

trations of dissolved solids have

increased steadily from 790 mg/L in 1963

to 1,070 mg/L in 1985. Concentrations

of chloride and sulfate also have

increased from 180 and 190 mg/L to 320

and 260 mg/L, respectively. Concentra-

tions of iron also tended to be high;

values ranged from 0.29 to 880 mg/L.

Water-quality analyses from 1984-85 are

shown in tables 7 and 8.

Historical data indicate that the quality of ground water in the Poway group is more mineralized than that of the alluvium in the Carmel Valley area. Waterquality data collected in 1962-63 show that concentrations of dissolved solids in water from wells located in the area bordering the Carmel Valley ranged
from 730 to 4,000 mg/L and averaged 2,200 mg/L. Of the wells sampled, 94 percent had concentrations of dissolved solids in excess of 1,200 mg/L; 60 percent exceeded chloride concentrations of 500 mg/L; and one-third exceeded sulfate concentrations of 500 mg/L. As of 1984, most of these wells had been abandoned.

Surface Water
Streamflow characteristics
Los Penasquitos Creek drains the central and southern parts of the Soledad basin; it is currently the only gaged stream in the basin. ' McConigle Canyon drains the northern part of the basin, and Carroll Canyon drains the southern and western parts of the basin (fig. 5). All flow from the basin drains into the ocean through Los Penasquitos Lagoon.

Los Penasquitos Creek connects the

Poway and Soledad basins (fig. 1).

Flow in Los Penasquitos Creek is peren-

nial. Surface runoff in upper McConigle

and Carroll Canyons is confined to peak

flow from major storms. In the lower

reaches of McConigle Canyon, agricul-

tural return flow feeds the stream for

part of the year.

Because Carroll

Canyon drains only urban and industrial

areas, there is no agricultural return to

maintain low flow. Surface-water flow

data are summarized in table 9, and the

location of the gage (10223340) is

shown in figure 5.

Surface-water quality

Water-quality data for Los Penasquitos

Creek near Poway, California, are pre-

sented in table 10. These data were

collected in October 1984 and March 1985

to represent base and storm flows,

respectively. Comparison of the quality

of water during these two periods shows

that the concentration of dissolved solids

is much lower during storm flow than

during base flow. At both times, basin

objectives were exceeded.

Chemical

water types also varied; during base

flow, the water type is sodium chloride;

during storm flow, the water type

becomes mixed. Concentrations of chlor-

ide and sulfate exceeded basin objec-

tives in the fall but not in the spring.

Location of the sampling site is shown

in figure 5.

Concentrations of trace elements were negligible. During the base-flow sampling period, diazinon, a pesticide com-
monly used in households, was detected in Los Penasquitos Creek. The pesticide may have entered the creek in urban runoff upstream.

Reclaimed Water
All municipal wastewater from the Soledad basin is transported to the treatment facility for the city of San Diego and discharged to the ocean off Point Loma (fig. 1). At present, there are no plans from the city of San Diego for use of reclaimed water in the basin. However, the city of Poway, located in the upgradient Poway basin, is considering plans for the use of reclaimed water in the Soledad basin.
Reclaimed water from the city of Poway would be transported into the Soledad basin to be used as recharge water for an alluvial aquifer. This anticipated reclaimed water would be less mineralized than the local ground water in the basin it would recharge. The plans call for pumping the ground water out of the aquifer and replacing it with reclaimed water, thereby improving the quality of the ground water. The plans anticipate that this recharged ground water can be used for irrigation. These plans are still in a preliminary stage, and the specific area of the Soledad groundwater basin to be used for this recharge has not been selected yet.

32 Water Resources, Soledad, Poway, and Moosa Basins, San Diego County, Calif.

Several of the alluvial aquifers may be good candidates for this program. The Carmel Valley has the greatest demand for irrigation water; however, the alluvial aquifer may contribute water to some wells in the valley used for domestic supplies. At present, ground water in the lower part of Los Penasquitos Canyon, as well as in Soledad Valley, is unused. An irrigation supply could be used for roadside and ornamental vegetation and possibly for industry near and in these areas.

Imported Water

Sources and quantity

Imported water in the Soledad basin

is supplied by the city of San Diego.

The water is purchased from the San

Diego County Water Authority, which

purchases it from the Metropolitan

Water District. The water purchased

from the Metropolitan Water District

is a blend of water from the California

State Water Project in the northern

part of the state and water from the

Colorado River. The city of San Diego

further blends this water with local

surface water from various parts of

San Diego County.

Local rain also

contributes a small percentage of

the water supplied to the Soledad

basin.

The resulting water supply

generally is 70 percent imported water

and 30 percent local water. This pro-

portion varies, depending on rainfall

and water demands in different areas

of California.

The municipal water supply for the Soledad basin is stored in Miramar Reservoir and treated at the Miramar filtration plant (fig. 5). Imported water is the sole water supply for most of the basin.

Quality of Imported Water
Water-quality data from the Miramar filtration plant for the period July 1982 to July 1984 are summarized in table 11. In general, the quality of the imported water is considerably less mineralized than that of the local ground water in the Soledad basin. Concentrations of dissolved solids are much lower in the imported water, ranging from 400 to 740 mg/L (Mary H. Middendorf, city of San Diego Utilities Department, written commun., 1985). Chemical water type of the imported water also differs from that of the ground water. Although the chemical water type of the imported water changes periodically, it is generally sodium chloride sulfate.
Water Use
Historically, ground water was an important source of water in the Carmel and Soledad Valleys and Carroll Canyon. Ground water has never been used outside these areas in the Soledad basin, specifically in the southern and eastern parts, where most of the population is located. In 1984-85, ground water was used only in the Carmel Valley, where it was the sole water supply. Imported water was used exclusively throughout the rest of the basin. Surface water has not been developed for use in the basin because flows are intermittent.
The California Regional Water Quality Control Board, San Diego Region (1979), noted existing and potential beneficial uses of surface and ground water for the Soledad basin. During the summer of 1984, the U.S. Geological Survey conducted a field survey of water use in the basin. These uses generally concur with those listed in the 1978 amendments. Specific applications of the various water supplies are discussed in detail under their specific headings.

As population and acreage of developed lands increase, water demand also will increase. Projections from 1980 to 2000 for the entire Los Penasquitos basin

estimate an increase of about 100 per-

cent in the demand for water (California

Regional Water Quality Control Board,

San Diego Region, 1975).

Of this

demand, agricultural water supply is

expected to decrease by about 85 per-

cent while other water uses, specifi-

cally domestic, commercial, and indus-

trial, are expected to increase by

about 90 percent. These projections

are for the entire Los Penasquitos

basin, which includes the Soledad,

Poway, Scripps, Miramar, and Tecolote

basins. Because of similarities among

these basins, the trends and percent-

age of changes probably are extrap-

olated accurately to the Soledad basin.

Ground Water
As of 1985, ground water was used only in and around the Carmel Valley. In this area, ground water is the sole water supply and is used for agriculture, industry, and domestic purposes. Most of the water in the Carmel Valley, however, is not well suited for irrigation supplies. According to the U.S. Salinity Laboratory's (1954) system of

36 Water Resources, Soledad, Poway, and Moosa Basins, San Diego County, Calif.

classification of water as to its suitability for irrigation, most of the water in wells sampled in the Carmel Valley are rated medium on sodium hazard and very high on salinity hazard.
Irrigation water probably accounts for the largest water use in this area. Total irrigation-water demand was about 10,120 acre-ft/yr in the Carmel Valley in 1980 (California Region Water Quality Control Board, San Diego Region, 1975). Irrigation water probably accounts for the largest water use in this area. Population in the Carmel Valley area is low; the amount of water used for domestic and industrial purposes probably does not exceed 100 acre-ft/yr.
As long as the Carmel Valley remains largely agricultural, ground water can probably supply the area's water needs. However, if the quality of the ground water continues to deteriorate, the ground water could become unusable for both agricultural and domestic purposes. If urban expansion extends into the area, imported water could be brought in to supplement that part of the water supply.

Surface Water

Surface water in the Soledad basin is

intermittent and, therefore, not a

dependable supply. Consequently, sur-

face water generally is not used as a

water-supply source. The beneficial

uses associated with surface water are

noncontact recreation, agriculture, and

fish and wildlife habitat.

Surface

water in the Soledad basin also has the

potential for industrial use.

Imported Water

In the Soledad basin, imported water
is used for indoor and outdoor municipal purposes as well as for industry. Percapita water production in the basin is 0.18 acre-ft/yr (California Regional Water Quality Control Board, San Diego Region, 1975). To supply the population of the basin (65,390 in 1980) (table 1), an additional water supply of about 11,770 acre-ft/yr is needed. This estimate does not include the amount of water needed for irrigation or for industry, which varies widely depending on the requirements of the particular industry; therefore, the total demand is actually greater.

Soledad Basin 37

POWAY BASIN
Location
The Poway basin adjoins the eastern border of the Soledad basin (fig. 1) and covers about 41 mi 2 . The city of Poway lies in the center of the Poway basin (fig. 1). Rolling hills separate Poway basin from the Soledad basin, and steep hillsides form the eastern edge of the basin. To the northwest of Poway, high-density housing is becoming the dominant land use; however, most of the Poway area in 1985 was urban-rural: low-density residential, light industry, and agriculture. Poway, Beeler, and Rattlesnake Creeks are the main drainages in the area (fig. 8).
Population
The population of the Poway basin, which was 33,520 in 1980 (San Diego Association of Governments, written commun., 1985), is expected to increase about 140 percent by the year 2000. The greatest increase is expected in the 1980's. Table 12 shows projected populations from 1980 to 2000.
Currently, the main population center is the city of Poway (fig. 1). From 1980 to 2000, the population of the city is expected to increase 46 percent. The largest increase in population is expected in the areas north and west of Poway. The rugged terrain to the east will probably curtail growth in that direction.
Land Use
The Poway basin contains about 22,200 acres. The 1980 census indicates that about 25 percent of the total acreage was developed in 1980 (San Diego Association of Governments, 1984). Of this, 80 percent was residential development and

20 percent was nonresidential. Agriculture occupies the largest amount of land developed for nonresidential uses (fig. 8).
Projections to 2000 show sharp increases in the acreage of developed land. Acreage of residential development is expected to increase more than 90 percent, and acreage of nonresidential development is expected to increase almost 120 percent. Table 13 shows projections of acreage under specific land uses from 1980 to 2000.
Undeveloped land occupies the greatest acreage in the Poway area. In the eastern part of the basin, the undeveloped land is rugged, steeply sloping terrain, but in the western part, the undeveloped land is generally gently rolling terrain. The western part of the study area is expected to undergo the greatest development, and the eastern part is expected to undergo little development.
Residential and agricultural land uses are dominant in the Poway basin. Residential lands are concentrated near the center of the basin in and around the city of Poway. Agricultural lands are located in the western and northern parts of the basin. Commercial and recreational lands and schools occupy a small percentage of land in the basin (fig. 8).
Water-Quality Objectives
The establishment of and rationale for water-quality objectives have been described in the discussion of the Soledad basin. The same criteria for the establishment of water-quality objectives apply in the Poway basin. Waterquality objectives for surface and ground water in the Poway basin are found in tables 14 and 15, respectively. In addition to the objectives

38 Water Resources, Soledad, Poway, and Moosa Basins, San Diego County, Calif.

presented in table 14, the domestic use of ground water warrants the application of requirements of the State of California (1977) (tables 3 and 4).
Hydrologic System
Geologic Units and their Water-Bearing Characteristics
The six geologic units exposed in the Poway basin are, in ascending order, the Santiago Peak Volcanics, the Lusardi Formation of the Rosario Croup of Late Cretaceous age, granitic rocks of the southern California batholith, the Friars Formation of the La Jolla Croup, the Poway Croup, and alluvium (fig. 9).
The Santiago Peak Volcanics are the oldest rocks in the basin (fig. 9). They are most commonly found in the western part of the study area; however, isolated outcrops also occur in the eastern part of the basin. These volcanics, which have been described in detail in the discussion of the Soledad basin, are extremely resistant to erosion, and they form the elevated ridge between the Poway and Soledad subunits. The volcanics yield small quantities of water to wells from cracks and fissures, but in the Poway basin no wells have been drilled into them.
The occurrence of the Lusardi Formation is limited to several small outcrops in the eastern part of the basin (fig. 9). These rocks are cobble and boulder conglomerates occasionally containing lenses of sandstone (Kennedy and Peterson, 1975).
Granitic rocks of the southern California batholith are exposed in or underlie the north and east parts of the basin (fig. 9). These rocks are quartz diorite, gabbro, and tonalites. Tonalites can be deeply weathered, and wells drilled in weathered tonalites can produce high yields; wells drilled in the more resistant diorites and gabbros generally have low yields.

The Friars Formation of the La Jolla Croup, a nonmarine lagoonal sandstone and claystone, is exposed along the southern side of Poway Valley and Los Penasquitos Canyon (fig. 9). The formation is also found adjacent to the east and west sides of the alluvium around
Beeler Creek and around the outcrop of the Poway Croup in the northern part of the basin. This formation also underlies sedimentary deposits throughout the area. The maximum thickness in the basin is about 150 feet. Because this formation is located in areas that are unpopulated, it has not been developed as a source of ground water in the Poway basin. The La Jolla Croup typically yields small quantities of water to wells elsewhere in San Diego County (Izbicki, 1983; 1985).

The Poway Croup forms the south wall

of the Poway Valley and extends

throughout the southern part of the

basin (fig. 9). Isolated occurrences

also are located north of Poway Creek

and west of Rattlesnake Creek. This

group is composed of the Stadium

Conglomerate, the Mission Valley For-

mation, and the Pomerado Conglomerate

(Kennedy and Peterson, 1975). The

Stadium and Pomerado Conglomerates are

lithologically similar.

Both consist

of a cobble conglomerate that has a

coarse-grained sandstone matrix, and

lenses of sandstone compose as much as

50 percent of the units. The Stadium

Conglomerate is the lowermost formation

and the Pomerado Conglomerate is the

uppermost formation in the Poway Croup.

The Mission Valley Formation lies

between the two. This formation is com-

posed of marine, lagoonal, and nonmarine

sandstone. The sandstone is soft and

locally contains carbonate-cemented beds

(Kennedy and Peterson, 1975). Drillers'

logs indicate that the Poway Group is

a source of water to wells in the Poway

basin. Well depth in this unit ranges

from 100 to 200 feet. These wells prob-

ably derive water from the coarser parts

of the Stadium and Pomerado Conglom-

erates. Well yields range from 2 to

30 gal/min in the Poway Croup.

Alluvium covers about 4.7 mi 2 in the Poway basin (fig. 9). This alluvium is composed of unconsolidated stream deposits of silt, sand, and cobble-sized particles derived from surrounding for-
mations (Kennedy and Peterson, 1975). The largest deposit of alluvium is located in the center of the basin along the Poway Valley. This alluvium-covered area is about 4 miles long and ranges in width from 0.5 to 1 mile. Three other minor occurrences of alluvium are found in the basin, one extending along Beeler
Creek south of the main valley, one extending along Pomerado Creek and one along Chicarita Creek to the north of the valley. Thickness of alluvium in the

Phosphorus concentrations not to exceed 0.1 mg/L in flowing water and 0.025 mg/L in standing bodies of water. Values for nitrogen compounds have not been established; however, natural ratios of nitrogen to phosphorus are to be determined by surveillance and upheld. Where data are lacking, a ratio of N>P =10:1 shall be used (California Regional Water Quality Control Board, San Diego Region, 1979).

Poway valley varies. The maximum thickness averages about 40 feet and probably does not exceed 75 feet. The thickness of alluvial fill in the minor valleys probably does not exceed 10 feet. Where the deposits are thick enough, wells obtain water from the alluvium. Groundwater yields are low in the alluvial aquifer; some wells yield enough water
for domestic uses, but not enough for irrigation.

In summary, the major sources of ground water in the Poway basin are granitic rocks, the Poway Croup, and alluvium.

Soils

Seven soil associations are present in

the Poway basin (fig. 10): Redding-

Olivenhain, Exchequer-San Miguel,

Ramona-Placentia,

Friant-Escondido,

Cieneba-Fallbrook, Fallbrook-Vista, and

Diablo-Altamont (U.S. Soil Conservation

Service, 1973).

The Redding-Olivenhain and Exchequer
San Miguel associations (fig. 10) overlie the conglomerate of the Poway (Jroup and Santiago Peak Volcanics, respectively. These soils (described

previously in the "Soils" section of

the discussion of Soledad basin) tend

to be thin, commonly containing a clay

or hardpan layer that makes infiltra-

tion slow.

Redding-Olivenhain and

Exchequer-San Miguel are generally not

good soils for reclaimed-water recharge

areas.

Ramona-Placentia soils are located on the floor of the Poway Valley (fig. 10). These soils are sandy loams that have formed from granitic alluvium. Slopes are from 0 to 9 percent, and soils are from 28 to 80 inches deep. The surface layer of the Ramona soils ranges from
sandy loam to coarse sandy loam, and it is underlain by a subsoil that ranges from sandy-clay loam to clay loam. Infiltration ranges from 2 to 6.3 in/h. Placentia soils have a surface layer of sandy loam and a subsoil that ranges from clay to clay loam in texture. Infiltration is 2 to 6.3 in/h in the surface soil and 0.06 in/h in the subsoil.

Friant-Escondido soils (fig. 10), which are found on the east side of the Poway basin, have developed from metasedimentary rock. These thin sandy loams, which are often eroded, occupy upland slopes. Friant soils range from very fine sandy loams to sandy loams. These
soils are usually thin, 3 to 15 inches, and are located on steep slopes, 9 to 70 percent. Infiltration is moderate, 2 to 6.3 in/h. Escondido soils are generally thicker than Friant soils, ranging in depth from 20 to 40 inches. These soils have a surface layer that ranges from fine sandy loam to silt loam in texture and is underlain by a subsurface
layer of similar texture. Infiltration ranges from 0.63 to 2 in/h.

Cieneba-Fallbrook soils (fig. 10) develop from material weathered from granitic rocks. These soils are found in the hills between 200 and 3,000 teet and are usually thin, ranging from 10 to 24 inches in thickness. This association is
rocky, and rock outcrops are common over some of the area. Cieneba soils are located on slopes ranging from 9 to 75 percent.

These soils have a surface layer ranging from coarse sandy loam to sandy loam, underlain by decomposed granite. Infiltration rates are 6.3 to 20 in/h. The surface layer of the Fallbrook soils is similar to that of the Cieneba; these soils, however, are underlain by a subsoil that has a sandy-clay loam texture, which makes infiltration rates slower than those of the Cieneba soils. The infiltration in these soils ranges from 0.63 to 2.0 in/h.
Fallbrook-Vista soils (fig. 10) also have developed from weathered granitic rocks and are found at altitudes of 200 to 3,000 feet. These soils are located in the north central part of the basin. Rock outcrops also are common in this association. These soils tend to be thicker than the Cieneba-Fallbrook, ranging from 20 to 57 inches. Infiltration ranges from 2 to 6.3 in/h. Fallbrook soils have been described previously. Vista soils have a surface layer of coarse sandy loams and a subsurface layer of sandy loam.
Diablo-Altamont soils (fig. 10) are found in the uplands in the northwestern part of the basin on 2 to 30 percent slopes. These soils are clays, generally 20 to 37 inches thick, that have formed over calcareous sandstone and shale. Consequently, infiltration is slow, 0.06 to 0.2 in/h. Diablo soils have a surface layer that is sandy loam to clay loam in texture. Altamont soils have a surface layer that is 35 to 50 percent clay and a subsoil that ranges from clay to clay loam in texture.

Ground Water
Occurrence and movement
Historically, the movement of ground water has been downgradient along Los Penasquitos Creek (fig. 11) into lower Los Penasquitos Canyon in the Soledad basin (fig. 5). The alluvial fill in the Poway basin is blocked by an outcrop of basaltic rock in the lower reaches of the Poway Valley. This rock acts as a dam, which has, in the past, produced a spring (Ellis and Lee, 1919). Above this rock, in the western part of the Poway valley, the water table is near land surface (Ellis and Lee, 1919).
Ground-water reconnaissance work was done in the Poway Valley by the U.S. Geological Survey in 1969. At that time, water levels were measured at about 70 sites. Movement of water was downgradient to the west, towards the Soledad basin (fig. 11). Since then, the number of wells in use has continued to decline. Although depth to ground water in the valley area during 1969 (fig. 11) ranged from 4 to 70 feet and during 1984-85 (fig. 12) ranged from 7 to 88 feet, comparison of this data shows that overall in the basin, water levels have increased in many wells. Figures 11 and 12 show altitude of water surface below land surface in 1969 and 1984, respectively. If the average specific yield of the basin is assumed to be 0.1 (Johnson, 1967), in October 1984 there were about 2,330 acre-ft of ground water in storage.

In summary, because of slow infiltration rates or thin soil profile, the Redding, Olivenhain, Placentia, Friant, Escondido, Cieneba, and Fallbrook soils may be less suitable for reclaimed-water recharge sites than the Diablo, Altamont, Vista, and Ramona soils which tend to be thick and have faster infiltration rates.

Recharge
Most of the recharge to the alluvial aquifer comes from Poway Creek, but applied-water return, precipitation, and ground-water flow from surrounding sedimentary rock also contribute water to recharge the aquifer.

48 Water Resources, Soledad, Poway, and Moosa Basins, San Diego County, Calif.

Applied water includes septic-tank discharges, municipal outside use, and irrigated agriculture. The use of septic tanks is limited in the Poway basin and therefore only contributes minor amounts of recharge water to the alluvial aquifer. Currently, no reclaimed water is discharged into the ground water (Michael McCann, California Regional Water Quality Control Board, San Diego Region, written commun., 1985). Evapotranspiration accounts for most of the water for irrigation and municipal outside use, so that only a small percentage is available for percolation to the aquifer.
Measurements made during 1984-85 indicate that water levels experience seasonal fluctuations (table 16). Most of the water levels are higher in the spring, when water use is low and recharge is high due to precipitation and increased streamflow; water levels are lower in the summer, when water use is high and recharge is low.
Ground-Water Quality
In general, water from the alluvial aquifer is more mineralized than water from the Poway Group or granitic rock. Analysis of water-quality data collected between 1958 and 1965 shows that ground water from the alluvial aquifer had higher dissolved-solids concentrations than the ground water obtained from granitic rock (fig. 13). Concentrations of sulfate, chloride, and nitrogen also exceeded basin objectives much of the time in water from the alluvial aquifer.
Granitic rock. Concentrations of dissolvedsolids from water samples collected in the early 1960's ranged from

610 to 820 mg/L. Chemical water types, determined mathematically by computing the relative concentration of cations to anions in chemical equivalents (Hem, 1985), were generally mixed. Only one well had concentrations of chloride that exceeded basin objectives. Concentrations of all other constituents were below established basin objectives.
Data collected in 1984-85 indicate that water quality of the granitic rock has not deteriorated. Water types remain generally mixed including sodium chloride bicarbonate, sodium-calcium, or sodiummagnesium chloride. Chloride concentrations exceeded basin standards in several wells sampled. Concentrations ranged from 140 to 570 mg/L. Dissolvedsolids concentrations ranged from 520 to 1,600 mg/L, and 50 percent of the wells sampled exceeded basin objectives. In well 14S/1W-8D1, concentrations of nitrogen (nitrite plus nitrate as N) were as great as 13 mg/L, which exceeded the basin objective of 10 mg/L. Concentrations of all other constituents were at or below established basin objectives.
Poway Group. No historical waterquality data were available for the ground water of the Poway Group in the Poway basin.
Chemical water type of water samples collected from wells that yield water from the Poway Group is sodium calcium or calcium sodium chloride. Concentrations of chloride range from 330 to 380 mg/L, exceeding the basin water-quality objective of 300 mg/L. Dissolved-solids concentrations ranged from 830 to 990 mg/L, also exceeding the basin water-quality objective of 750 mg/L. All other constituents were below concentrations established for basin objectives.

Alluvial aquifer.

Water-quality data

collected m the early 1960's indicate

that water in the alluvial aquifer was of

marginal quality. These wells exceeded

established basin objectives for dis-

solved solids and chloride. Dissolved-

solids concentrations ranged from 1,200

to 3,300 mg/L, and chloride concen-

trations ranged from 380 to 1,200 mg/L.

Sulfate and nitrate each were present in

concentrations exceeding basin objectives

in separate well water.

Analysis of a 1984 sample from well 14S/2W-22C1S, which obtained water from the alluvial aquifer, as well as from granitic rock, is evidence that water quality of the alluvial aquifer has not improved. The dissolved-solids concen-
tration of 1,500 mg/L for water from this well exceeded basin objectives. Nitrogen, sulfate, and chloride concentrations also exceeded basin objectives.

In general, water from the alluvial aquifer probably does not meet basin objectives for dissolved solids, chloride, and sulfate. Results from the 1984-85 water-quality sampling period are shown in tables 7 and 8 and figure 14.

Surface Water
Streamflow characteristics
Streamflow data are summarized in table 9, and locations of stream gages are shown in figure 12. Recorded streamflow into the Poway basin is from Poway Creek, Rattlesnake Creek, Beeler Creek, and Pomerado Creek. All outflow from the basin is through Los Penasquitos Creek, which flows through the center of the basin.
The largest creek is Los Penasquitos Creek, which drains a total of 31.2 mi 2 of urban, agricultural, and undeveloped land in the Poway basin. Flow in Poway,

Beeler, and Los Penasquitos Creeks is partly regulated by reservoirs. Pomerado and Rattlesnake Creeks are unregulated streams. Flow in the basin is limited to fall to early spring, when there is precipitation.
Surface-water quality
Water-quality data from Beeler, Rattlesnake, and Los Penasquitos Creeks are shown in table 10. These data were collected in March 1985 and, as these creeks are intermittent, represent typical flow conditions.
With the exception of Beeler Creek, the dissolved solids ranged from 830 to 1,300 mg/L. The chemical water types are sodium calcium or sodium magnesium chloride. Basin standards were exceeded for dissolved solids and chloride in both Los Penasquitos and Rattlesnake Creeks.
Comparison of these data shows the quality of water in Beeler Creek to be much different from that of the other creeks in the basin. Concentrations of dissolved solids are lower, and the water contains higher proportions of calcium and bicarbonate. Beeler Creek drains the southern part of the basin and is separated from the Poway Valley by a range of low hills. Poway Conglomerates make up the dominant geologic material in this drainage basin, whereas granitic rock and alluvium are the dominant geologic material in the drainage of Rattlesnake and Los Penasquitos Creeks. The Beeler Creek drainage basin is also largely undeveloped compared to other basins that drain the Poway Valley. These two factors may contribute to the anomalous water quality of Beeler Creek.
Concentrations of trace elements were negligible, and pesticides were not detected in the stream water.

Reclaimed Water

Imported-water quality

All municipal wastewater from the Poway basin goes into the city of San Diego wastewater-treatment facilities. This reclaimed water is discharged into the ocean off Point Loma. Reclaimed water from the central part of the basin, the area served by the city of Poway, averaged 3.5 Mgal/d, totalling 3,900 acre-ft, in 1984 (Robert Foerster, city of Poway, written commun., 1985).
Before the basin attained its present population, a wastewater-treatment facility near the western edge of the basin in Los Penasquitos Canyon served the entire area. The treatment facility is not in use because it is not equipped to treat water to secondary-treatment standards (State of California, 1977) and because it no longer has the capacity to serve the present needs of the basin.

The chemical character of the two water supplies is similar because both
come from almost the same sources. The quality of water supplied by the city of San Diego is summarized in table 11 (Mary H. Middendorf, city of San Diego Water Utilities Department, written commun., 1985). Water-quality data for the city of Poway are shown in tables 17 and 18 (Robert Foerster, city of Poway, written commun., 1985). Chemical water types are somewhat more mixed in the water supplied by the city of Poway than that supplied by the city of San Diego. Chemical water types in the water supplied by the city of San Diego are generally sodium chloride sulfate, but in the water supplied by the city of Poway, sodium calcium sulfate chloride is the dominant chemical water type. Concentrations of trace elements are negligible.

Imported Water
Sources and quantity
All the municipal water supply in the Poway basin is imported. Both the city of Poway and the city of San Diego supply water to this basin. The city of San Diego supplies the western part of the basin with water from Miramar reservoir. This water is discussed in the Soledad basin section of this report. The water is a blend of Colorado River water, California State Water Project (SWP) water, and surface water from San Diego County. The water supplied by the city of Poway, which is stored in Lake Poway, consists entirely of Colorado River and SWP water. Both agencies purchase the imported water from San Diego County Water Authority, which purchases it from the Metropolitan Water District.

Water Use
The usable water supply in the Poway basin is composed of imported and local ground water. Imported water is used exclusively in the municipal water supply served in the area. The use of ground water is limited to individual well owners, generally for domestic supply. Wells also occasionally supply water for irrigation use. Surface water has not been developed for use because flows are intermittent.
The California Regional Water Quality Control Board, San Diego Region (1975; 1979) noted existing and potential beneficial uses of surface and ground water for the Poway basin. During summer 1984, the U.S. Geological Survey conducted a field survey of water use in the subarea. These uses generally concur with those listed in the 1978 amendments.

Specific applications of the various water supplies are discussed in detail under their various headings in this report.
As population and acreage of developed lands increase, water demand also will increase. Projections from 1980 to 2000 for the entire Los Penasquitos hydrographic subunit, which includes the Poway basin, are described in the "Water Use" section of the discussion of the Soledad basin. These trends and percentage increases probably also apply to the Poway basin. In summary, the amount of water needed will increase by about 100 percent by the year 2000. Agricultural water demand is expected to decrease, while commercial, industrial, and domestic demands are expected to increase.

Water demand based on population and land use data is presented in table 19. The methods of estimation have been described in the Soledad section. Uses such as commercial and industrial have not been included, and therefore total water demand is actually greater than 13,750 acre-ft/yr.
Ground Water
Ground water in the Poway basin is used for agricultural, industrial, and domestic purposes. Wells are located throughout the area but are most heavily

used on the edges of the basin, where municipally supplied water is unavailable or inconvenient. The primary use for ground water is for domestic purposes; agricultural uses are secondary. According to the U.S. Salinity Laboratory (1954) system of classification of irrigation suitability of water, most of the well water sampled in the Poway basin was rated low for sodium hazard but high for salinity hazard. Therefore, the ground water may be of marginal quality for irrigation use.
New development in the Poway basin probably depends on imported water supplies.

Surface Water

Because surface water in the Poway

basin is intermittent and undependable,

it generally is unused as a source of

water supply.

The beneficial uses

associated with surface water include contact and noncontact recreation, agriculture, and habitat for fish and wildlife.
Reclaimed Water
The city of Poway is considering building a new wastewater-treatment plant that would have the capacity to serve the entire service area (Alan Archibald, city of Poway, oral commun., 1985). Adequately treated wastewater from this plant could be used for irrigation in an area downstream from the treatment plant. The new plant might be built at the site of the old plant 4 miles from the city. If this site is used, the reclaimed water might be used somewhere in the Soledad basin because the treatment plant would be immediately upstream from the Soledad basin boundary. These plans are still in a preliminary stage, and sites for the treatment facility as well as the basin to be used for ground-water recharge have not been selected yet. However, the recharge basin probably would be downstream from the treatment plant, and the city of Poway is considering Los Penasquitos Canyon.
Imported Water
Imported water is used for irrigation, industry, and domestic purposes in the Poway basin. The city of Poway supplies water to most of the basin. The city's service area covers the entire Poway Valley. In 1984, the volume of water supplied to the basin was 12,350 acre-ft, an increase nearly double the volume of the 1983 supply, which was 6,430 acre-ft. Water supplied to the basin has increased by 160 percent since 1970. Water demand will increase proportionately with the expected increase in population.

Poway Basin 63

MOOSA BASIN
Location
The Moosa basin, about 100 mi 2 in area, is the farthest north of the three study areas (fig. 1). Development is agricultural and low-density residential. The basin is characterized by steep, rocky, rugged hills. Avocado and citrus groves occupy most of the arable slopes. Three golf courses, each surrounded by small housing developments, take up most of the flatland areas. Moosa Creek is the major natural drainage in the area.
Population
The population and land-use forecasts for the Moosa area are based on a San Diego Association of Governments report (written commun., 1985) in which the Moosa area is not specifically defined but rather included as part of the greater Valley Center census tract. Land use patterns on the 1980 land-use maps appear evenly distributed throughout the Valley Center area, indicating that the population estimate for 1980 (table 20) is fairly accurate. However, because rugged terrain limits building space in the Moosa area, population projections to 2000 may not be accurate. The actual population in the Moosa basin probably will be proportionately lower than the projected population for the rest of the area.

[From San Diego Association of Governments, written commun., 1985]

Year
1980 1990 2000

Population
2,215 4,000 5,000

Population in the Moosa area is expected to increase rapidly between 1980 and 2000. The growth rates are expected to peak during the 1980's and decline slightly in the 1990's.
The population for the Valley Center area is expected to increase by 140 percent between 1980 and 2000. A 70percent increase is expected for the 1980's, and a 40-percent increase is expected during the 1990's. This growth is reflected in an anticipated 420percent increase in the amount of land developed for residential use in the area. This increase probably will be somewhat lower for the Moosa basin because of the limited space in the Moosa area compared to the rest of the Valley Center area.

Land Use
Undeveloped land makes up the largest percentage of the Moosa area. Rugged terrain has precluded intensive urban development. Of the 17,900 acres that make up the area, about 16,500 acres are currently undeveloped (table 21). Land in the Moosa area is used mostly for agriculture, urban housing, and golf courses (fig. 15).
There are no population centers in the Moosa area. The population is spread out along the flatlands adjoining Moosa Canyon and South Fork Moosa Canyon and in a fairly flat upland valley in the southern part of the study area.

Orchards account for most of the agri-

cultural land.

The orchard trees,

mostly citrus and avocado, are adaptable

to the steep hillsides and therefore

occupy lands that would otherwise be

unused. Field crops are restricted to

the flatlands and occupy a much smaller

percentage of the total agricultural

lands.

The amount of developed land in the

Valley Center area is expected to

increase by 340 percent between 1980

and 2000 (table 21).

The largest

increase is expected in residential

housing. As in the population extrap-

olations, the land-use figures may

actually be somewhat lower, although

the trends will probably be similar.

Water-Quality Objectives
The establishment of and rationale for water-quality objectives has been described previously. The same criteria tor the establishment of water-quality objectives apply to the water of the Moosa basin. Tables 22 and 23 present the water-quality objectives for surface and ground water in the Moosa basin. In addition to the objectives listed in table 23, the domestic use of ground water warrants the application of requirements of the State of California (1977) (tables 3 and 4).

Hydrologic System

In the Moosa basin, alluvial deposits are found on the floors of Moosa and South Fork Moosa Canyons (fig. 16). Alluvial deposits cover about 2 mi 2 in the basin. Older and younger alluvium occur alongside each other throughout most of the basin. The younger alluvium, which is generally a thin layer of boulders, gravel, sand, silt, and clay, is located adjacent to the streams and usually is above the water table. Gravels, sand, silts, and clays make up older alluvium, which usually underlies or lies adjacent to the younger alluvium. The older alluvium generally extends below the water table and composes the alluvial aquifer.
Little information is available on ground water in the Moosa basin. Crystalline rocks are the most important source of ground water. Ground water is derived from the joints, fractures, and weathered zones of the granodiorite. Well yields vary greatly in this unit, ranging from 4 to 250 gal/min.
The alluvial aquifer contributes some water to wells in the Moosa basin. Alluvial fill extends along Moosa Canyon from the western edge of the basin about 5 miles east in a band less than 0.25 mile wide. Along South Fork Moosa Canyon alluvial fill extends to the southern edge of the basin about 3.5 miles south in a band also less than 0.25 mile wide.

Geologic Units and their Water-Bearing Characteristics

Soils

The Moosa basin is underlain dominantly by the Woodson Mountain Granodiorite of Cretaceous age and lesser amounts of metavolcanic and volcanic rocks. These basement rocks are overlain by alluvial deposits found in the major stream valleys (fig. 16).

More than 10 soil groups are found in the Moosa basin (U.S. Soil Conservation Service, 1973). The Cieneba-Fallbrook, Fallbrook-Vista, and Acid Igneous Rock are dominant; in fact, they cover such a large area that they could be considered exclusively representative of the area.

Other soils located in the basin are Escondido, Greenfield, Los Posas, Ramona, Placentia, Tunjunga, Visalia,
and miscellaneous associations of river wash and gullied lands. Because these soils cover such a small part of the basin, the present discussion is limited to the three dominant soils in the area. Visalia soils are also included in the discussion because they cover the valley floors. Figure 17 shows

Cieneba-Fallbrook soils have developed from material weathered from granodiorite (fig. 17). These soils cover most of the basin and have been previously described in the discussion of Poway basin. These soils are thin, usually rocky, and have a slow infiltration rate that may make them unsuitable as reclaimed-water use sites.
Fallbrook-Vista soils are found in the northern and southern parts of the basin (fig. 17). These soils also have been described in detail in the discussion of Poway basin. Briefly, Fallbrook-Vista soils are similar to the Cieneba-Fallbrook soils; they are located at the same altitudes and have the same geologic parent material.

70 Water Resources, Soledad, Poway, and Moosa Basins, San Diego County, Calif.

Fallbrook-Vista soils, however, are thicker, generally 20 to 57 inches, and have faster infiltration rates, 2 to 6.3 in/h. These differences make FallbrookVista soils more suitable than CienebaFal Ibrook soils as reclaimed-water use sites.
Visalia soils in the Moosa basin are located on 2 to 5 percent slopes in the canyon bottoms. These soils are sandy loams that form granitic alluvium. The soils are up to 40 inches deep, and the infiltration rate ranges from 2 to 6.3 in/h. Because Visalia and Vista soils are thick and have relatively rapid infiltration rates, they are good soils for reclaimed-water recharge sites.
In summary, because of slow infiltration rates or thin soil profile, the Cieneba-Fal Ibrook soils may be less suitable for reclaimed-water recharge sites than the Fallbrook-Vista or Visalia soils.
Ground Water
Occurrence and movement
Thickness of alluvial deposits varies greatly. The greatest depths are found in the downstream section of Moosa Canyon. Drillers' logs indicate that the depth of alluvial material in Moosa Canyon is less than 50 feet, and in South Fork Moosa Canyon the depth probably is less than 20 feet. There are about 941 million ft 3 of alluvial fill in the Moosa area. Information on well yields in the alluvial aquifer in the Moosa basin is sparse. However, well yields are probably less than 100 gal/min.
Recharge to the alluvial aquifer originates primarily outside the basin as flow in upper Moosa Canyon. Streamflow, imported water for irrigation and municipal use, ground-water flow from the surrounding aquifer, and precipitation also contribute to the recharge. Groundwater discharge leaves the basin as streamflow through lower Moosa Canyon (fig. 18).

Recharge studies done by the U.S. Geological Survey in July 1984 (table 24) along Moosa Creek show that in places both Moosa and South Fork Moosa Creek lose water to the alluvial aquifer. These sections are located downstream, where the slope of the creekbed has flattened out and the channel bottom is mostly sandy (fig. 19).
Springs, as well as flowing wells, have been reported in Moosa and South Fork Moosa Canyons. Two wells, one in Moosa Canyon and one in South Fork Moosa Canyon, are reported to flow throughout the year. Both wells are located near the stream channels and both tap non-alluvial material, indicating that water from the surrounding rock also recharges alluvial aquifer. Ground water also comes to the surface in the lowest part of the basin near All Seasons Campground (fig. 18).
Seasonal water-level fluctuations in the Moosa basin are minimal. Measurements from June and October 1984 and March 1985 show that water-levels tend to be higher in the spring, during and immediately following the wet period, and lower in the autumn, at the end of the dry period (table 16). Water levels range from flowing to 15 feet below land surface throughout the year. If the average specific yield of Moosa basin is assumed to be 0.1 (Johnson, 1967), ground-water storage, based on October 1984 water-level measurements, is about 17,000 acre-ft. Previous studies indicate that the alluvial aquifer in the lower part of Moosa Canyon in the Moosa basin is at maximum capacity (California Regional Water Quality Control Board, San Diego Region, 1984).
Little historical information is available on water levels in the Moosa basin. Water-level measurements are available for several wells from 1954-66. Water levels during this period ranged from 14 to 40 feet below land surface (fig. 18). Comparison with data collected in 1984-85 (fig. 19) indicates that water levels may have risen slightly since the 1960's.

Ground-water quality
Most of the ground water used in the Moosa basin comes from the granodiorite. In most of San Diego County, water from this unit has a chemical water type of sodium to calcium bicarbonate and dissolved-solids concentrations ranging from 250 to 1,500 mg/L (California Department of Water Resources, 1967). The California Department of Water Resources (1967) attributed the presence of higher concentrations of dissolved solids to human activities.
Water samples collected in October 1984 and March 1985 indicate slightly different trends. Dissolved-solids concentrations ranged from 490 to 1,200 mg/L (fig. 20). Sodium is the dominant cation, and calcium is second in dominance; the dominant anion, however, is chloride rather than bicarbonate (fig. 20). In general, little difference was detected between the October and March samplings.
Higher concentrations of dissolved solids were found in water samples from

wells in which water was derived in whole or in part from the alluvial aquifer. In these wells, dissolved solids ranged from 1,100 to 1,200 mg/L. Chemical water types, determined mathematically by computing the relative concentration of cations to anions in chemical equivalents, were similar to the water types found in the hard rock, dominantly sodium calcium chloride sulfate.
Chemical character of ground water derived from both the alluvial aquifer and the granodiorite is similar. In both cases, the ground water is typically sodium calcium chloride and hard to very hard; concentrations exceed established objectives for one or more constituents. The largest difference in the water derived from the two units is the concentration of dissolved solids, as was discussed previously. In general, the chemical quality of the ground water in the Moosa basin does not meet objectives established for the basin. Chloride and dissolved solids exceeded established objectives in most of the wells sampled.

78 Water Resources, Soledad, Poway, and Moosa Basins, San Diego County, Calif.

Sulfate exceeded criteria in 30 percent of the wells sampled and iron in one well. Data from the October and March samplings are summarized in tables 7 and 8.
Historical ground-water data are limited in the Moosa basin. Records were available for one well in the basin. The sample was collected in August 1954. The chemical water type at that time was sodium chloride bicarbonate, and dissolved solids concentration was 600 mg/L. All constituents for which analysis was done were below established objectives.
Surface Water
Streamflow characteristics
There are no stream-gaging stations in the Moosa basin. Streamflow data were collected during the sampling periods in October 1984 and March 1985. These flow data are presented in table 24, and location of flow and quality measuring sites are shown in figure 19.
Streamflow into the Moosa basin is from Moosa Canyon and South Fork Moosa Canyon. All surface-water flow leaves the basin through Moosa Canyon in the northwest corner of the basin.
Streamflow in upper Moosa Canyon is intermittent; flows occur mostly in conjunction with storm runoff, although agricultural return and ground water feed lower Moosa so that it flows most of the year.
Surface-water quality
Water-quality data from Moosa and South Fork Moosa Creeks are presented in table 10. These data were collected in October 1984 and March 1985 in order

to represent base and storm flows, respectively.

Dissolved-solids concentrations in the

surface water in the Moosa area, ranging

from 1,300 to 1,700 mg/L, exceed basin

objectives.

In general. South Fork

Moosa Creek has lower dissolved-solids

concentrations than Moosa Creek. Lower

concentrations of dissolved solids also

occur during storm flow. There were no

other major changes between the fall and

spring samples. Based on the calcula-

tions of the data collected in 1984-85,

the chemical water type of Moosa Creek

and South Fork Moosa Creek is sodium

calcium chloride bicarbonate.

Concentrations of dissolved solids and chloride exceeded basin objectives. Upper Moosa Creek had sulfate values
that exceeded established objectives in both the autumn and spring samples; however, lower Moosa and South Fork Moosa Creeks had much lower sulfate concentrations. No other constituents met or exceeded basin objectives. Concentrations of trace elements were negligible, and no pesticides were detected in any of the stations sampled.

Reclaimed Water
Reclaimed-water quantity
A wastewater-treatment facility is located in the northwestern corner of the Moosa basin. This facility, owned and operated by the Valley Center Municipal Water District, serves most of the basin and can treat 0.5 Mgal/d. The plant currently maintains three percolation ponds, which are located just outside the basin in the Bonsall hydrologic subbasin. The total volume of the ponds is 60 acre-ft. These ponds are the only means of wastewater disposal. Adequately treated water from this facility is a potential source of reclaimed water.

This secondary treatment and disposal facility has been in operation for about 10 years (California Regional Water Quality Control Board, San Diego Region, 1984). Expansion of the facility is planned from its current capacity of 0.5 Mgal/d to 1.0 Mgal/d. The handling of wastes from the community of Valley Center, which is located outside the basin, is the main reason for the expansion.

established for ground water in the basin. Daily maximum allowable concen-
trations for various constituents have been established by the California Regional Water Quality Control Board (1984) (table 26). Water containing concentrations greater than those listed would not be used in percolation ponds or irrigation supplies. Use of reclaimed water may improve the quality of ground water in this area (California Regional Water Quality Control Board, San Diego Region, 1984).

Comparison of ground-water samples collected from wells at Circle "R" and Lawrence Welk golf courses (fig. 20) with secondarily treated water indicates that the reclaimed water is less mineralized than the local ground water (table 25). Concentrations of most constituents, other than bacteriological, were lower in the reclaimed water. The primary exceptions to this were nitrogen and phosphorus. The range of nitrogen concentrations exceeded objectives

A typical ratio of the blend is 80 percent Colorado River water and 20 percent SWP water (Ken Simon, Valley Center Municipal Water District, oral commun., 1985). The water stored for use in the Moosa basin is contained in large tanks located on the hills throughout the area and in Turner Reservoir.

The quality of the imported water is similar to that of the imported water used in the Soledad and Poway basins and is generally better than that of the local ground water. Water-quality data for Colorado River water and California State Water Project water are presented in table 27.
Water Use
Ground water is used for irrigation supplies in the Moosa and South Fork Moosa Canyon areas. This irrigation water is mainly applied to golf courses and pasture lands. Domestic wells supply water to wells mainly in the Moosa Canyon area. Imported water fills the rest of the basin's domestic and agricultural needs. Surface water in the basin is intermittent and therefore not a dependable water supply.

the trends are assumed to be the same, However, the rugged terrain could
retard development, so that projections for the Moosa basin are probably less than those anticipated for the rest of the hydrographic subarea. Overall water
demand for agricultural, as well as domestic, commercial, and industrial uses are expected to increase.

Moosa Basin 83

Estimated water demand, based on population and land-use data, is presented in table 28. The methods of estimation are described in the Soledad section. As municipal and agricultural needs make up most of the basin's water demands, the two together probably represent the total water demand for the basin.

of classification of water as to its suitability for irrigation, the ground water of the Moosa basin is marginal for irrigation supplies because of high salinity hazard. With the expected use of reclaimed water for irrigation supplies in these areas, the primary use of ground water may become domestic.

Ground Water
Ground water in the Moosa basin is currently used for both agricultural and domestic purposes. The largest agricultural use of ground water is for irrigation of golf courses. According to the U.S. Salinity Laboratory (1954) system
TABLE 28. Estimated and projected water demand in the Moosa basin, in acre-feet per year
[Projections for agricultural water demand may actually decrease by the use of reclaimed water for irrigation water on two golf courses, as planned by the Valley Center Water District. Municipal projections based on estimated 0.22 acre-feet per year percapita water production for the city of Escondido. Information from California Regional Water Quality Control Board, San Diego Region (1975)]

Surface Water
Surface water in the Moosa basin is mostly intermittent and therefore not a dependable water supply; consequently, it is generally not used as a watersupply source. The beneficial uses associated with surface water are contact and noncontact recreation, agriculture, and habitat for fish and wildlife. These uses have been designated for the entire Bonsall hydrographic subunit, of which the Moosa basin is a small part. No other uses of surface water are projected for the basin.
Reclaimed Water
Current plans for reclaimed-water use are oriented toward providing water suitable for irrigation supplies. When the new wastewater-treatment plant is fully operational, reclaimed water from the plant, as well as ground water extracted downstream from the percolation ponds, may be used to irrigate Circle "R" and Lawrence Welk golf courses located in the downstream part of the Moosa basin.

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
Reclaimed-water is being considered as a supplemental water supply in the Soledad, Poway, and Moosa basins, San Diego County. This report examines the geology, soils, hydrology, and cultural factors in each of the basins as they apply to use of reclaimed water.
Imported water is currently the major water-supply source in the basins. Ground-water supplies are used to a limited extent for both agricultural and domestic needs. Surface-water flows are intermittent and therefore have not been developed for use in the basins. All three of the basins have the potential for use of reclaimed water; however, only the Moosa basin currently has such a plan.
The population of the Soledad basin, which in 1980 was 65,390, is expected to increase by 140 percent by the year 2000. Imported water meets most of the basin's water demands. Ground water is used for domestic and agricultural supplies in the northern part of the basin. In this area, the alluvial aquifer contains about 260 acre-ft of ground water in storage. Concentrations of dissolved solids in ground water ranged from 1,000 to 2,000 mg/L throughout the basin. Concentrations of dissolved solids, chloride, sulfate, and iron commonly exceeded established basin objectives. As of 1985, plans under consideration for the use of reclaimed water were oriented toward improving the quality of the ground water. One likely plan included pumping the highly mineralized water out of an aquifer and replacing it with reclaimed water that contains lower concentrations of dissolved solids. The only anticipated use of this recharged ground water is for irrigation.
The population of the Poway basin was 3,350 in 1980 and is expected to increase by 140 percent by the year 2000. With this increase, the water demand also will

increase. Imported water currently supplies most of the basin's water demands. Ground water is used to a limited extent throughout the eastern part of the basin for domestic and agricultural needs. The alluvial aquifer in the Poway basin contains about 23,300 acre-ft of ground water in storage. The quality of water from the alluvial aquifer is generally more mineralized than that found in other water-bearing formations. Concentrations of dissolved solids ranged from 500 to 1,600 mg/L throughout the basin. Concentrations of dissolved solids and chloride commonly exceeded basin objectives. As of 1985, there were no plans to use reclaimed water in the Poway basin.

The population of the Moosa basin was

2,215 in 1980 and is expected to increase

by more than 100 percent by the year

2000. As of 1985, most of the basin's

water demands were filled with imported

water. Ground water was used for

domestic and agricultural purposes by

individual well owners. The alluvial

aquifer in the Moosa basin contains

about 16,000 acre-ft of ground water in

storage. Dissolved solids in ground

water ranged from 470 to 1,200 mg/L

throughout the basin. Concentrations of

dissolved solids and chloride commonly

exceeded basin objectives. One plan for

use of reclaimed water was to supply

irrigation water on two golf courses in

the lower Moosa and South Fork Moosa

Canyons.

The reclaimed water was

expected to be less mineralized than the

local ground water; after percolation

into the aquifer, such water may improve

the quality of the ground water.

If, as expected, the population in the Soledad, Poway, and Moosa basins increases by more than 100 percent between 1980 and 2000, water demands will increase accordingly. As of 1985, imported water, chiefly from the Colorado River, met most water needs of the three basins. None of the basins have dependable surface-water supplies to help meet expected needs. Ground-water supplies

Summary and Conclusions 85

in all the basins also are insufficient to meet expected needs, because the supplies are small and water quality does not meet basin objectives. Ground water in the basins generally exceeds established objectives for concentrations of dissolved solids, chloride, and sulfate. In the Soledad basin, iron concentrations in most water samples exceed basin objectives.

As of 1985, reclaimed water was under

consideration to supplement irrigation

supplies on two golf courses in the

Moosa basin. The applied reclaimed

water was expected to be less mineralized

than the local ground water used for

irrigation supplies.

Infiltration of

reclaimed water into the basin may

improve the water quality of the allu-

vial aquifer in the lower part of the

basin.

No wastewater-treatment facilities exist in the Soledad or Poway basins. The city of Poway is considering construction of a wastewater-treatment plant in Los Penasquitos Canyon at the western edge of the basin. Reclaimed water produced from this plant may be used to recharge and improve the quality of the ground water in an aquifer downstream and to create an irrigation-water supply. Recharge with reclaimed water could improve the ground-water quality in any of the alluvial aquifers in the Soledad basin. The alluvial aquifers in the Soledad basin are near full saturation, however, so that ground water would
have to be removed by pumping before reclaimed water could infiltrate, dilute, and replenish existing groundwater supplies. The lower Moosa Canyon, the lower part of Los Penasquitos Canyon in Poway basin, and Soledad Valley also are near storage capacity and could benefit from the recharge of less mineralized reclaimed water.

The use of reclaimed water under consideration for the Moosa and the Soledad basins would supplement the water supply used for irrigation. Although this action would alleviate part of the total demand, it would not alleviate the water demand for domestic uses, which make up the largest part of the total water demand. To meet the expected shortages of the total water supply, other plans may need to be explored.
