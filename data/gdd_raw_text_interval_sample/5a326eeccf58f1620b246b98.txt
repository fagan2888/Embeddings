abstract
This study aims at assessing the mechanical importance of the conspicuous sclerenchymatous ‘Dictyoxylon’ cortex of the extinct gymnosperm Lyginopteris oldhamia by comparing the latter to the extant angiosperms Carica papaya and Ochroma pyramidale, both possessing a cortex composed of mechanically relevant wedges of phloem ﬁbres. Our studies show that the anatomical structure of the cortex in L. oldhamia is very similar to C. papaya and O. pyramidale and that comparable variations occur in the cortex of L. oldhamia as found in C. papaya and O. pyramidale when reorienting oblique stems or branches. This similarity in (adaptable) anatomical structures leads to the conclusion that the cortex of L. oldhamia was also able to readjust the orientation of stem and branches as a reaction to mechanical stress, shown for C. papaya and O. pyramidale. This ﬁnding supports the hypothesis that L. oldhamia stems might well have been self-supporting in (very) young ontogenetic stages and became semi-self-supporting or climbing in older ontogenetic stages.

1. Introduction
Carica papaya and Ochroma pyramidale possess self-supporting erect stems of a height of up to 12 m (Sprecher, 1943) or 20 m (Fletcher, 1951), respectively, and occur in tropical and subtropical regions. Stem stiffness in trees of C. papaya and O. pyramidale is provided to a considerable part by the secondary phloem forming a lattice-like arrangement of partly sclerenchymatous ﬁbres and resembles the similarly arranged outer ‘Dictyoxylon’ (= mesh) cortex in Lyginopteris oldhamia, an extinct species common in the Upper Carboniferous of Europe (300 Myr B.C.). Also the ‘Dictyoxylon’ cortex consists probably of sclerenchymatous ﬁbres. These cortical structures are mechanically very important, as sclerenchyma ﬁbres are responsible for mechanical stability necessary to withstand internal and external loads whereas the wood plays a limited mechanical role in these three genera. This is substantiated by the fact that O. pyramidale has one of the lowest wood densities (Chave et al., 2009) or that wood is completely lacking in the parenchymatous xylem of C. papaya (Sprecher, 1943).

growth-form of L. oldhamia has been interpreted in various ways: selfsupporting trees (Retallack and Dilcher, 1988), semi-self-supporting (leaning) plants (Zimmermann, 1959; Andrews, 1961; Mägdefrau, 1968; Speck et al., 1992; Stewart and Rothwell, 1993; Speck, 1994a, 1994b; Speck and Rowe, 1999; Rowe and Speck, 2004) or even lianoid climbers (Potonié, 1897–1899; Scott, 1923; Phillips, 1981; Galtier, 1986, 1988). Masselter et al. (2007) favoured a semi-self-supporting growth eventually becoming lianoid in relatively old ontogenetic stages after shedding the mechanically important sclerenchymatous outer ‘Dictyoxylon’ cortex. In C. papaya, the outer cortex with its phloem ﬁbres is mechanically the most important structure contributing mainly to stem stiffness. Its morphology is strikingly similar to the ‘Dictyoxylon’ cortex in L. oldhamia (Fig. 1), raising the question whether this resemblance is just mere appearance or mirrored by a similar mechanical function that has evolved convergently. In L. oldhamia, the ‘Dictyoxylon’ cortex supports the stem in relatively young to middle-aged stages. In older stages, the increase in diameter of inner secondary tissues induces an extensive straining and ultimately disruption and loss of the cortex, resulting in a considerable drop of ﬂexural stiffness (Masselter et al., 2007). In C. papaya, the structure of the phloem ﬁbre mesh is also strained by secondary growth (Kempe et al., 2013, 2014). This straining is not only vital for realising a tree-like stem with increasing stem diameter but also for the realignment and reorientation of the stem after tilting (Kempe et al., 2013, 2014). Another extant plant that holds strikingly similar structures in the outer cortex is O. pyramidale (Fisher and

Müller, 1983). This tree with soft wood is also supposed to reorient its stems by eccentric growth of the secondary xylem and differential straining of the secondary phloem ﬁbres (Fisher and Müller, 1983). Most probably many (if not all) Malvaceae and related families exhibit such a structure in the phloem, which would explain the large number of ﬁbre producing species in the family.
This leads to the intriguing question of whether the straining of the ‘Dictyoxylon’ cortex could also have helped to stabilize and re-adjust the self-supporting orientation of the stem in Lyginopteris oldhamia. Consequently, the changes in morphology of Carica papaya, Ochroma pyramidale and L. oldhamia will be compared to answer that question, mainly relating to studies of the functional morphology and biomechanics of these plants by Fisher and Müller (1983), Masselter et al. (2006, 2007), Masselter and Speck (2014) as well as Kempe et al. (2013, 2014).

2. Material and methods
The specimens of Carica papaya and Ochroma pyramidale shown in Fig. 1 are side-branches of a fully mature plant originating from a commercial plant nursery and the Botanic Garden Osnabrück, respectively. Samples were cut from the curved region of the branch that is subjected to external stresses (mainly by gravity) and shows adaptive growth in order to reach/keep a vertical upward orientation. This allows for determining the changes in anatomy on both the adaxial and abaxial side of the bent branch. Thin sections for light-microscopy were prepared with a cryo-microtome (SLEE medical GmbH, Mev Cryostat) and studied unstained with an Olympus BX61 microscope prior to phloroglucinol staining in order to determine whether ligniﬁed tissues within the xylem and phloem of C. papaya and O. pyramidale are present or not.

The origin of Lyginopteris oldhamia specimens is described in detail in Masselter et al. (2006, 2007). These studies as well as those by Kempe et al. (2013, 2014) also provide the formulae and methodological approaches for the biomechanical tests in Carica papaya as well as for the ontogenetic and biomechanical reconstruction of L. oldhamia. Due to the very small number of tangential sections in the latter species, we analysed the straining of the ‘Dictyoxylon’ cortex preferentially in cross-sections.
3. Results
3.1. General anatomy
3.1.1. Carica papaya The primary organisation of Carica papaya consists of a parenchyma-
tous pith (Fig. 1A, 1) and primary phloem ﬁbres (2). The secondary tissues originate from a cambium that produces a virtually unligniﬁed secondary xylem (3) and partly ligniﬁed secondary phloem (4). Phloem ﬁbres form a mesh structure (4a in Fig. 1D, E, J, K) and are tangentially separated by a phloem parenchyma (4b in Fig. 1D, E, J, K) in which regions with several cell divisions can be observed (Fig. 1K, arrows). The axes analysed in the present study have a diameter of approximately 8 mm.
3.1.2. Ochroma pyramidale The primary organisation of Ochroma pyramidale consists of a paren-
chymatous pith (Fig. 1B, 1) and primary phloem ﬁbres (2). The

secondary tissues are well developed and formed by a cambium that generates ligniﬁed secondary xylem (3) and ligniﬁed secondary phloem (4). Phloem ﬁbres form a mesh structure (4a in Fig. 1F, G, L, M) and are tangentially separated by a phloem parenchyma (4b in Fig. 1F, G, L, M) in which regions with cell divisions can be observed (Fig. 1M, arrows). The diameter of the analysed axes is approximately 11 mm.
3.1.3. Lyginopteris oldhamia The primary organisation of the stem shows a central parenchyma-
tous pith (Fig. 1C, 1) and primary phloem (2) and a thick cylinder of secondary xylem (3) and secondary phloem (4). The inner primary cortex (5) consists of parenchymatous cells and includes leaf traces (6) and a periderm (7) (Fig. 2D), which forms the outermost tissue when old axes have shed the outer sclerenchymatous ‘Dictyoxylon’ cortex (8). This outer cortex is composed of more or less axially arranged sclerenchymatous strands (8a) with parenchymatous intercalations (8b) (Fig. 1H, I, N, O) with occasional cell divisions (Fig. 1I, O). The sclerenchymatous strands again form a mesh-like structure in tangential section (Fig. 1N, O). Diameters of mature axes range from 5 to 40 mm (Masselter et al., 2006, 2007).
3.2. Secondary tissues
Secondary tissues, i.e. secondary xylem and secondary phloem originate from a vascular cambium that is present in all three species producing a signiﬁcant amount of markedly ligniﬁed xylem in Ochroma pyramidale and Lyginopteris oldhamia. In contrast, the secondary xylem

in Carica papaya is only poorly ligniﬁed. The amount of secondary phloem in C. papaya is higher compared to that of O. pyramidale. The gymnosperm L. oldhamia shows extensive formation of secondary xylem with ligniﬁed tracheids and only a moderate amount of secondary phloem. Low density wood, i.e. wood consisting of relatively few tracheids and a high number of parenchymatous wood rays is a common feature of O. pyramidale and L. oldhamia.
3.3. Changes in cortex during reorientation
3.3.1. Carica papaya On the adaxial side of the reoriented tilted branch the parenchyma-
tous tissue that ﬁlls the honeycomb-like mesh of phloem ﬁbres shows regions with many cell divisions expanding the net of meshed phloem ﬁbres tangentially (Fig. 1K).
3.3.2. Ochroma pyramidale In Ochroma pyramidale as well, regions of cell divisions are visible in
the parenchymatous tissue within the honeycomb-like mesh formed by the phloem ﬁbres (Fig. 1M) that consequently expands in tangential direction on the adaxial side of the branch.
3.3.3. Lyginopteris oldhamia The outer ‘Dictyoxylon’ cortex is progressively strained by the in-
creased diameter of secondary vascular tissues. In young axes, the cells of the parenchymatous intercalations are isodiametric and most likely unstrained (Fig. 1H, N). In older ontogenetic stages, these cells are tangentially elongated indicating prior straining (Fig. 1I, O). This straining further increases with ongoing growth of secondary tissues. Additionally, cortex regions of extensive cell divisions in the parenchymatous intercalations exist (Masselter et al., 2006, 2007). Such regions also occur in axes in which other parts of the cortex are not strained (Fig. 2).

4. Discussion
The anatomy of the secondary phloem of Carica papaya and Ochroma pyramidale is very similar, as described by Fisher and Müller (1983). In both extant angiosperm species the ﬁbre structure supports or is essential for the reorientation of tilted plants or branches (Fisher, 1980). Anatomical changes observed at the base of tilted stems during reorientation are identical to the anatomy of the base of lateral branches. Enlarging the circumference by radially directed growth of the secondary xylem – with more pronounced xylem formation on the adaxial side – causes the phloem mesh to expand in a tangential direction, inducing a contraction on the adaxial side and reorientation of the stem (Kempe et al., 2014) (Fig. 3). It can be stipulated that this mechanism also holds true for lateral branches as the same changes in anatomy, i.e., radially directed growth of the xylem and expansion of the phloem mesh, can be observed on the adaxial side of the studied branches (Fig. 1A, B, D–G, J–M). Cell division in the phloem parenchyma is expected to be a passive response to the extension of inner secondary tissues (xylem) to avoid rupture of the outer tissues.
The anatomy of the primary cortex of Lyginopteris oldhamia is very similar to Carica papaya and Ochroma pyramidale. However, due to the fossilized stage the mechanical relevance for stem support or reorientation by tangential straining of the cortex cannot be veriﬁed by mechanical tests. Therefore we like to address this problem on a theoretical basis by considering the two points suggested by Fisher and Müller (1983) for mechanical relevance of the cortex in L. oldhamia: (1) an interconnected mesh of ﬁbres forming a skeleton must be developed as well as (2) these interconnections must be persistent, i.e. no slippage between ﬁbre strands of the mesh in the attachment zones. This holds true for the ‘Dictyoxylon’ cortex in L. oldhamia until the cortex is ﬁnally shed in old ontogenetic stages. This, together with areas of cell division and elongation (Masselter et al., 2006, 2007) similar to those in C. papaya and O. pyramidale is a strong indication of a mechanically responsive tissue. This tissue allows for reorientation of stems and side branches due to tangential straining of ﬁbre meshes in the cortex in L. oldhamia.
In order to determine if the structural similarity between the ﬁbre meshwork (net) of the secondary phloem of Carica papaya, Ochroma pyramidale and the primary cortex of Lyginopteris oldhamia can have the same function, the structural Young's modulus and the ﬂexural stiffness of the three genera are compared below.

4.1. Structural Young's modulus

Fig. 3. Schematic illustration of the deformation of the adaxial (upper) side of the phloem ﬁbre mesh in Carica papaya and associated shortening (arrows) of the mesh that leads to a reorientation of the stem. The mesh has been cut away by approximately one quarter in order to show the abaxial (lower) side of the phloem mesh that remains unstrained.

The structural Young's modulus generally increases in selfsupporting plants with plant age (Speck, 1994a, 1994b; Speck and Rowe, 1999). Individuals of Carica papaya show values from of 1.0 ± 0.2 GPa for stems of a height of approximately 1.5 m and up to 2.5 GPa for mature stems (Kempe et al., 2013). These values are low compared to mature woody plants, since the bending modulus of “green” wood often is in the range of 10 GPa (Speck, 1994a, 1994b; Speck and Rowe, 1999; Kretschmann, 2010). The water content of axes of C. papaya exceeds 90% for secondary xylem while the secondary phloem contains approximately 90% (Kempe et al., 2013) and its maintenance is essential for the self-supporting habit of the plant (Kempe et al., 2013).
In young plants of Ochroma pyramidale with heights between 0.25 and 0.44 m, the structural Young's modulus is found to be 0.2–0.3 GPa (Christensen-Dalsgaard and Ennos, 2012). Young's modulus for specimens from mature wood with 12% wood moisture content is given with 3.4 GPa (Kretschmann, 2010). As the Young's modulus for such dried specimens is generally 20 to 30% higher than that for fresh specimens (compare values in Kretschmann, 2010 as well as ChristensenDalsgaard and Ennos, 2012), a value of approx. 2.4–2.7 GPa for mature fresh “green” wood of O. pyramidale can be assumed.
The structural Young's modulus of Lyginopteris oldhamia was calculated to have a mean value of 3.1 ± 0.7 GPa in relatively large axes

262 T. Masselter et al. / Review of Palaeobotany and Palynology 246 (2017) 258–263

with a mean comparable diameter of 27 ± 24.5 mm (Masselter et al., 2007). In summary, the structural Young's moduli of mature stems are similar for all three plants ranging from 2.4 to 3.1 GPa.
4.2. Flexural stiffness
In Carica papaya, the values range from approx. 0.1 Nm2 for young axes less than one year old and a diameter of ca. 2 cm to approximately 5 Nm2 for 2 year old axes and approx. 5000-50,000 Nm2 for older axes with thick stems with a diameter up to 15 cm (Kempe et al., 2013).
No values for the ﬂexural stiffness of Ochroma pyramidale could be found in literature. Based on the data of Christensen-Dalsgaard and Ennos (2012) of 0.28 GPa for the Young's modulus of seedlings with a diameter of between 0.82 and 1.3 cm, a ﬂexural stiffness of 0.08– 0.5 Nm2 can be calculated.
Mean values range from 0.1 Nm2 for very young axes to 73.5 Nm2 for the largest (menetogenetic) axes in Lyginopteris oldhamia (see Masselter et al., 2007). For (very) young axes, the values of ﬂexural stiffness in Carica papaya, Ochroma pyramidale and L. oldhamia are comparable. For older stems the data base for a reliable comparison is scarce.

In contrast to Lyginopteris oldhamia, reorientation of woody fossil stems is most often accompanied with the occurrence of reaction wood as it is still present today. While the presence of fossil reaction wood is well proven for rather ‘recent’ eras of the Tertiary (Groover, 2016), as well as for the late Cretaceous and early to middle Jurassic (Blanchette et al., 1991; Chapman and Smellie, 1992; Wheeler and Lehman, 2005; Bodnar et al., 2013), evidence of reaction wood in earlier periods is often rather inconclusive (Schmid, 1967) but is also reported convincingly for Cordaixylon from the Pennsylvanian (Rowe and Speck, 2004; Taylor et al., 2009). These provide an interesting and approximately contemporaneous occurrence of righting mechanism in big pycnoxylic trees and the lighter cortex-dominated structures in the seed fern L. oldhamia.
It can be stipulated that these two reorientation systems for stems and branches. i.e. 1) the straining of the cortical mesh vs. 2) reaction wood that are still present today and have evolved independently were both present, albeit largely undetected, in fossil plants since the Carboniferous.
5. Conclusions

4.3. Growth form
Carica papaya and Ochroma pyramidale are able to form selfsupporting stems and grow as small to medium sized trees (Sprecher, 1943; Fletcher, 1951). The ﬂexural stiffness is similar compared to Lyginopteris oldhamia in very young ontogenetic phases with a steep increase by a raised second moment of area with increasing age in C. papaya (and most probably also in O. pyramidale), which is typical for self-supporting trees and shrubs (Speck et al., 1992; Speck, 1994a, 1994b; Speck and Rowe, 1999; Rowe and Speck, 2004). The increase of ﬂexural stiffness in L. oldhamia is much slower with maximum values that are 68 to 680 times smaller compared to those measured for older axes in C. papaya. Based on these calculations and structural considerations, L. oldhamia was reconstructed as a semi-self-supporting plant that eventually becomes lianescent in old stages of growth after shedding the outer cortex (Masselter et al., 2007).
The results presented in this paper make it very probable that the outer primary cortex of Lyginopteris oldhamia is tangentially strained during increasing secondary growth, and the resulting shortening of the cortex may have resulted in an overall stiffening of the stem. Additionally if differential growth on two stem halves exists this may allow a reorientation of tilted axes also in this fossil species. Such a reaction of the cortex cannot be veriﬁed by serial sections along a bent stem in the fossils of L. oldhamia as the measurements are based on individual cross-sections from different specimens each representing only one speciﬁc developmental stage. However, as in curved specimens of Carica papaya (Fig. 1A) and Ochroma pyramidale (Fig. 1B), a distinct difference in different opposed parts of the outer regions can be seen in individual stem sections of L. oldhamia (Fig. 2). Therefore, it is conceivable that the regions with more isodiametric and putatively less strained cells correspond to the lower side of a bent stem (abaxial side in case of a branch) and the regions with elongated and therefore previously strained cells to the upper side of the stem (adaxial side in case of a branch).
In summary, the comparative analysis of stems of all three species support the idea that Lyginopteris oldhamia had self-supporting slender stems in very young developmental stages, i.e. thin axes, as the ﬂexural stiffness is comparable to Carica papaya and Ochroma pyramidale, then entered a transitional (may be, however, long-lasting) semi-selfsupporting stage, and ﬁnally became lianescent in relatively old developmental stages after the ‘Dictyoxylon’ cortex was shed. Thus, the young and thin axes of L. oldhamia should have been able to reorient tilted stems and branches by differential secondary growth and concomitant tangential straining of the ﬁbre meshes in the ‘Dictyoxylon’ cortex, as it has been shown for C. papaya and O. pyramidale.

The cortical anatomy of the extant plants of Carica papaya and Ochroma pyramidale is very similar to the one described for the extinct seed fern Lyginopteris oldhamia. Ontogenetic (developmental) changes in the peripheral ﬁbrous network play a major role for ﬂexural stiffness and growth form also in terms of stem/branch reorientation. This is of special interest since the conspicuous ‘Dictyoxylon’ structure of L. oldhamia was generally considered not to exist anymore since the species is extinct. While this is undoubtedly true from an evolutionary perspective in the line of seed ferns and later relatives, we hypothesize that stems with a similar functional principle evolved several times independently during evolution, demonstrated by the secondary phloem of C. papaya and O. pyramidale representing only two examples of an unknown diversity of extant and fossil pants with similar functional traits. In light of the results of the present study, the ontogeny of L. oldhamia so far considered to be semi-self-supporting and later lianescent has now been completed and extended by adding a self-supporting early stage revealing a much more complex picture than previously expected including the ability to readjust the orientation of stems and branches by adaptive straining of the cortex. To the best knowledge of the authors, this is the earliest evidence of tissue adaptability based on differential growth of secondary tissues actively responding to inclination to re-align branches and stems. The present study again proves the importance of learning from functional morphology and biomechanics of extant plants for a better understanding of fossil plants even if the compared plants are not or only very distantly related.
