A Detailed Stratlgraphic and Quality Analysis of the Anderson Coal Deposit,
Johnson County, Wyoming
By
Robert G. Hobbs, J. Daniel Cathcart, Stephen B. Roberts,
and Richard N. Babcock
ABSTRACT
In 1983, the U.S. Geological Survey drilled and sampled a thick Anderson coal deposit reported by previous U.S. Geological Survey investigation (Pierce and others, 1982).
At the sampling location, central Johnson County, Wyoming, the total gross coal thickness including partings is 201.85 ft; the net coal thickness is 197.99 ft.
The coal is characterized by low ash and sulfur contents, and a rather uniform Btu/lb (dry, mineral-matter-free basis). Its overall indicated , apparent rank is subbituminous B with some probable zones of subbituminous A.
A total of six depositional zones within the overall coal bed have been identified: very thin lower and upper transition zones (floor and roof coals), three major coal zones, and one major rock parting. The three coal zones each have distinct depositional characteristics and reflect major changes in the coal swamp environment.
A rock parting, about 140 ft from the top of the coal, may have been caused by a major flooding--a result of a regional geologic event. The coal deposit above this parting shows significant differences from the coal below.
A correlation between coal zone 1 of this report and the thick AndersonCanyon coal bed of the Arvada-Spotted Horse area of Sheridan and Campbell Counties, Wyoming, is probable.
INTRODUCTION
In 1983, the U.S. Geological Survey, in cooperation with the Bureau of Land Management, conducted a coal and water resource exploratory drilling project in central Johnson County, Wyoming. The objective was to evaluate the thick Big George coal bed reported by Pierce and others (1982).
This report includes a detailed stratigraphic evaluation of the coal bed, evaluation and interpretation of the coal proximate and ultimate analytical data, apparent specific gravities, the relationship of the ash content to the apparent specific gravities and Btu/lb, and the possible coal depositional environment. Comparisons and possible correlations have been made to the Anderson coal bed at other locations near Arvada, Wyo.

The sampling location, drill hole No. B32-B61C, is located in the SE1/4SE1/4 sec. 7, T. 48 N., R. 77 W., Johnson County, Wyoming. It is about midway between Buffalo and Gillette (see fig. 1).

Unless otherwise specified, the data and interpretations contained in this report are restricted to this sampling location and are not to be construed as applicable to the entire Big George coal deposit or the Anderson Canyon coal beds of the Powder River Basin except where noted.

COAL CORE DESCRIPTION

The roof rock, coal, and floor rock core description are shown in appendix A. This was done concurrently with the apparent specific gravity determinations and after the X-ray radiographic investigation.

The core description includes the entire cored interval from a depth of 1,028.0 to 1,265.45 ft. The roof rock, coal, and floor rock intervals are:

Roof rock Coal Floor rock

1,028.00 - 1,051.00 ft 1,051.00 - 1,252.85 ft 1,252.85 - 1,265.45 ft

The 201.85-ft-thick coal deposit, examined megascopically, is characterized by thin transition zones from floor rock to coal and from coal
to roof rock, as well as an overall increase in the vitrain content and a gradual decrease in apparent specific gravity from the top downward to the base. Also important is the sparse to absent occurrence of sulfur in the pyritic and sulfate forms throughout the coal deposit, the extensive bleeding of methane gas from the coal core, and the oil-stained floor rocks at the depth of 1,255.95-1,256.20 ft.

SAMPLING

The Anderson coal core was sampled for several ongoing research investigations. The methods and procedures used were designed to maximize data available from the core while maintaining representative sample data.

The first sampling was for the methane in coal investigations. The intervals chosen for methane content and composition determinations are shown in table 1, and were reported by Boreck (1984) and Boreck and Weaver (1984).

The remaining solid unbroken coal core was packaged and sealed in 2-ft plastic tubing for X-ray radiograph!c examination. The broken coal was packaged and sealed in plastic bags. The rock parting, with minor coal at a depth of 1,188.15-1,192.25 ft, was boxed.

With completion of the X-ray examination of the tubed" samples, the entire
remaining core was megascopically examined and described, and the apparent specific gravities determined. The rock and coal core samples were'described, handled, and packaged following the guidelines in Hobbs (1979). The core description is shown in appendix A; the apparent specific gravity determinations are shown on table 2.

The sample intervals selected for the proximate and ultimate analyses, Btu/lb, and other determinations are shown on table 3. The sample interval for other investigations, though not part of this study but included to show the completeness of the samples selected, is shown in appendix B, tables B-l and B-2. The rock parting at 1,187.87-1,191.95-ft depth was removed and excluded from any of the foregoing samples.

The roof rock samples at 1,028.00-1,051.00-ft depth and floor rock samples at 1,252.85-1,265.45-ft depth were investigated by the South Dakota School of Mines and Technology for various rock mechanic properties (Hladysz,
1983 and 1984).

COAL QUALITY

General

The sample intervals for the proximate and ultimate analysis, Btu/lb, forms-of-sulfur, and ash-fusion temperatures are shown on table 3. The analytical results by sample interval, as well as the weighted average for overall coal bed, are shown on table 4. Table 5 shows the AFT (ash-fusion temperatures Â°F). The sample intervals and the analytical results included in
this report total net coal intervals at this sample location.

Free-swelling index (FSI) determnations were made for each sample; all were 0.0.

Calorific value

Overall, the calorific values of this coal bed are relatively uniform. The statistical values for the Btu/lb on a dry, mineral-matter-free (dmmf) basis are:

Btu/lb

Mean
Standard deviation Median Range Lowest value
Highest value

13,193
173 13,195
867 12,558
13,425

Only two samples, BG3A and BG6, had a Btu/lb, dmmf value of less than 13,000.

In 1983, the U.S. Geological Survey conducted a study of the coal deterioration between time of acquisition (coring) and proximate and ultimate
analysis (Hobbs, 1983). In that study the Anderson-Canyon coal sample, 80AU15, showed an approximate loss of 1 Btu/lb per day from the time of core sampling'to analysis. As the time interval from the Big George coal core acquisition to the coal analyses (table 4) was approximately 6 months, application .of these data to data from samples of the Big George coal bed would suggest that the Btu/lb values of table 4 are about 180 Btu/lb lower than the original Btu/lb values at the time of sample acquisition.

Moisture

The moisture content range is:

All samples (percent)

Less sample B-27 . (percent)

Mean Standard deviation Median Range Lowest value Highest value

22.60 1.94 22.01 9.64 17.20 26.84

22.79 1-69 22.01 6.63 20.21 26.84

Equilibrium moisture values for these samples, were not determined. However, equilibrium moisture values of the Anderson-Canyon coal were 26.6 percent at 80AU15 and 25.52 percent at 80AU16 (Hobbs, 1983). A decrease in the moisture with an increase in the rank would be expected (Stach, 1982, p. 40), and, together with an increased depth of burial, a moisture value of less than 25 percent would be reasonable for the Big George coal bed of this report. Table 4 displays an average (on a weighted basis) moisture value of 22.91 percent and is considered to be less than the equilibrium or the inherent bed moisture of this coal bed at this sampling location. The true moisture is probably greater than the 22.91 percent of this study, and less than the 25.52 and 26.6 percent of the 80AU15 and 80AU16 samples.
Based on a 1 percent decrease of inherent coal-bed moisture per 150 m depth of burial (Stach, 1982), a reasonable estimate of the inherent moisture of the Anderson coal deposit at this sample location, which is about 150 m deeper than at the 80AU15 and 80AU16 localities, would be 24.5 percent.
Sulfur
The total sulfur content of the Big George coal bed samples is anomalously low throughout the analyzed intervals. Only three samples showed appreciable total sulfur contents: BG-3A, BG-3B, and BG-27. BG-3A and BG-3B are associated with a rock parting. BG27 is a 0.60-ft coal floor sam'ple*

14

One possible explanation for the low percentage of the sulfide minerals
within the coal bed may be their alteration and partial redeposition by ground water. Evidences for this are the occasional gypsum rosettes and other .gypsiferous fillings and coatings found in the coal-bed cleat systems, assuming that these secondary minerals originated from sulfides in the coal bed and were not introduced subsequent to coalification. ~

;For the most part, the ;ash content is very low with about 91 percent of

the analyzed footage snowing a 3.00 percent or less ash content on an

as-received basis. These data are:

Less sample B27 (percent)
2.87 1.48 2.36 5.42 1.56 6.98

Overall, the ash content on the dry basis is quite uniform. This, however, is contradictory and anomalous to the apparent specific gravities. This will be discussed in detail in the interpretation section.
RANK
The questionable moisture content of these samples prevents their ranking on a moist basis according to the American Society for Testing and Materials Standards (ASTM Stds., 1983, D388-82, sec. 7.1.4, p. 241). However, an approximation of the rank, using the ASTM Parr Formula 3, can be made by using the average estimated inherent moisture of 24.5 percent*
Based on these data, the overall moist, mineral-matter-free.Btu/lb is 9923 and the calculated apparent rank is subbituminous B. The estimated Btu/lb loss between sample acquisition and analysis is about 180 Btu/lb. The estimated heat content at the time of sample collection is 10,100 Btu/lb, moist, mineral-matter-free basis. In view of the above, the overall coal bed

15

rank at the time of sampling was subbituminous B; in some zones, particularly in the lower 60 ft, the coal rank may be subbituminous A.

HARDGROVE GRINDABILITY INDEX

' " .;' .

The-.Hardgrove Grindability Index (HGI) determinations were not made of

coal from this core. However, the ;coal of this deposit resembles, in

megascopic appearance and physical characteristics such as the ease of

breaking both vertically and laterally, the coals of samples 80AU15 and

8QAU16.: The HGI of these coals was 54.2 at 22.04 percent moisture and 59.2 at

23.90 percent moisture, respectively (Hobbs, 1983). An approximation of the

overall HGI of the : Big George coal deposit at this location would be a minimum

of 55^60 at,a moisture content of 23 percent. ,

APPARENT SPECIFIC GRAVITY
.The apparent specific gravity (ASG) determinations using the weight in air/weight in water method were performed on the samples. Moisture levels of .the samples were not individually determined at the time of the ASG measurements./ However, the samples had been kept moist and for the most part sealed since acquisition; thus, any coal desiccation and possible oxidation were believed minimal. It is assumed that the samples were at equilibrium moisture conditions.
The ASG values for 2-ft sample intervals (table 2) were plotted against depth and are shown on figure 2. The average ASG values for the intervals shown on table 3 were likewise plotted with depth and are shown on figure 3.
These plots show the varied range of ASG values from the coal-bed top to the base. Among other things, the banded characteristics can be interpreted from figure 2. Also, the plots show the overall decrease of the ASG values from the top to the base of the coal bed.

INTERPRETATIONS
1. Apparent specific gravity versus the coal ash (mineral matter) composition.

If the coal ash were of the same composition throughout the coal bed, a direct correlation between the ash content (percent) of the coal and its ASG should be possible. This correlation is not possible. The coal ASG values (table 2 and fig. 2) and the average.coal ASG of these values for the analysis shown on table 3 and figure 3 show a considerable ASG range throughout the coal bed while the ash content (percent.) remains rather uniform. To illustrate this, the ash content of each sample (as-received basis) was against its corresponding ASG and is shown on figure 4. This plot illustrates the varied '".r'ang'e .of the ASG compared to the .ash content (percent).
The data points shown on figure 4 were grouped according to their best logical fit and a linear regression analysis was made of each group; the groups and the results of the linear regression analysis are presented on table 6.

;;" Several coal zones are worth noting, such as the lower ASG values of samples BG-25 and BG-26. The lower values are related to the .enclosed sandstone parting at a depth from 1,246.45 to 1,247.00 ft. The high ASG values are at depths of 1,175.45 and 1,216.00 ft. The
; high ASG value and the low Btu/lb zone, at about 1,118.00 ft depth , (sample BG-6), are macerated plant debris. The effect of the
abundant plant debris and macerated plant material within the interval 1,111.65-1,127.65-ft depth (samples BG-5A to BG-8) is shown in all three plots.
2. Depositional characteristics

The Big George coal bed of this sampling location has been divided into six distinct units or zones (fig. 6) based on the ASG, the coal core description (appendix A), and the analytical data.
The analytical data for coal zones 1, 2, and 3 are shown on table 7; the lower transition zone is represented by sample BG-27 (table 4). The rock parting is not included in the analysis and the upper transition zone analysis is included in sample BG-1 (table 4). Table 8 shows the combined analysis (weighed) of the lower transition zone and coal zone 1.

The coal ash.ASG on either side of this parting is much lower than\the average.for zone. 1, indicating the major.source of the ash in "samples BG-25 and BG-26 was this parting. The sand of the parting intermixed with the peat material both above and below the sand parting prior to coalification.
-The source of the higher ASG at a depth of 1,223.60-1,210.25 ft (samples BG-20 and BG-21) is indicated to be two thin partings(?) at depths of 1,210.25Â± and 1,216.25 ft. these partings are interpreted as a volcanic ash fall and the higher ASG of the coal on either side of the parting at 1,216.25 ft and below 1,216.25 ft reflects the input from these partings. " It shows an input of mineral matter of a higher ASG into an otherwise uniform coal of low ASG.
This coal zone represents a very stable coal environment of a protected area. The organic humic material was derived from predominantly thick woody material, and surface ground water was relatively clean and free of contaminants. The dominant constituent of the ash was probably fixed by the growing vegetation. Parting: 1,191.95-1,188.60 ft
This rock parting represents the end of the stable swamp environment of coal zone 1. The deposition of the sandstone parting indicates a sudden or massive influx of a high energy depositional system as shown by the sharp contact of the rock parting with respect to the underlying coal. The parting probably represents the effects of a major regional tectonic event such as a sudden basin or area subsidence, or an uplift causing an increased stream gradient with a higher suspended load and massive flooding. This sandstone parting also represents a change in the coal-forming environment from coal zone 1. Also, the influx of rock effectively terminated the coal-forming swamp at the time of its deposition at this location.
26

Coal zone 2; 1,188.05-1,143.85 ft
> ; The re-emergence or re-establishment of the coal swamp at .this location Is shown by the coal transitional zone at the base of coal-zone 2, or at the top of the parting at depths of 1,188.60-1,188.05 ft. This thin 0.55 ft of coal is allochthonous and is the beginning of coal zone 2.
.; Analytically.(table 4), the coals within this zone are very similar to coal zone 1. The coal ASG at 0 percent ash is slightly higher than in coal zone 1, reflecting the lower vitrain content about 70 percent as compared to greater than 80 percent of:coal zone 1. This may be the result of a reduction in the density-ofTwopdyvmaterial, such as a less dense forest. The significant difference of this zone from coal zone 1 is the ASG of the coal ash.
In coal zone 2, the ash ASG is indicated to be midrange to high-density calcium oxide "to aluminum oxide base in contrast to the low density of coal zone 1. A thin parting is present at a depth of 1,160.50 ft and is probably a volcanic ash fall. The ASG plot (fig. 2) showing the higher ASG zones alternating with the lower ASG zones indicates alternating periods of medium and higher density ash (mineral matter) input. This may be due to fluctuating water composition and (or) depth and (or) suspended load, occasional light dust storms, or light falls of a material such as volcanic ash.
Coal zone 3: 1,143.85-1,051.10 ft
Beginning at a depth of about 1,143.85 ft, the coal depositional pattern changes significantly from predominant vitrain to less than 50 percent vitrain with an increase in attrital and fusain coals becoming important to dominant. The ASG plot (fig. 2) is interpreted as cyclic deposition with alternating zones of macerated and other plant debris. One zone, as represented by sample BG-6 at a depth of 1,117.65-1,119.65 ft, shows the effects of this macerated plant humic material; lower Btu, higher ash.content, and higher coal ash density.
The interpretation of the detailed ASG of this zone (fig. ?.) shows a possible cyclic-type deposition: low ASG with predominantly woody material increasing to a higher ASG with nonwoody plant material debris becoming more important. The cycle is then repeated* .
Moreover, the overall dmmf Btu/lb is slightly lower than the underlying coals of coal zones 2 and 1, reflecting the decreasing amount of vitrain or woody material present.
The coal swamp environment at this sampling location appears to have changed and is Influenced, more than coal zones 1 and 2, by an outside source such as a fluvial and (or) lacustrine system nearby-or w1th1n"the swamp-environment.
"27

Upper transition zone: 1,051.10-1,051.00 ft

The termination of the coal-forming swamp and environment at this location appears to be abrupt. .It is not a gradual
transition as shown by the .very thin upper transition debris zone and abrupt^contact with the overlying carbonaceous shale.

. -This coal bed is primarily autochthonousi especially below a

. deplth of about 1,143.85 ft. 'This .is evidenced by the exceptional

thickness, overall uniformity of the calorific value (Btu/lb),

... ; low sulfur content, and generally very low ash content of the

coals. The coal ash source is apparently dominantly mineral

matter fixed by the growing plants. The contribution of ash from

other sources such as contaminated surface water with a high

suspended or colloidal load appears to be minimal. The zone from

1,143.85 to 1,051.00 ft may be mixed, the intervals of abundant

plant debris representing an allochthorious contribution of drift

material into, and intermixed with, the autochthonous peat

material.

.

CORRELATION TO ANOTHER AREA

The Big George coal bed at this sampling location is considered to be, in
part at least, the Anderson-Canyon coal bed of the Arvada-Spotted HorseRecluse area of eastern Sheridan and northern Campbell Counties, and the Wyodak coal bed of central Campbell County, Wyoming. This is based on stratigraphic and coal correlations (Pierce, 1982). At this sample site the
lower part of the Big George coal bed from 1,191.95- to 1,251.85-ft depth is very similar in respect to the Anderson-Canyon coal bed of the Arvada-Spotted Horse area of eastern Sheridan and northern Campbell Counties, Wyoming (Hobbs, 1982, 1983).

The quality similarities are:

Quality - uniform high Btu/lb value
Rank - apparent subbituminous B, drill hole 80AU15 Ash - low, uniform Sulphur - low, uniform Maceral - predominately over 80 percent vitrain

The coals of both areas represent similar coal-swamp conditions and conditions that were stable throughout their respective coal-forming periods. Finally, the inception and termination of each coal-swamp environment were similar both rather rapid.

These data, together with the stratigraphic .interpretations, support a

correlation of the Arvada-Spotted Horse, Anderson-Canyon coal bed to the lower

part of the Big George coal deposit.
