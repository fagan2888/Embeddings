PETROLEUM WITHDRAWALS AND RESTORATIONS AFFECTING THE PUBLIC DOMAIN.

By MAX W. BALL.

INTRODUCTION.

b

The oil industry in the public-land States is of so great magnitude and is so intimately affected, especially under recent court decisions,
by withdrawals of Government land, that a demand has arisen for trustworthy copies of the orders creating or diminishing the with-
drawals. Partly to meet this express demand and partly in the belief that matters which concern the public's interests can not be too readily available to the public, this bulletin has been prepared. It contains true and accurate copies of orders of withdrawal, restoration, modification, and classification, and of the more important correspondence leading to changes of policy regarding these; an index to the orders, township by township; a short statement of the purpose of the withdrawal policy; and a brief review of the history of oil withdrawals. In addition, it includes a chapter on oil-land law, giving the statutes and decisions, judicial and departmental, which may be of most interest to the oil operator on the public domain. The pocket at the back of the bulletin contains maps showing the areas withdrawn in each State Arizona, California, Colorado, Louisiana, Montana, North Dakota, Utah, and Wyoming where oil withdrawals are now outstanding (Jan. 15,1916).1 No maps are given of Oregon and New Mexico, in which all lands formerly withdrawn have been restored, nor of Alaska, where the withdrawal includes all oil-bearing lands without regard to location. The scale of the State maps, except that of California, is 24 miles to the inch. A map of the Salt Creek field, Wyoming, on a larger scale (3 miles to the inch) is given, on which Naval Petroleum Reserve No. 3 is distinguished from the remainder of the withdrawn area. The map of California is also on this larger scale, and, in addition to distinguishing Naval Petroleum Reserves Nos. 1 and 2, it shows the patented lands and lands for which applications were pending within the withdrawn areas on

1 All the maps are correct to Jan. 15, 1916, although some of them (Arizona, California, Colorado, Louisiana, and Utah) are dated Nov.'l, 1915. In these States no change was made between the two dates, and their maps were in press before it was decided to bring the bulletin down to the later'date.

April 15, 1915. These facts as to land titles have been compiled and platted from Land Office records by Mr. J. H. G. Wolf, of the Bureau of Mines. They have not been verified by the Geological Survey or by the General Land Office, and although the Survey welcomes the opportunity to add to the usefulness of this publication by including them, it assumes no responsibility for their correctness. It was originally intended to distinguish the departmental withdrawal of September 27, 1909, from the subsequent withdrawals, but as the United States Supreme Court has recently removed all doubt as to the validity of this order there is no necessity for the distinction, and the map is more easily read without it.
It is hoped that this bulletin may furnish an answer to any of the usual questions regarding Government action on the public oil lands. If the exact terms of some particular order are desired the order may be easily found from the ample briefing in the table of contents. If the withdrawal history of a township is sought it will be found in the township index. If the present status of a' particular tract is wanted the maps in the pocket will show it accurately unless the tract is too small to read from the scale used, in which case its status can be ascertained by use of the township index and the orders to which the index refers.
As to completeness of material, every order of petroleum withdrawal or restoration approved by the Department from August 15, 1907, to January 15, 1916, has been included. Prior to August, 1907, such orders were prepared in the General Land Office, as a few have been since that time, and of these the Land Office has kept no complete list. A partial list was prepared by the Commissioner under date of February 28, 1902 (see S. Doc. 232, 57th Cong.,
1st sess.), and with this as a foundation a careful search was made of certain Land Office records for the years 1900 to 1904, inclusive, and of such other records as these seemed to suggest. It is believed that the result is complete as to .withdrawal and restoration orders prepared by the Land Office, but it is possible that orders other than those discovered may have been issued. However, the record of Land Office withdrawals and restorations balances that is, with the exception of a small area in California about which there is some uncertainty, every tract for which a Land Office withdrawal order has been found is covered by a Land Office restoration order. All orders of modification to conform to official surveys or to permit the issuance of patent or the making of mineral locations are given, but some orders of modification to permit the approval of rights of way have not been included. Classifications of unwithclrawn lands have not been included, but the two formal classifications of withdrawn lands are given.

PURPOSE OF THE WITHDRAWALS.

19

In a publication of this type, involving many pages of intricate, land description, absolute accuracy is both important and difficult to attain. No effort has been spared to make this bulletin accurate .in every detail.
ACKNOWLEDGMENTS.
Such a bulletin as this would be impossible without cooperation on every hand, and cooperation in fullest measure has been received. In particular Miss Stockbridge has devoted herself wholeheartedly to the success of the publication, not only in the work of compilation, but in assistance and suggestions throughout the bulletin. Credit is due also to Miss Janie M. George, who assisted for a time in the work of compilation.
Much of the material bearing dates prior to August, 1907, was obtained only through the courtesy and cooperation of Mr. W. J. Howard, chief of the mineral division, Mr. H. L. Kays, chief of the division of mails and files, Mr. L. E. Eddy, and the late W. P. Williams, all of the General Land Office. By the courtesy of Hon. Clay Tallman, Commissioner, and Mr. Frank Bond, chief clerk, photographic copies of many original orders were supplied.
Several months before the Survey undertook this task, Mr. J. H. G. Wolf, of the Bureau of Mines, conceived the idea of a bulletin similar to this but confined to the California fields, and he spent some time in preparing material for it. The greater part of this material, through the courtesy of Mr. Wolf and Mr. W. A. Williams, chief petroleum technologist of the Bureau of Mines, was turned over to the Survey, and much of it has been used, especially on the California map.
Many others, both-in the Geological Survey and in other offices, have given suggestions and assistance. The township index, for example, was first suggested by Mr. C. E. Lesher. On every hand there has been a ready spirit of helpfulness, for which this opportunity is taken to express sincere appreciation.

PURPOSE OF THE WITHDRAWALS.
The American people are vitally interested in the oil and gas resources of the United States. It is not only because the industry is an enormous one, involving hundreds of millions of dollars of capital, or because oil and gas taken together rank third in value among the country's mineral products, but principally because petroleum and its products now play so large and apparently indispensable a part in our civilization. It is difficult to imagine modern life without gasoline, kerosene, vaseline, mineral lubricating oils, and a host of other petroleum derivatives. Yet the American public should squarely face the fact that the oil fields of the United States

20 PETROLEUM WITHDRAWALS AND RESTORATIONS.
are by no means inexhaustible. It is not the purpose here to predict the life of the supply or to discuss estimates of that life, which, among men who have studied the situation, vary from fifteen to a hundred years. It is sufficient to point out that no field produces uniformly large quantities of oil for a long period, that enormous amounts of oil are being taken from the known fields of to-day, and that year by year the chance of discovering large new fields becomes less. Whether failure of the fields comes in fifteen years or fifty or a hundred and fifty, it is bound to come, and when it comes its results may be serious. To be sure, the failure will be gradual, giving time for adjustment; increased production from Latin America is likely to offset a diminishing domestic supply; in time oil distilled from the shales of the Rocky Mountain region may supply the market. But while these factors may minimize or defer the final event, the fact remains that the nation will be far poorer when its oil and gas fields are exhausted.
It is not a question of preserving a supply for coming generations at the expense of this. Posterity will have to do without what the present generation needs and can wisely use. But to-day should be careful indeed lest it waste what to-morrow will need or unwisely use what to-morrow could put to better service.
How is it with the oil situation in the public-land States ? Under a law which forces the operator to drill for oil lest he lose his land and to produce it lest his neighbor drain it from him, production has exceeded market demands during most of the last 10 years. The results ? First, large quantities of oil go into storage, where its more volatile, most valuable constituents are lost. It has been estimated that in California, for example, the value of the oil lost by evaporation is perhaps 25 per cent of the value of the total production at the well.1 For, let it be emphasized, this loss represents the most valuable part of the oil. Second, the price is reduced to a point where oil is used as fuel without separating out the constituents that are of greater intrinsic 1 value for other uses. The heavier parts of many oils are best adapted for use as steam fuel, but to burn the lighter parts under boilers is to put a limited resource to a use far lower than its maximum capability. And, again let it be emphasized, this loss represents the most valuable part of the oil. Thus one of the great assets of the American people is in part being dissipated produced in advance of demand and used unwisely. As already suggested, these losses are due to overproduction, and overproduction is due in large measure to a law that not only encourages but forces it. A reading of the chapter on oil-land law (see p. 27) will show how uncertain is a man's tenure until he has

made an actual discovery of oil. Therefore, regardless of market or transportation conditions, regardless of the selling price of oil, he drills his discovery well. Then, because the law cuts the fields into tracts so small that one tract may be almost wholly drained by wells on those surrounding, he drills more wells, regardless of whether he can dispose of his oil advantageously or at all, in order to prevent his neighbors from taking it from him. It may be that his profits would be greatly increased by leaving the oil in the ground for a few months or years; it may be that he is farsighted enough to regret the waste resulting from premature production; but the law which demands discovery and restricts his acreage prohibits his free choice and forces him to produce. Not unlikely he or one of his neighbors, in the haste with which they all must drill, lets water into the oil sand, perhaps to the ruin of the area and the loss of thousands of
barrels of oil. He would have preferred to go more slowly, to study the relative location of water and oil horizons, to have the field so developed that a maximum amount of oil might be obtained, but the oil-land law does not tend to encourage prudent or careful development. He must drill, drill quickly, drill continuously.
Under such conditions and with such a law, a single expedient is inevitable: operations must be suspended as far as possible until a more adequate law can be provided. It will not do merely to urge the passage of a new law while allowing the old one to operate. By the time Congress could act the damage would have been done beyond repair. The public domain can never be repossessed and reconsolidated after it is once disposed of in small tracts. Every day under the placer law means the location of more small claims. The only solution is to suspend the operation of the placer law on all lands believed to be valuable for oil and gas.
Such are the considerations which require and justify oil withdrawals to-day. Such were some of the considerations in 1909. Then the thought of a fuel supply for the Navy was dominant a need which is now believed to be at least partly covered by two. naval reserves in California and one in Wyoming. But, as a reading of the letters of November 11, 1908 (see p. 117), and September 17, 1909 (see pp. 133, 134), will show, along with the question of naval supply was the question of ultimate public interest the necessity for immediate action. In such an emergency strong, even severe, measures are justified. The withdrawal order of September 27, 1909, was drafted and signed. (See p. 135.)
That this was a severe measure no one will attempt to deny. Without forewarning and without precedent, it knocked the breath, for the moment, from the California oil industry. Some of the orders promulgated since have been almost as severe, although not so widespread, in their effects. These things the officers responsible for

22 PETROLEUM WITHDRAWALS AND RESTORATIONS.
them realize. The geologists who recommend or prepare withdrawal orders are not ignorant or careless of the hardships which they may cause. Many of them Western men, personally familiar with the field under consideration, knowing its people, knowing the sacrifices they may have made, the risks they may have incurred, the hopes they may entertain of striking oil, these geologists regret keenly that the development of the West may by their action be in some measure retarded. Yet without hesitation or exception they recommend that the interests of the public be made paramount.
The temporary character of the withdrawals can not be too strongly emphasized. There is no thought of tying up permanently the oil deposits on the public domain. As soon as there are satisfactory laws for the development of these deposits the withdrawals should be revoked, but in the meantime it seems certain that withdrawals will continue to be made, not as permanent institutions but as temporary expedients, to meet an abnormal condition, during a period when the needs of the situation have far outrun the adequacy of the law.
HISTORY OF THE WITHDRAWALS.
The first official report of the occurrence of oil on the public domain seems to be that of January 5,1865 a letter to the Commissioner of the General Land Office from the register and receiver at Humboldt, Cal. (See p. 59.) In reply (see p. 60) the Commissioner directed that tracts valuable for petroleum deposits be withheld from disposition unless further specific instructions to the contrary were issued. How long this suspension continued is not apparent from the data at hand, but there seems to have been nothing further of the sort until 1900. The events of that and the two succeeding years afforded a striking
illustration of the inadequate protection given by the placer law to the oil prospector during the period prior to discovery. The oil placer act had been in operation about three years, the oil industry of the West was just entering upon the remarkable activity which it still maintains, and demands came from practically every new field for the withdrawal of lands from agricultural filing so that drilling might be carried on unhampered. More than 20 withdrawal orders were issued by the Land Office, covering a large area in California, Oregon, and Wyoming.
After this withdrawal fever came a reaction. The withdrawn area was large and included much agricultural land, and intending entrymen and selectors cried out for restoration. A sentiment against the withdrawals seems to have developed in the Department, and the agents sent to investigate the fields appear to have reported as nonoil land nearly every tract upon which there were no derricks. There were 3 restorations in 1902, 13 in 1903, and 12 in 1904. Then there

was a quiescent period, followed by one restoration in 1906 and-six in 1907. One of the early withdrawal orders was not canceled until 1910 and another, involving several townships, was left outstanding until 1912. Both were in territory which has not proved to be oil bearing.
Meanwhile, Survey geologists working in the California fields became impressed with the need of the oil operators for protection against agricultural filings during the drilling period. Thus it happened that in 1907, within less than three months of the restoration by the Land Office of large areas because "it would appear that no good reason exists for the further suspension," some of the same lands, as well as o.ther areas, were withdrawn by the Department on the recommendation of geologists familiar with the situation. Additional withdrawals in California were recommended by the Survey
and approved by the Department in 1908 and early in 1909; a peti-
tion from an oil company resulted in a withdrawal in Oregon; and an area in northwestern Louisiana was withdrawn on recommendation of the Survey to prevent the waste of natural gas. These withdrawals, except that in Louisiana, were made for the same purpose as the earlier Land Office orders and were essentially similar in their scope, but they had a sontewhat more fortunate fate. They were more closely confined to prospective oil territory; they probably included less agricultural land; the number of oil operators benefited had greatly increased; large coal and phosphate withdrawals had accustomed the public to the withdrawal idea; and, perhaps most important, field examinations with a view to classification were carried on as rapidly as the funds available would permit. The lands shown by geological surveys to be nonoil were promptly restored; those offering possibilities of oil were retained in withdrawal. This was the situation in the summer of 1909.
The withdrawals up to this time, outside of Louisiana, had been aimed mainly at the "scrippers" and " oil homesteaders" who had flocked into some of the fields and filed on lands of little agricultural value in the hope either of obtaining title to valuable oil land or of forcing the oil operators to buy them out. Thus the withdrawals prohibited agricultural entry or selection, but most of them permitted mineral locations,1 so that immediate extraction of the oil was promoted rather than retarded. This at first glance appeared excellent for the producer, but when production began to outrun demand the situation became serious. The Survey's oil geologists, coming in con-
1 The withdrawals in Louisiana and Oregon were from all forms of location or appropriation. The withdrawal of Nov. 7,1908, between Coalinga and Martinez, Cal. (p. 116), is recommended "from all entry" in the opening sentence and in the closing sentence refers to " a similar temporary withdrawal from agricultural entry." Whether or not this would be interpreted to prohibit mineral entry, it did not prohibit mineral location. The remaining withdrawals were in California and Wyoming and were from agricultural entry or selection only.

24 PETROLEUM WITHDRAWALS AND RESTORATIONS.
tact with most phases of the industry, reached the conclusion that further and more radical action was necessary to meet the exigencies of the problem, and urged that the oil fields on the public domain be withdrawn from all forms of disposition, including mineral location and entry.
The reasons which led to this conclusion are essentially those upon which rest the withdrawals of to-day, and as these have been summarized in a preceding chapter they will not be discussed here. It is only necessary to say that in a letter dated February 24, 1908 (see p. 104), the Director of the Survey urged upon the Secretary that the filing of oil claims in California be suspended, in order to insure an adequate supply of fuel oil for the Navy. No action having been taken in the meanwhile, the Director renewed his recommendation on September 17, 1909 (see p. 133), at which time he pointed out the inappropriateness of the placer law and the advisability of retaining public oil lands in Government ownership until more adequate legislation should be enacted. This recommendation led to a letter of the same date (see p. 134) and similar tenor from the Secretary to the President, and to the conversion on September 27,1909 (see p. 135), of the outstanding withdrawals in California and Wyoming into withdrawals from all forms of disposition. Then followed another period of activity, some 13 withdrawals being made by the Department between October 1, 1909, and June 30, 1910.
But these withdrawals were a severe blow to a large number of operators; to some they were almost ruinous. An order so sweeping in its effects upon so large an industry and coming without warning, as did that of September 27, 1909, was little short of a cataclysm. The question was at once raised, Is the order valid? Many, among them lawyers of prominence, argued that it was not, and no inconsiderable number of operators acted on this assumption. Thereupon the President asked Congress to set all doubts at rest by definitely giving the Executive the authority to make such withdrawals, and Congress responded with the act of June 25, 1910 (36 Stat., 847). (See p. 48.) But, although the previous orders were at once confirmed under this new act, it was contended that the confirmation could not affect those who had initiated placer locations between the original and the confirmatory orders. They continued in the belief that the Departmental orders were ineffective, and thus forced the Government to its second step; it brought test suits against certain of these operators. Five years and more after the promulgation of the order of 1909, during which time thousands of barrels of oil had been extracted and two Federal district courts had held the order invalid, the Supreme Court of the United'States rendered its decision in the Midwest case/ holding the order valid and effective. The

decision was based, not on the President's power as Commander in Chief of the Army and Navy to preserve a naval fuel supply, nor on any power expressly delegated by Congress, but, in the language of the court, "* * * long continued practice, the acquiescence of Congress, as well as the decisions of the courts, all show that the President had the power to make the order."
As already stated, the withdrawals outstanding when the withdrawal act of June 25, 1910, was approved were at once ratified, confirmed, and continued in full force and effect by Executive orders.1 Since that time about thirty-five new withdrawals have been made, covering all public lands in which there is thought to be a reasonable prospect of finding valuable deposits of oil or gas. At the same time all lands which field examination has shown to be probably nonoil have been restored. By this process of withdrawing the more promis-
ing lands and restoring the less the withdrawals have, it is believed,
come to approximate more and more closely the areas from which oil will be produced, with an increase in acreage of less than 19 per cent since July 2, 1910. The confirmatory orders of that date covered approximately 4,697,600 acres; new withdrawals have included about 3,483,300 acres; and nearly 2,593,900 acres have been restored, leaving approximately 5,587,000 acres outstanding January 15, 1916, distributed as follows:

It must not be assumed, however, that these figures represent public land actually affected by the withdrawals. Most of the orders are drawn in "blanket" form; that is, they cover the areas believed to be oil bearing without regard to ownership, and in their terms include many tracts which are hi private ownership or to which valid rights have attached. Except for the comparatively small number of cases in which there may have been fraud, these lands are of course not subject to the withdrawal orders. Unfortunately, figures showing the acreages upon which the withdrawals are in reality effective are difficult to obtain. Those given below, taken from a table compiled by Mr. J. H. G. Wolf, of the Bureau of Mines, show that of the with-

drawn area in California only about 30 per cent is ompatented and less than 24 per cent is vacant on the books of the local land offices. Data are not available to show what part of this 24 per cent is covered by valid mineral locations not yet of record in the local land offices, but it is evident that the amount which is actually vacant and unappropriated is small.

The following table, which is based on figures compiled by the General Land Office, shows the approximate status of the lands withdrawn by the three orders most recently issued. The difference which this table shows between Montana and North Dakota is due to the fact that the withdrawals in Montana are chiefly within the Northern Pacific land grant, whereas the withdrawal in North Dakota is chiefly outside that grant. In addition to the lands listed as vacant, oil and gas rights will probably be reserved to the Government on many of the lands indicated as entered.

of the withdrawn area. Including lands which are vacant and unoccupied, entered lands in which oil and gas deposits will be reserved to the Government, and lands covered by invalid locations or applications, but not including lands shown as vacant on Land Office records which are in fact covered by valid locations, it seems likely that, if the present laws are enforced without change, the oil deposits in about one-half of the present withdrawn area will prove to be in public ownership.
From this outline of the history of the withdrawals it is evident that they fall into four periods: (1) The period of Land Office withdrawals from agricultural entry, prior to 1907; (2) the period of
Departmental withdrawals from agricultural entry, extending to September, 1909; (3) the period of Departmental withdrawals from all disposition, from September, 1909, to June, 1910; and (4) the period
of Presidential withdrawals from all entry under the act of June 25, 1910, beginning July 1, 1910. The chapter giving the orders and correspondence has been subdivided under these four periods, although it should be noted that some of the withdrawals in the first period were made by the Department, and that Land Office restorations will be found in the third and fourth periods.

OIL-LAND LAW.
It is not practicable within the limits of this bulletin to present an exhaustive study of the law relating to oil and gas, nor to consider every contingency which may arise in the acquisition of deposits of these minerals from the Government. In this chapter, therefore, although all the Federal statutes relating directly to public oil and gas lands are given, the citation and discussion of decisions are confined to those points which bear most immediately upon questions of general interest to oil operators, present and prospective, on Government land.

THE PLACER LAW AND THE ACT OF FEBRUARY 11, 1897.1
THE ACT OF FEBRUARY 11, 1897.
Petroleum deposits on the unwithdrawn public domain are acquired under the placer law. The act of February 11, 1897 (29 Stat., 526), which ended all doubts upon this point, is as follows:
AN ACT To authorize the entry and patenting of lands containing petroleum and other mineral oils under the placer mining laws of the United States. Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America
in Congress assembled, That any person.authorized to enter lands under the mining laws of the United States may enter and obtain patent to lands containing petroleum or other mineral oils, and chiefly valuable therefor, under the provisions of the laws
i Some of the matter under this head is taken, partly verbatim, from a previous paper (Ball, M. W.f The placer law as applied to petroleum: Am. Inst. Min. Eng. Trans., vol. 48, pp. 451-470).

28 PETROLEUM WITHDRAWALS AND RESTORATIONS.

relating to placer mineral claims: Provided, That lands containing such petroleum or other mineral oils which have heretofore been filed upon, claimed, or improved as mineral, but not yet patented, may be held and patented under the provisions of this act the same as if such filing, claim, or improvement were subsequent to the date of the passage hereof.
It is important to note that lands, to fall within the purview of this act, must be chiefly valuable for petroleum or other mineral oils. In the mining laws as they apply to the great majority of mineral deposits it is not stated whether lands, in order to be considered mineral, must be more valuable for mineral development than for any other purpose, or whether the presence of mineral in paying quantities impresses a mineral character upon the land despite other and perhaps more valuable uses. But in the case of petroleum lands there is no doubt; to be subject to entry under the placer law oil lands must be chiefly valuable for their oil content.

that the claimant of the placer claim has no right of possession of the

valuable mineral and other deposits within the boundaries thereof.

It is obvious that to interpret these sections a knowledge of the lode law is necessary, and the pertinent sections of the Revised Statutes bearing upon lode claims, together with certain sections of general application, are here given:

No. 10, v. 13, all cases are reserved exclusively to the United States, unless other- p' wise specially provided in the act or acts making the grant.
DISCOVERY, i
An analysis of the placer law shows its most important requirement to be this: A discovery of mineral must be made before exclusive right of possession and enjoyment attaches. Section 2329 of the Revised Statutes provides for entry and patent of placer claims "under like circumstances and conditions and upon similar proceedings" to those for lode claims. Section 2320 provides that "no location of a mining claim shall be made until the discovery of a vein or lode within the limits of the claim located." A number of authorities might be cited on the necessity of discovery as a prerequisite to location. Only three will be given here.2 The Supreme Court of California, inMcLemore v. Express Oil Co. (112 Pac., 59), stated the rule and outlined some of its difficulties in the case of oil lands :
* * * the principle has become axiomatic that discovery and appropriation are the source of title to mining claims, and that assessment or development work is the condition of their continued possession (27 Cyc., 588). But this rule applies only when the location is valid and complete. And a location is valid and complete only when, after compliance with other requirements, a discovery of valuable mineral in place has been made. In the case of ordinary minerals, little or no difficulty has been experienced by the courts in this matter. In practice, the miner went upon the public domain, and, before he took the trouble to stake his claim and post and record his notice, he made discovery. The staking of the boundaries of the claim and the posting of notice followed such discovery. When, however, Congress enacted that locations could and should be made of public lands containing petroleum or other mineral oils under the laws relating to placer mining claims (Act Feb. 11,1897, C. 216,
1 As to the relation of discovery to assessment work, see pp. 38,39. 2 See also Hall v. McKinnon, 193 Fed., 572; Donnelly v. United States, 228 U. S., 243; Union Mining Co. v. Leitch, 24 Wash., 585.

29 Stat., 526 [U. S. Comp. St. 1901, p. 1434]), the courts were at once confronted

with serious difficulty in their endeavor to obey the congressional mandate, and fit

the placer mining laws to the exigencies of oil locations which in their nature were

radically dissimilar.

°

*******

In the case of oil, discovery, in the very nature of things, would rarely or never be

made except at the end of much time and after the expenditure of much money, the

discovery of oil involving the erection of a derrick and the laborious drilling of a well,

frequently to the depth of 3,000 feet and more. * * « ;:- * # *

But it is always to be borne in mind that, until the perfection of the inchoate and

incomplete location by discovery, the locator has, first, no vested rights which Con-

gress is obliged to recognize.

In the case of Mining Co. v. Tunnel Co. (196 U. S., 337) the Supreme Court of the United States stated the matter clearly and forcefully:

Three things are provided for, discovery, location and patent. The first is the primary, the initial fact. The others are dependent upon it and are the machinery devised by Congress for securing to the discoverer of mineral the full benefit of his discovery. * * * The whole scope of the chapter is the acquisition of title from the United States to mines and mineral lands, the discovery of the mineral being, as stated, the initial fact. Without that no rights can be acquired.

And again in Waskey v. Hammer (223 U. S., 85):

The mining laws, Rev. Stat. §§ 2320, 2329, make the discovery of mineral "within the limits of the claim" a prerequisite to the location of a claim, whether lode or placer * * *.

Judge Lindley, in discussing the subject, makes the following statements (Lindley on Mines, 3d ed., § 437):

Discovery is just as essential in case of placers as it is in lode locations.1 The Supreme Court of California at one time expressed the view that neither the Federal laws nor the local rules and customs of miners required that a discovery should be made as a prerequisite to a placer location, 2 but this was obviously a mere dictum;
it was also opposed to the current of judicial authority, as was subsequently so determined by the same court.3 The land department has uniformly held that discovery is essential in the case of placers, going so far at one time as to hold that such discovery was essential in each twenty-acre tract within a location of one hundred and sixty acres located by an association of persons.
*******
In the case of petroleum deposits the courts in California have in recent years been confronted with some serious problems upon the subject of what constitutes a sufficient discovery which will sanction a location of oil lands under the laws applicable to placers. It is well known that the natural habitat of this class of mineral hydro-

carbons is in stratified rocks some distance below the surface, and except for the occasional appearance at the surface in the form of oil seepages, springs, or other indications of the subterranean existence of petroleum, there is nothing to guide the miner in making his location. It requires more or less extensive development in the nature of well-drilling and prospecting to determine the nature, extent, and permanency of the deposit.
######* Of course exploitation on adjacent lands might raise a strong presumption that a given tract contained petroleum. An oil-producing well within each of four sections of land surrounding a fifth would produce a conviction that the oil deposit was underneath the fifth section. This fact might justify the land department in classifying the section in the category of mineral lands, 1 or the government surveyor in returning it as such, 2 but it would not dispense with the necessity of making a discovery.3
What constitutes a valid discovery? Oil in large quantities is seldom if ever found in nature on the surface of the ground. The natural laws under which it accumulates require a superincumbent rock covering of considerable thickness and density. With the exception of negligible quantities gathered from seepages and springs all the oil produced in the United States conies from wells of greater or less depth, and it is only by means of such wells that discovery can be made. As stated in McLemore v. Express Oil Co. (112 Pac., 59), already quoted:
In the case of oil, discovery, in the very nature of things, would rarely or never be made except at the end of much time and after the expenditure of much money, the discovery of oil involving the erection of a derrick and the laborious drilling of a well, frequently to the depth of 3,000 feet and more.
In Miller v. Chrisman (73 Pac., 1083) the court says:
To constitute a discovery, the law requires something more than conjecture, hope, or even indications. The geological formation of the country may be such as scientific research and practical experience have shown to be likely to yield oil in paying quantities. Taken with this there may be other surface indications, such as seepage of oil. All these things combined may be sufficient to justify the expectation and hope that, upon driving a well to sufficient depth, oil may be discovered, but one and all they do not, in and of themselves, amount to a discovery. This view finds support in the Nevada Sierra Oil Co. v. Home Oil Co. (C.C.), 98 Fed., 673, where the circuit court was dealing with this precise question, in regard to this precise piece of land, under these identical circumstances. While perhaps it would be stating it too broadly to say that no case can be imagined where a surface discovery may be made of oil sufficient to fill the requirements of the statute, yet it is certainly true that no such case has ever been presented to our attention, and that in the nature of things such a case will seldom, if ever, occur.
A review of indications which have been held not to constitute discovery is given in the case of the Butte Oil Co. (40 L. D., 602), from which the following is quoted:
The question of what constitutes a discovery of oil has been considered by the various courts and the Department. In Nevada Sierra Oil Co. v. Home Oil Co. (98
i Kern Oil Co. v. Clotfelter, 33 L. D., 201; Hirshfeld v. Chrisman, 40 L. D., 112. a State of Washington v. McBride, 25 L. D., 169,181. "Reins v. Murray, 22 L. D., 409.

36 PETROLEUM WITHDRAWALS AND RESTORATIONS.
Fed. Rep., 673) the evidence showed that there had not been any seepages of oil upon the tract in controversy, but that sandstone and shale had been discovered thereon as well as on adjoining lands and that there were seepages of oil upon some of the adjoining land as well as wells on the adjoining tracts which were producing more or less oil. This was held not to constitute a discovery. Judge Boss holding that:
"But these were nothing more than indications of existing oil under the surface of the ground in question, which might or might not prove to be true. Mere indications, however strong, are not, in my opinion, sufficient to answer the requirements of the statute, which requires, as one of the essential conditions to the making of a valid location of unappropriated public land of the United States under the mining laws, a discovery of mineral within the limits of the claim."
In Olive Land & Development Co. v. Olmstead et al. (103 Fed. Rep., 568) the answer set up the following statement of facts:
"The answer avers that the land in controversy is of no agricultural value, and of. but little, if any, value for grazing purposes, and has no appreciable value for any purpose except for petroleum that may be obtained by boring or drilling therein; that it is in a well-recognized petroleum-producing belt, and that adjacent properties in the belt are actually producing petroleum in large and profitable quantities, and that the surface indications of such producing lands and upon the lands in controversy are the same; that the surface rock and sand and the surface geological formation and stratification upon the lands in controversy are such as would lead any. experienced petroleum expert or any practical geologist familiar with petroleumbearing lands in California to pronounce the same oil or petroleum territory, and chiefly valuable therefor; that one of the most pronounced and well-marked anticlinal folds of sandstone and shale formation in Ventura County runs through the land in controversy and has its apex thereon, and that where said anticlinal fold ia most exposed, by a declivity which sharply cuts the same, bituminous sand several feet in thickness and 100 or more feet long is clearly visible, which sand, when excavated, gives out a distinct odor of petroleum; that such bituminous sand, in the formation in which it is found, shows the land in controversy to be mineral or petroleum in character, and constitutes such a discovery as would justify any prudent petroleum miner in locating the same as petroleum land and in spending Ms time and money in developing the same for its petroleum product; that * * * dis-
covery of bituminous sand in said sandstone and shale formation having been made upon the land in controversy by eight persons, * * * citizens of the United States, and over the age of 21 years, they did * * * locate * * * the lands in controversy as placer petroleum lands and as a placer petroleum milling claim."
The court held that this location amounted to nothing "for the reason that no discovery of oil or other mineral had been made, nor, indeed, has yet been made."
*******
So in Bay v. Oklahoma Southern Gas, Oil & Mining Co. et al. (73 Pac. Rep., 936) the Supreme Court of Oklahoma, at page 940, expresses the same view:
"Neither will mere surface indications support a location. It is the common experience of persons of ordinary intelligence that petroleum in valuable quantities is not found on the surface of the ground, nor is it found in paying quantities seeping from the earth. Valuable oil is found by drilling or boring into the interior of the earth, and either flows or is pumped to the surface; and until some body or vein has been discovered from which the oil can be brought to the surface, it can not be considered of sufficient importance to warrant a location under the mineral laws."
In New England & Coalinga Oil Co. v. Congdon et al. (92 Pac., 180) the Supreme Court of California held that the following facts under Miller v. Chrisman, supra, did not constitute a discovery:

OIL-LAND LAW.

37

"Evidence that the land was oil bearing consisted of the testimony of plaintiff's superintendent that he had found on the land 'some oil sand stained with oil and a ridge of fossil,' and that oil had-been discovered in neighboring locations, the nearest well being some two miles distant. The geological formation indicated the probable existence of oil-bearing strata in the claim."
The Department in Southwestern Oil Co. v. Atlantic and Pacific R. R. Co. (39 L. D., 335) held (syllabus):
"The disclosure of a stratum of bituminous sandstone or shale from which a small quantity of oil seeps, not sufficient to impress the land with any value for mining purposes, does not constitute a sufficient discovery to support a valid mining location.''
In the Butte Oil Co. case, from which these quotations are taken, the alleged discoveries were stated as follows (p. 603):
Upon the Lake No. 11 the company drilled a well to the depth of 1,400 feet but struck no oil, after which it discontinued its operations in August, 1904. A small flow of natural gas, however, was developed, insufficient for commercial purposes and without value. One witness testified that by conserving the flow and using small pipes, the gas might be sufficient for a range used by a resident of the near vicinity. Upon the Excess No. 2 there was a seepage of oil beneath a large rock upon the surface of a spring of water which had stained some of the surrounding rocks. It could be skimmed off the surface and collected in a bottle, and one sample so collected by one of the Government's witnesses upon analysis proved to be petroleum oil.
The Department held (p. 606):
The slight flow of gas and the small seepage of oil were indications that there possibly is a reservoir of oil lying at an unknown depth and situated at some unknown distance from the land and can not be regarded as a discovery of oil as a basis of a placer mining location under the act of February 11,1897.
Thus it appears that no "mere surface indications," nor seepages on the claim or oh adjoining lands, nor outcrops of oil sands, even under favorable geologic conditions, nor producing wells on adjacent lands, nor gas flows too small to be of substantial value can be considered as constituting valid discovery. It is difficult to frame a definition which will cover all cases, and such a definition in advance of court or departmental interpretation should not be given much weight, but it is safe to say that a discovery, to validate an oil location under the placer law, should consist of oil or gas in sufficient quantity to justify a man of ordinary prudence in the expectation of developing such a paying supply as to make the land chiefly valuable therefor. It would perhaps seem reasonable to add, especially in view of the words of the court in Bay v. Oklahoma Southern Co., quoted above, that the discovery of oil or gas should be made at the geologic horizon from which production is expected or hoped for.
Not only is a discovery essential, but it must be made before application for patent. If it is made after the other acts of location have been performed the location will date from the time of discovery (Lindley on Mines, 3d ed., §335), but if it is made after application for patent the application is without legal foundation and can not be recognized as a basis for mineral entry or patent (Bay City Oil Co. v. Alvarado Oil Co., 43 L. D., 397).

38 PETKOLEUM WITHDRAWALS AND RESTORATIONS.
OTHER PREREQUISITES TO LOCATION AND PATENT.
UNITED STATES, EXCLUSIVE OF ALASKA.
Aside from the requirement that the locator shall be a citizen of the United States or have declared his intention to become such (R. S., 2319), the only essential to a valid location in addition to a discovery of mineral is, so far as the Federal mining law is concerned, that the claim be "distinctly marked on the ground so that its boundaries can be readily traced" (R. S., 2324). State laws and local regulations prescribe other requirements, such as posting a location notice on the claim and recording the location with a specified district or county officer. Once these requirements have been met, the locator has " the exclusive right of possession and enjoyment of all the surface included within the lines" of his claim (R. S., 2322). The claim may comprise 20 acres if located by an individual or, if made by an association, 20 acres for each member thereof (R. S., 2321), but in no case may it exceed 160 acres (R. S., 2320). There is no limit upon the number of claims which may be located by a single individual or'association.
Having complied with all the requirements necessary to a valid location, and having thus become entitled to exclusive right of possession, the claimant, in order to continue the right,' must expend not less than $100 worth of labor or improvements upon the claim during each year (R. S., 2324). Upon failure to perform the required assessment work, as this $100 worth of labor or improvements is called, the right to exclusive possession is subject to forfeiture, and the claim becomes "open to relocation in the same manner as if no location * * * had ever been made" (R. S., 2324). The present law gives the claimant until the end of the calendar year succeeding his location in which to perform his first assessment work (21 Stat., 61), and thereafter the calendar year is the period for which such work is required.
It is important to note that assessment work gives "exclusive right of possession and enjoyment" only after discovery. In Smith v. Union Oil Co. (135 Pac., 966) the Supreme Court of California says:
The word "assessment," when used in connection with the right to a mining claim, was universally understood to mean the annual labor required by that section in order to hold the right to the possession of a mining claim after a discovery and complete location had been made. 1 Snyder on Mines, § 475. It had acquired this technical meaning in mining law. It was never used or understood to indicate work done to make a discovery on a claim where none had been made. It was applied only to work done to hold a claim after discovery work that had no necessary relation to a discovery, although, of course, such work might lead to further or more comprehensive discoveries.
In an earlier case to which .reference has already been made (McLemore v. Express Oil Co., 112 Pac., 59), the same court said:

OIL-LAND LAW.

39

And a location is valid and complete only when, after compliance with other requirementa, a discovery of valuable mineral in place has been made. * * * But where the location is incomplete no question of assessment work is involved.
And again, in the case of Borgwardt v. McKittrick Oil Co. (130 Pao., 417), the same court used the following language:
Until a sufficient actual discovery of mineral is made on such a claim, a location is not perfected, and no question of the doing of annual assessment work is involved. It is only after such discovery, when actual possession is no longer necessary to protect the location against subsequent locators, that annual assessment work is essential to prevent a forfeiture.
If the claimant has made a valid discovery and has expended not less than $500 worth of labor or improvements upon the claim (E. S., 2325), he is, upon compliance with certain requirements as to application, posting notices, publication, and survey if necessary
(R. S., 2325), and upon payment of $2.50 an acre (R. S., 2333), entitled to a patent conveying a title in fee to the area covered by his claim. The right to patent may also be established by holding and working a placer claim for the period prescribed by the statute of limitations of the State in which the claim is situated (R. S., 2332).

ALASKA.
Although the act of June 6, 1900 (31 Stat., 321), provides that "the laws of the United States relating to mining claims, mineral locations, and rights incident thereto are hereby extended to the District of Alaska," the act of August 1, 1912 (37 Stat., 242), here given in full, modified the placer law in certain important particulars:
AN ACT To modify and amend the mining laws in their application to the Territory of Alaska, and for other purposes.
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, That no association placer-mining claim shall hereafter be located in Alaska in excess of forty acres, and on every placer-mining claim hereafter located in Alaska, and until a patent has been issued therefor, not less than one hundred dollars' worth of labor shall be performed or improvements made during each year, including the year of location, for each and every twenty acres or excess fraction thereof.
SEC. 2. That no person shall hereafter locate any placer-mining claim in Alaska as attorney for another unless he is duly authorized thereto by a power of attorney in writing, duly acknowledged and recorded in any recorder's office in the judicial division where the location is made. Any person so authorized may locate placermining claims for not more than two individuals or one association under such power of attorney, but no such agent or attorney shall be authorized or permitted to locate more than two placer-mining claims for any one principal or association during any calendar month, and no placer-mining claim shall hereafter be located in Alaska except under the limitations of this Act.
SEC. 3. That no person shall hereafter locate, cause or procure to be located, for himself more than two placer-mining claims in any calendar month: Provided, That one or both of such locations may be included in an association claim.

40 PETROLEUM WITHDRAWALS AND RESTORATIONS.
SEC. 4. That no placer-mining claim hereafter located in Alaska shall be patented which shall contain a greater area than is fixed by law, nor which is longer than three times its greatest width.
SEC. 5. That any placer-mining claim attempted to be located in violation of this Act shall be null and void, and the whole area thereof may be located by any qualified locator as if no such prior attempt had been made.
Thus in Alaska an association placer is limited to 40 instead of 160 acres, assessment work must amount to $100 for each 20 acres of the claim or fraction thereof instead of for the whole claim, assessment work must be performed for the calendar year during which location is made, and the number of claims which may be located on behalf of any one person in any one calendar month is limited to two.
The act of June 6, 1900, supra, also contains provisions as to recording, location notices, and the like; but these provisions, being equivalent in their nature to the enactments on similar subjects in the various States, are not here given.
STAGES OF DEVELOPMENT OF TITLE.
It is evident that there are three stages of development of the title which a claimant under the placer law acquires to the land included within his claim first, the period between his physical occupation of the claim and the perfecting of his location, which may be called the "occupancy period"; second, the period between his location and patent, which may be called the "location period"; and third, the period after patent, or "patent period."
PATENT PEEIOD.
The period after the issuance of patent requires no discussion. The patent is a grant of title in fee simple, good against the grantor and all adverse claimants, and subject to attack only upon the ground of fraud.
LOCATION PERIOD.
The character of title during the period between location and patent is such as to protect the claimant in the exclusive possession and enjoyment of his claim so long as he performs his annual assessment work and complies with State and local regulations. It is not necessary for the locator to remain in continuous possession or occupancy or to engage in diligent development work. Of the numerous authorities on this point but one will be cited. In McLemore v. Express Oil Co., supra, the court said:
When the location is valid and complete, the law exacts the doing of but $100 of work per year, and when that is done all of the locator's rights are fully protected, whether he remains in possession longer than is necessary to do that work or not.

OIL-LAND LAW.

4.1

Lindley, in reviewing the character of this estate, says (Lindley on
Mines, 3d ed., § 539):
Prior to the issuance of a patent the locator can not be said to own the fee simple title. The fee resides in the general government, whose tribunals, specially charged with the ultimate conveyance of the title, must pass upon the qualifications of the locator and his compliance with the law. Yet, as between the locator and every one else save the paramount proprietor the estate acquired by a perfected mining location possesses all the attributes of a title in fee, and so long as the requirements of the law with reference to continued development are satisfied, the character of the tenure remains that of a fee. As between the locator and the Government, the former is the owner of the beneficial estate, and the latter holds the fee in trust, to be conveyed to such beneficial owner upon his application in that behalf and in compliance with the terms prescribed by the paramount proprietor.1

OCCUPANCY PERIOD.

It should be borne clearly in mind and can not be too strongly
emphasized that the character of right and title just noted exists only after location and that no location can be made unless founded upon discovery. Until he has made discovery no amount of development work and no compliance with other Federal, State, or local requirements will confer upon the claimant an equitable estate as against the Government or a tenure in the nature of a fee against others. As against the Government, the mineral claimant who has made no discovery has in fact no estate either legal or equitable. Neither has he any vestige of title against strangers so far as the Federal statutes are concerned. Congress has, however, accorded to him whatever protection there is in the law of possession, the act of February 27, 1865 (13 Stat., 441), having been brought into the Revised Statutes as follows (R. S., 910):
No possessory action between persons, in any court of the United States, for the recovery of any mining title, or for damages to any such title, shall be affected by the fact that the paramount title to the land in which such mines lie is in the United States; but each case shall be adjudged by the law of possession.

Under this statute the mineral occupant has been granted some measure of protection, none too clearly defined, by the courts, and the measure of this protection is a matter of great concern to the prospector for deep-seated deposits. How far will the courts safeguard his occupancy and possession prior to discovery ?
One of the leading cases upon the rights of a mineral occupant against, an agricultural claimant is Cosmos Exploration Co. v. Gray Eagle Oil Co. (112 Fed., 4). "In this case, which was affirmed by the Supreme Court of the United States, although this question of occupants' rights was not specifically mentioned (190 U. S., 310), it is

stated that the defendants had made "pretended placer mining locations" upon the land in controversy but had made no discovery, that thereafter complainant selected this land in lieu of certain lands in the national forest under the act of June 4, 1897 (30 Stat., 11, 36), which provides for the selection of " vacant land open to settlement," and that subsequently defendants discovered oil in paying quantities. The circuit court of appeals of the ninth circuit held (syllabus):
Land was not" vacant and open to settlement" and subject to selection under such act where at the time of the application it was in the actual occupancy of others engaged in exploring it for oil, under oil placer mining locations previously made by them, although such locations did not appear by the records of the local land office, and although they were not valid as against the United States, because there had been no previous discovery of oil on the land, where the locators prosecuted the work of exploration with due diligence, and with the result of discovering oil in paying quantities before the selection by[the applicant under the forest reserve act had been approved by the land department. Until by such approval an applicant is vested with the equitable title to the land, it remains subject to exploration for minerals under the mining laws; and while lawfully occupied by one engaged in making such exploration it is not "vacant" within the meaning of the act, nor is it open to settlement where, as the result of such exploration, its mineral character is established, while the title, both legal and equitable, remains in the United States.
It should, however, be noted that while under this decision the prospector proceeding in good faith to explore for minerals is protected against adverse agricultural claimants, there is nothing of record in the Land Office to show that the land which he occupies is not "vacant and open to settlement," and such agricultural filings are likely to be made at any time, subjecting him to the expense of maintaining contest proceedings before the Land Department or the courts. It is also important to note that oil was discovered before the agricultural selection had been approved, and that when the agricultural selection was made the mineral claimants were in diligent prosecution of work leading to discovery.
That in default of diligent and continuous exploratory work there is no protection against agricultural filing is shown by the decisions in McLemore v. Express Oil Co. (112 Pac., 59) and Hirshfeld v. Chrisman (40 L. D., 112). The salient points of the former case are quoted below. In the latter case the Department held:
Such mere paper locations, upon which no discovery of oil has been made and upon which the mineral claimants are not prosecuting with diligence the work for making a discovery of oil, do not prevent appropriation by soldiers' additional homestead entry. * * * these lands were unappropriated, public lands * * *.
That a measure of protection is afforded against adverse claimants, mineral or agricultural, who attempt by forcible, fraudulent, or surreptitious means to violate the possession of a mineral occupant proceeding diligently and in good faith to make discovery is held in McLemore v. Express Oil Co. (112 Pac., 59), already quoted, in

OIL-LAND LAW.

which the Supreme Court of California also outlines the necessity for such pro tection:
As has been said, in the case of other minerals discovery preceded the demarkation of the boundaries, the posting and recording of the notice. In the case of oil, discovery, in the very nature of things, would rarely or never be made except at the end of much time and after the expenditure of much money, the discovery of oil involving the erection of a derrick and the laborious drilling of a well, frequently to the depth of 3,000 feet and more. If, therefore, the placer mining lawa, which were declared by Congress to be the only laws under which oil locations could be established, were to be made of any practical benefit to the oil locator, it must be by permitting him to mark the boundaries of his location and post and record his notice, and protect him in possession while he was with diligence prosecuting the labor of digging his well to determine whether or not a discovery could be made. So it was held by the Federal courts, by the courts of some of the other States, and by this court in Miller v. Chrisman, 140 Cal., 447, 73 Pac., 1084, 74 Pac., 444, 98 Am. St. Rep., 63, to the following effect; "One who thus in good faith makes his location, remains in possession and with
due diligence prosecutes his work toward a discovery, is fully protected against all forms of forcible, fraudulent, surreptitious, or clandestine entries and intrusions O upon his possession. Such entry must be always peaceable, open and above board, and made in good faith, or no right can be founded upon it." Weed v. Snook, 144 Cal., 439, 77 Pac., 1023; Cosmosetc., Co. v. Gray Eagle Oil Co. (C. C.) 104 Fed., 20; IdM 112 Fed., 4, 50 C. C. A., 79, 61 L. R. A., 230; Id., 190 U. S., 301,23 Sup. Ct., 692,47 L. Ed., 1064; Whiting v. Straup, 17 Wyo., 1, 95 Pac., 849,129 Am. St. Rep., 1093; Moffatv. Blue River, etc., Co., 33 Colo., 142,80 Pac., 139. But it is always to be borne in mind that, until the perfection of the inchoate and incomplete location by discovery, the locator has, first, no vested rights which Congress is obliged to recognize. So that Congress may change its policy in regard to the lands to the extent even of excluding therefrom the diligent operator who has not made discovery. However inequitable such a proceeding might be, it in no way would be illegal.
*******
What the attempting locator has is the right to continue in possession, undisturbed by any form of hostile or clandestine entry, while he is diligently prosecuting hia work to a discovery.
Miller v. Chrisman (73 Pac., 1083) is a leading case of such importance that an extract more ample than that included in the decision
just quoted is here given:
It is to be remembered that it is not essential to the validity of a location that the discovery shall have preceded or shall coexist with the posting of the notice and the demarkation of boundaries. The discovery may be made subsequently, and when made operates to perfect the location against all the world, saving those whose bona fide rights have intervened. One who thus in good faith makes his location, remains in possession, and with due diligence prosecutes his work toward a discovery, is fully protected against all forms of forcible, fraudulent, surreptitious, or clandestine entries and intrueions upon his possession. Such entry must always be peaceable, open, and above board, and made in good faith, or no right can be founded upon it. Belk v. Meagher, 104 U. S., 279, 26 L. Ed., 735; Atherton v. Fowler, 96 U. S., 513, 24 L. Ed. 732; Nevada Sierra Oil Co. v. Home Oil Co., supra. . * * *
It further appears that certain valuable rights become the property of such locators even before discovery. They have the right of possession against all intruders (Garthe v. Hart, 73 Cal., 541, 15 Pac., 93), and they may defend this possession in the courts (Richardson v. McNulty, 24 Cal., 339). They have then this right of posses-

44 PETROLEUM WITHDRAWALS AND RESTORATION'S.
sion, and with it the right to protect their possession against all intrusions, and to work the land for the valuable minerals it is thought to contain. We can not perceive why these rights may not in good faith be made the subject of conveyance by the associates as well before as after discovery.
The same court discusses the matter at some length in Borgwardt v. McKittrick Oil Co. (130 Pac., 417):
The rights of the person or persons endeavoring to locate an oil claim, after the posting of notice, etc., are well settled by the decisions. Until the inchoate location is perfected by discovery, the locator has no vested right which Congress is obliged to recognize. But where his location is made in good faith, he has the right, as against third persons, which is transferable, "to be protected against all forms of forcible, fraudulent, surreptitious, or clandestine entries and intrusions upon his possession," so long as he "remains in possession and with due diligence prosecutes his work toward a discovery." Miller v. Chrisman, 140 Cal., 440, 447, 73 Pac., 1084, 98 Am. St. Rep., 63; Weed v. Snook, 144 Cal., 439, 77 Pac., 1023. As long as such a condition continues, no one, without his consent, can make the actual entry of the land essential to legally initiate a new location. But actual possession of the land, coupled with continued diligent prosecution of discovery work, are essential to his protection. "What the attempting locator has is the right to continue in possession, undisturbed ' by any form of hostile or clandestine entry, while he is diligently prosecuting his work to a discovery." McLemore v. Express Oil Co., 158 Cal., 559, 112 Pac., 59,139 Am. St. Rep., 147. "Where the alleged locator has not made a discovery, and has not retained possession for the purpose of prosecuting work looking to a discovery, his mere posting of notice and marking of boundaries upon the ground will not serve to exclude others who may peaceably enter upon the land which he is not actually working or occupying." New England, etc., Oil Co. v. Congdon, 152 Cal., 211, 214, 92 Pac., 180, 181.
* .* * * * * # The requirement of diligent prosecution of the work was described in McLemore v. Express Oil Co., supra, as follows: "This diligent prosecution of the work of discovery does not mean the doing of assessment work. It does not mean the pursuit of capital to prosecute the work. It does not mean any attempted holding, by cabin, lumber pile, or unused derrick. It means the diligent, continuous prosecution of the Work, with the expenditure of whatever money may be necessary to the end in view." It is only one so actually possessed and so engaged in the diligent prosecution of the work of discovery who is thus protected, by reason of his attempted location, against an entry by another.
In a still more recent case (Smith v. Union Oil Co., 135 Pac., 966) the same court says:
If a qualified person peaceably enters upon public lands of the United States for the purpose of discovering oil or other valuable mineral deposits therein, and such land is at the time unoccupied, and there is at the time no valid mineral location or lawful entry thereon, under the land laws of the United States, such person has the right to continue in possession so long as he continues to occupy the same to the exclusion of others, and diligently and in good faith prosecutes thereon the work of endeavoring to discover such mineral therein.
The circuit court of appeals for the ninth circuit, in Rooney v. Barnette (200 Fed., 700), goes still further, saying:
The location of mineral ground gives to the locator before discovery, and while he complies <with the statutes of the United States and the state and local rules and

OIL-LAND LAW.

-

45

regulations, the valuable right of possession against all intruders, and this right he can convey to another.
This affirmation of a right of possession as against all intruders, however, is predicated upon a quotation from Swanson v. Kettler (105 Pac., 1059), in which there had been a discovery.
Although from these decisions it appears that a mineral claimant prior to discovery may not be ousted from his possession by force or fraud, so long as he is diligently engaged in the prosecution of work leading to discovery, it has been held repeatedly that his posssssion is not good against that of an adverse claimant who enters upon the land in good faith and in compliance with the law and proceeds to make a discovery. The quotations from Miller v. Chrisman given above confirm this by implication and cite among others the case of Garthe v. Hart (73 Cal., 541). In this case the court below had
instructed the jury as follows:
As I said, there is still another way by which a miner in this State may acquire a right to the possession of a piece of mining ground. It is by taking possession of it and clearly defining the boundaries so that they may be readily traced, and holding such possession, keeping such possession.
The appellate court, reversed the lower court on this and other grounds, saying:
In the hurry of the trial, the learned judge evidently overlooked the distinction between the right of a party in possession as against mere intruders, and his right as against one who has complied with the mining laws. Possession is good against mere intruders (Attwood v. Fricot, 17 Cal., 37; S. C., 76 Am. Dec., 567; English v. Johnson, 17 Cal., 115; S. C., 76 Am. Dec., 574; Hess v. Winder, 30 Cal., 355; Golden Fleece Co. v. Cable Con. Co., 12 Nev., 321, 322); butitis not good as against one who has complied with the mining laws. (Du Prat v. James, 65 Cal., 556, 557.)
In Miller v. Chrisman, supra, the Supreme Court also cited the leading case of Belk v. Meagher (104 U. S., 279). In this case, which is not as clear or simple as might be wished, the facts were stated to be as follows (syllabus):
A entered December 19, 1876, upon a claim not then in the actual possession of any one, but covered by a valid and subsisting location which did not expire until the 1st day of January thereafter. Between the date of his entry and February 21, 1877, he made no improvements or inclosure, and did a very small amount of work, but had no other title than such as arose from his attempted location of the claim and his occasional labor upon it. On the last-mentioned date B entered upon the property peaceably and in good faith, and did all that was required to protect his right to the exclusive possession thereof. A brought ejectment October 25,1877. Held, that A's entry and labor did not entitle him to a patent under sec. 2332, Rev. Stat., nor prevent B's acquisition of title to the claim * * *.
The court, through Mr. Chief Justice Waite, said:
No one contends that the defendants effected their entry and secured their relocation by force. They knew what Belk had done and what he was doing. He had no right to the possession, and was only on the land at intervals. There was no inclosure,

46 PETROLEUM WITHDRAWALS AND RESTORATIONS.
and he had made no improvements. He apparently exercised no other acts of ownership, after January 1, than every explorer of the mineral lands of the United States does when he goes on them and uses his pick to search for and examine lodes and yeins. As his attempted relocation was invalid, his rights were no more than those of a simple explorer. In two months he had done, as he himself says,'' no hard work on the claim,'' and he'' probably put two days' work on the ground.'' This was the extent of his possession. He was not an original discoverer, but he sought to avail himself of what others had found. Relying on what he had done in December, he did not do what was necessary to effect a valid relocation after January 1. His possession might have been such as would have enabled him to bring an action of trespass against one who entered without any color of right, but it was not enough, as we think, to prevent an entry peaceably and in good faith for the purpose of securing a right under the act of Congress to the exclusive possession and enjoyment of the property. The defendants having got into possession and perfected a relocation, have secured the better right.
The court also said:
His ultimate right to a patent depended entirely on his keeping himself in and all others out, and if he was not actually in, he was in law out. A peaceable adverse entry, coupled with the right to hold the possession which was thereby acquired, operated as an ouster. * * * He had made no such location as prevented the lands from being in law vacant. Others had the right to enter for the purpose of taking them up, if it could be done peaceably and without force. There is nothing in Atherton v. Fowler (96 U. S., 513) to the contrary of this.
This doctrine has been followed in many cases (Lindley on Mines, 3d ed., § 218, footnote No. 25). In ThaUman v. Thomas (111 Fed., 277), the circuit court of appeals for the eighth circuit said:
But every competent locator has the right to initiate a lawful claim to unappropriated public land by a peaceable adverse entry upon it while it is in the possession of those who have no superior right to acquire the title or to hold the possession. * * * Any other rule would make the wrongful occupation of public land by a trespasser superior in right to a lawful entry of it under the acts of Congress by a competent locator.
In Crossman v. Pendery (8 Fed., 693), it was held:
A prospector on the public mineral domain may protect himself in the possession of his pedis possessionis while he is searching for mineral. His possession so held is good as a possessory title against all the world, except the Government of the United States. But if he stands by and allows others to enter upon his claim and first discover mineral in rock in place, the law gives such first discoverer a title to the mineral so first discovered, against which the mere possession of the surface can not prevail * * *.
Lindley summarizes the matter as follows (Lindley on Mines, 3d ed., §219):
(1) Actual possession of a tract of public mineral land is valid as against a mere intruder, or one having no higher or better right than the prior occupant;
(2) No mining right or title can be initiated by a violent or forcible invasion of another's actual occupancy;
(3) If a party goes upon the mineral lands of the United States and either establishes a settlement or works thereon without complying with the requirements of the mining laws, and relies exclusively upon his possession or work, a second party who locates peaceably a mining claim covering any portion of the same ground, and in all respects complies with the requirements of the mining laws, is entitled to the posses-

OIL-LAND LAW.

47

eion of such mineral ground to the extent of his location as against the prior occupant,

who is, from the time said second party has perfected his location and complied with

the law, a trespasser.

'*

To this the following further summary may well be added: 1. A claimant who remains in continuous possession and diligently prosecutes work leading to discovery will be protected against forcible, fraudulent, clandestine, or surreptitious entry or intrusion upon his possession perhaps (Borgwardt v. McKittrick Oil Co., supra) against any entry or intrusion made without his consent. As to whether this protection extends to the limits of the claim or is confined to the pedis possessio the part of the claim actually covered by possession and diligent work the 'courts are not in agreement. 2. If possession is not continuous or work leading to discovery is
not diligently prosecuted adverse entry may be made.
3. If a claimant, though in possession and in diligent prosecution
of work leading to discovery, allows another claimant to enter upon the claim and there attempt to discover mineral, the claimant first making discovery will, if he has otherwise complied with the law, have a valid location and the unsuccessful claimant will be in trespass.
4. It is not altogether clear what means a prior occupant may take and to what extent he may go in preventing the peaceable and open entry which will, if it ripen into a valid location, dispossess him.
5. Some of the public-land States have enacted laws regarding occupancy prior to discovery, providing, for example, for the recording of claims, or attempting to provide a period during which the occupant may have exclusive possession in order to make discovery. For the interpretation and effect of these statutes or of local decisions regarding rights of occupancy recourse must be had to local authorities.

THE "FIVE CLAIMS ACT" OF FEBRUARY 12, 1903.
An act known as the "five claims act," making certain provisions as to assessment work under the placer law, was approved February 12, 1903 (32 Stat., 825), and is as follows:
AN ACT Defining what shall constitute and providing for assessments on oil mining claims.
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, That where oil lands are located under the provisions of title thirty-two, chapter six, Revised Statutes of the United States, as placer mining claims, the annual assessment labor upon such claims may be done upon any one of a group of claims lying contiguous and owned by the same person or corporation, not exceeding five claims in all: Provided, That said labor will tend to the development or to determine the oil-bearing character of such contiguous claims.
It must be remembered in reading this act that, as already pointed out, assessment work is involved only after discovery, so that prior to discovery this act has no application there must be a discovery

48 PETEOLEUM WITHDRAWALS AND RESTORATIONS.
on each of the five claims. To quote again from the Supreme Court of California in Smith v. Union Oil Co. (135 Pac., 966), in which the disputed claim was an association placer of 160 acres:
* * * the phrase "annual assessment labor," found in the .act of 1903 under consideration, can not be construed to include or refer to work done upon a claim to accomplish a discovery thereon in order to perfect the location. The use of that phrase limits the application of the act to claims Upon which discovery has been made claims upon which there has been a valid and completed location.
THE "ASSIGNMENT'ACT" OF MARCH 2, 1911.
(36 Stat., 1015.)
AN ACT To protect the locators in good faith of oil and gas lands who shall have effected an actual discovery of oil or gas on the public lands of the United States, or their successors in interest.
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, That in no case shall patent be denied to or for any lands heretofore located or claimed under the mining laws of the United States containing petroleum, mineral oil, or gas solely because of any transfer or assignment thereof or of any interest or interests therein by the original locator or locators, or any of them, to any qualified persons or person, or corporation, prior to discovery of oil or gas therein, but if such claim is in all other respects valid and regular, patent therefor not exceeding one hundred and sixty acres in any one claim shall issue to the holder or holders thereof, as in other cases: Provided, however, That such lands were not at the time of inception of development on or under such claim withdrawn from mineral entry.
It is to be noted that this act provides for the issuance of patent only if the " claim is in all other respects valid and regular." It does not validate claims made by "dummies" or otherwise in contravention of the spirit of the mining laws. The Government may inquire into the. interest of each locator and where such interest is insufficient may refuse patent in the same manner as if the act had not been passed. It should be noted also that the act is exclusively retrospective and has no bearing en claims initiated after March 2,
1911.
WITHDRAWAL ACTS.
All oil withdrawals now outstanding are under the authority of the act of June 25, 1910 (36 Stat., 847), as amended by the act of August 24, 1912 (37 Stat., 497). The law as amended is as follows:
AN ACT To authorize the President of the United States to make withdrawals of public lands in certain cases.
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, That the President may, at any time in his discretion, temporarily withdraw from settlement, location, sale, or entry any of the public lands of the United States including the District of Alaska and reserve the same for waterpower sites, irrigation, classification of lands, or other public purposes to be specified in the orders of withdrawals, and such withdrawals or reservations shall remain in force until revoked by him or by an Act of Congress.
SEC. 2. That all lands withdrawn under the provisions of this Act shall at all times be open to exploration, discovery, occupation, and purchase under the mining laws of the United States, so far as the same apply to metalliferous minerals: Provided,

OIL-LAND LAW.

49

That the rights of any person who, at the date of any order of withdrawal heretofore or hereafter made, is a bona fide occupant or claimant of oil or gas bearing lands and who, at such date, is in the diligent prosecution of work leading to the discovery of oil or gas, shall not be affected or impaired by such order so long as such occupant or claimant shall continue in diligent prosecution of said work: Provided further, That this Act shall not be construed as a recognition, abridgment, or enlargement of any asserted rights or claims initiated upon any oil or gas bearing lands after any withdrawal of such lands made prior to June twenty-fifth, nineteen hundred and ten: And providedfurther, That there shall be excepted from the force and effect of any withdrawal made under the provisions of this Act all lands which are, on the date of such withdrawal, embraced in any lawful homestead or desert-land entry theretofore made, or upon which any valid settlement has been made and is at said date being maintained and perfected pursuant to law; but the terms of this proviso shall not continue to apply to any particular tract- of land unless the entryman or settler shall continue to comply with the law under which the entry or settlement was made: And provided further, That hereafter no forest reserve shall be created, nor shall any additions be made to one heretofore created, within the limits of the States of California, Oregon, Washington, Idaho, Montana, Colorado, or Wyoming, except by Act of Congress.
SEC. 3. That the Secretary of the Interior shall report all such withdrawals to Congress at the beginning of its next regular session after the date of the withdrawals.
The black-face type has been introduced to indicate the material changes made by the amending act. These were the substitution of the words "metalliferous minerals" for the words "minerals other than coal, oil, gas, and phosphates"1 in the first clause of section 2 and the introduction of " California" into the last proviso of section 2.
Prior to the passage of the act of June 25, 1910, withdrawals were made under the executive authority of the President,2 and the first proviso to section 2 of the act is so drawn as to apply to withdrawals both theretofore and thereafter made. . Thus in the case of L. W. Lowell et al. (40 L. D., 303) it was held (syllabus):
A placer location of oil lands, not preceded by discovery, and upon which no work which led to the discovery of oil was being prosecuted at the date of departmental withdrawal No. 5 of September 27, 1909, does not except the land covered thereby from the force and effect of such withdrawal, regardless of the subsequent discovery of oil thereon.
It is evident that many .questions will arise as to what constitutes "diligent prosecution of work leading to the discovery of oil or gas." In McLemore v. Express Oil Co. (112 Pac., 59), already cited many times, is perhaps the clearest judicial expression. The facts as stated by the court were:
A cabin was constructed upon the claim, its boundaries were marked, some bits of road built, and, in the language of appellant's brief, work had been done and improvements made upon the claim "far in excess of the requirements of the United States statutes with respect to assessment work, and before any claim had been ini-

tiated by the plaintiff .they had expended in a direct and legitimate way many times over the amount required in the way of assessment work."
The court held:
This diligent prosecution of the work of discovery does not mean the doing of assessment work! It does not mean the pursuit of capital to prosecute the work. It does not mean any attempted holding by cabin, lumber pile, or unused derrick. It means the diligent, continuous prosecution of the work, with the expenditure of whatever money may be necessary to the end in view. Of such work defendant's grantors were not in the prosecution up to April 12, 1907. They were not only not in the actual possession of the land, as the court finds, but the evidence discloses that what they had done was no more than an attempt to hold the land under the theory that assessment work was adequate for that purpose.
SEPARATION ACTS.
The withdrawals, especially those from all entry, beginning with that of September 27, 1909, inevitably included some lands having agricultural value and brought a demand for legislation which would permit agricultural development without loss of the objects for which the withdrawals were inaugurated. The first step in this direction was the "Utah act" of August 24, 1912 (37 Stat., 496), which was as follows:
AN ACT To provide for agricultural entries on oil and gas lands.
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, That from and after the passage of this Act unreserved public lands of the United States in the State of Utah, which have been withdrawn or classified as oil lands, or are valuable for oil, shall be subject to appropriate entry under the homestead laws by actual settlers only, the desert-land law, to selection by the State of Utah under grants made by Congress and under section four of the Act approved August eighteenth, eighteen hundred and ninety-four, known as the Carey Act, and to withdrawal under the Act approved June seventeenth, nineteen hundred and two, known as the reclamation Act, and to disposition in the discretion of the Secretary of the Interior under the law providing for the sale of isolated or disconnected tracts of public lands, whenever such entry, selection, or withdrawal shall be made with a view of obtaining or passing title, with a reservation to the United States of the oil and gas in such lands and of the right to prospect for, mine, and remove the same. But no desert entry made under the provisions of this Act shall contain more than one hundred and sixty acres: Provided, That those who have initiated nonmineral entries, selections, or locations in good faith, prior to the passage of this Act, on lands withdrawn or classified as oil lands, may perfect the same under the provisions of the laws under which said entries were made, but shall receive the limited patent provided for in this Act.
SEC. 2. That any person desiring to make entry under the homestead laws or the desert-land law, and the State of Utah desiring to make selection under section four of the Act of August eighteenth, eighteen hundred and ninety-four, known as the Carey Act, or under grants made by Congress, and the Secretary of the Interior in withdrawing under the reclamation Act lands classified as oil lands, or valuable for oil, with a view of securing or passing title to the same in accordance with the provisions of said Acts, shall state in the application for entry, selection, or notice of withdrawal that the same is made in accordance with and subject to the provisions and reservations of this Act.

OIL-LAND LAW.

51

SEC. 3. That upon satisfactory proof of full compliance with the provisions of the laws under which entry is made and of this Act the entryman shall be entitled to a patent to the land entered by him, which patent shall contain a reservation to the United States of all the oil and gas in the lands so patented, together with the right to prospect for, mine, and remove the same upon rendering compensation to the patentee for all damages that may be caused by prospecting for and removing such oil or gas. The reserved oil and gas deposits in such lands shall be disposed of only as shall be hereafter expressly directed by law.
A few months later provision was made for State selections in the State of Idaho by the act of February 27, 1913 (37 Stat., 687):
AN ACT To provide for selection by the State of Idaho of phosphate and oil lands.
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, That from and after the passage of this Act unreserved public lands of the United States in the State of Idaho which have been withdrawn or classified as phosphate or oil lands, or are valuable for phosphates or oil, shall, if otherwise
available under existing law, be subject to selection by the State of Idaho under indemnity and other land grants made to it by Congress whenever such selections shall be made with a view of obtaining or passing title, with a reservation to the United States of the phosphates and oil in such lands, and of the right to prospect for, mine, and remove the same.
SEC. 2. That the State of Idaho, when applying to select lands classified as phosphate or oil lands, or valuable for phosphates or oil, with a view to securing or passing title to the same in accordance with the provisions of the indemnity and other granting Acts, shall state in the application for selection that same is made in accordance with and subject to the provisions and reservations of this Act.
SEC. 3. That upon satisfactory proof of full compliance with the provisions of the laws under which selection is made and this Act, the State shall, upon approval of the selection by the Secretary of the Interior, be entitled to have the lands certified to it, with a reservation to the United States of all the phosphates and oil in the land so certified, together with the right in the United States, or persons authorized by it, to prospect for, mine, and remove the same; but before any person not acting for the United States shall be entitled to enter upon the lands certified for the purpose of prospecting for phosphates or oil he shall furnish, subject to approval by the Secretary of the Interior, a bond or undertaking as security for the payment of all damages to the crops and improvements on said lands by reason of such prospecting for phosphates or oil. Any person who has acquired from the United States the oil or phosphate deposits in any such land, or the right to mine or remove the same, may reenter and occupy so much of the surface thereof as may be required for all purposes reasonably incident to the mining and removal of the oil or phosphate therefrom and mine and remove the oil or phosphate upon payment of the damages caused thereby to the owner thereof, or upon giving a good and sufficient bond or undertaking in an action instituted in any competent court to ascertain and fix said damages: Provided, That nothing herein contained shall be held to deny or abridge the right of the State of Idaho to present and have prompt consideration of applications to select lands, which have been classified as oil or phosphate lands, with a view to disproving such classification and 'securing a certificate without reservation: And providedfurther, That the reserved phosphate and oil deposits in approved selections under this Act shall not be subject to exploration or entry, other than by the United States, except as hereinafter authorized by Congress.

fied, or valuable for oil, gas, and certain other minerals. This important law is as follows:
AN ACT To provide for agricultural entry of lands withdrawn, classified, or reported as containing phosphate, nitrate, potash, oil, gas, or asphaltic minerals.
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America <in Congress assembled, That lands withdrawn or classified as phosphate, nitrate, potash, oil, gas, or asphaltic minerals, or which are valuable for those deposits, shall be subject to appropriation, location, selection, entry, or purchase, if otherwise available, under the nonmineral land laws of the United States, whenever such location, selection, entry, or purchase shall be made with a view of obtaining or passing title with a reservation to the United States of the deposits on account of which the lands were withdrawn or classified or reported as valuable, together with the right to prospect for, mine, and remove the same; but no desert entry made under the provisions of this Act shall contain more than one hundred and sixty acres: Provided, That all applications to locate, select, enter, or purchase under this section shall state that the same are made in accordance with and subject to the provisions and reservations of this Act.
SEC. 2. That upon satisfactory proof of full compliance with the provisions of the laws under which the location, selection, entry, or purchase is made, the locator, selector, entryman, or purchaser shall be entitled to a patent to the land located, selected, entered, or purchased, which patent shall contain a reservation to the United States of the deposits on account of which the lands so patented were withdrawn or classified or reported as valuable, together with the right to prospect for, mine, and remove the same, such deposits to be subject t<!f disposal by the United States only as shall be hereafter expressly directed by law. Any person qualified to acquire the reserved deposits may enter upon said lands with a view of prospecting for the same upon the approval by the Secretary of the Interior of a bond or undertaking to be filed with him as security for the payment of all damages to the crops and improvements on such lands by reason of such prospecting, the measure of any such damage to be fixed by agreement of parties or by a court of competent jurisdiction. Any person who has acquired from the United States the title to or the right to mine and remove the reserved deposits, should the United States dispose of the mineral deposits in lands, may reenter and occupy so much of the surface thereof as may be required for all purposes reasonably incident to the mining and removal of the minerals therefrom, and mine and remove such minerals, upon payment of damages caused therejby to the owner of the land, or upon giving a good and sufficient bond or undertaking therefor in an action instituted in any competent court to ascertain and fix said damages: Provided, That nothing herein contained shall be held to deny or abridge the right to present and have prompt consideration of applications to locate, select, enter, or purchase, under the land laws of the United States, lands which have been withdrawn or classified as phosphate, nitrate, potash, oil, gas, or asphaltic mineral lands, with a view of disproving such classification and securing patent without reservation, nor shall persons who have located, selected, entered, or purchased lands subsequently withdrawn, or classified as valuable for said mineral deposits, be debarred from the privilege of showing, at any time before final entry, purchase, or approval of selection or location, that the lands entered, selected, or located are in fact nonmineral in character.
SEC. 3. That any person who has, in good faith, located, selected, entered, or purchased, or any person who shall hereafter locate, select, enter, or purchase, under the nonmineral land laws of the United States, any lands which are subsequently withdrawn, classified, or reported as being valuable for phosphate, nitrate, potash, oil, gas, or asphaltic minerals, may, upon application therefor, and making satisfactory

proof of compliance with the laws under which such lands are claimed, receive a patent therefor, which patent shall contain a reservation to the United States of all deposits on account of which the lands were withdrawn, classified, or reported as being valuable, together with the right to prospect for, mine, and remove the same.

THE BELIEF ACT OF AUGUST 25, 1914.
Litigation and uncertainty over oil claims on withdrawn lands whose validity or right to patent had been or was likely to be called in question made it difficult if not impossible for the operators of such claims to market their oil. Purchasing companies were afraid to take it lest, if the claims should be declared invalid, they might be made codefendants in suits to recover its value. On the other hand, fear of being drained by wells on adjoining lands and of ruining wells already producing made the operators loath to suspend production. The producers who found themselves in this position and they are a considerable number, especially in California requested that the Secretary of the Interior be given authority to permit production to continue on claims of this class pending determination of their validity, the oil or the proceeds therefrom to be disposed of as he should direct. In partial response to this demand the following act was passed by Congress and approved on August 25, 1914 (38.Stat., 708):
AN ACT To amend an act entitled "An act to protect the locators in good faith of oil and gas lands who shall have effected an actual discovery of oil or gas on the public lands of the United States, or their successors in interest," approved March second, nineteen hundred and eleven.
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, That an Act entitled "An Act to protect the locators in good faith of oil and gas lands who shall have effected an actual discovery of oil or gas on the public lands of the United States, or their successors in interest," approved March second, nineteen hundred and eleven, be amended by adding thereto the following section:
"SEC. 2. That where applications for patents have been or may hereafter be offered for any oil or gas land included in an order of withdrawal upon which oil or gas has heretofore been discovered, or is being produced, or upon which drilling operations were in actual progress on October third, nineteen hundred and ten, and oil or gas is thereafter discovered thereon, and where there has been no final determination by the Secretary of the Interior upon such applications for patent, said Secretary, in his discretion, may enter into agreements, under such conditions as he may prescribe with such applicants for patents in possession of such land or any portions thereof, relative to the disposition of the oil or gas produced therefrom or the proceeds thereof, pending final determination of the title thereto by the Secretary of the Interior, or such other disposition of the same as may be authorized by law. Any money which may accrue to the United States under the provisions of this Act from lands within the Naval Petroleum-Reserves shall be set; aside for the needs of the Navy and deposited in the Treasury to the credit of a fund to be known as the Navy Petroleum Fund, which fund shall be applied to the needs of the Navy as Congress may from time to time direct, by appropriation or otherwise."
As this act leaves to the Secretary of the Interior the nature of the action to be taken, the Department's regulations under it are

almost as important as the act itself, and they are here given (43 L. D., 459, approved Nov. 21, 1914):

RELATION OP GAS TO THE OIL LAWS.

In view of the fact that the "petroleum act" of February 11, 1897,

does not mention gas (the "five claims act" of February 12, 1903, also

fails to mention gas), two recent letters are of interest as indicating

the practice of considering gas as included where oil alone is named.

None of the withdrawal orders have specified natural gas, although

it is mentioned in some of the recommendation letters transmitting

the orders. The question was raised whether gas should be reserved

to the United States in patents issued for withdrawn lands under the

act of July 17, 1914. The following letter resulted:

APRIL 26, 1915.

DEAR MR. COMMISSIONER:

I inclose herewith communication from the Director of the Geological Survey, with

respect to patents under the nonmineral laws for lands included within the limits of

petroleum withdrawals, act July 17,1914 (38 Stat., 509).

The act in question authorizes the allowance of nonmineral entries, selections, and

locations upon lands withdrawn or classified as containing phosphate, nitrate, potash,

oil, gas, or asphaltic minerals, patents when issued to contain a reservation to the

United States

of the deposits on account of which the lands so patented were withdrawn, classified,

or reported as valuable * * *

As stated by the Director, there is such an intimate association and relation between

oil and natural gas that lands withdrawn because of their oil deposits were also with-

drawn because of their gas content, and I agree with the conclusion of the Director

that every oil withdrawal constitutes a report that the lands withdrawn are also

valuable for their deposits of gas. Under these circumstances, the reservation in-

serted in the patents above described should mention both oil and gas.

Cordially yours,

Bo SWEENEY,

The COMMISSIONER

Assistant Secretary.

OF THE GENERAL LAND OFFICE.

ORDERS AND CORRESPONDENCE.

59

The second letter is with regard to an application for a gas-pipe line under the act of May 21, 1896 (29 Stat.', 127), which provides "that the right of way through the public lands * * * is hereby granted to any pipe line company or corporation formed for the purpose of transporting oils, crude or refined." The Commissioner, in a letter dated April 5, 1915, approved by the Secretary on April 24, 1915, says:
While the Wyoming and Colorado acts do not specifically grant gas pipe lines, I am inclined to believe, in view of the close analogy between the oil and natural gas industries, at least in so far as the production is concerned, that it would not be a forced construction of the act to hold it as applicable to gas pipe lines as well as to oil pipe lines.
ORDERS AND CORRESPONDENCE. »
Under this heading orders of withdrawal, restoration, and modi-
fication are arranged according to dates of final approval, which do not invariably, especially in the later orders, correspond to the dates of recommendation. For example, Petroleum Reserve No. 32 was recommended by the Geological Survey on April 30, 1914, was forwarded by the Secretary of the Interior to the President on May 5, 1914, and was approved by the President on May 6, 1914. It is placed here under the date on which it became an effective order, and is headed, "Withdrawal of May 6, 1914." Other correspondence is, of course, given under dates of writing. The headings have been kept down to the smallest useful length and are suggestive rather than explanatory.
Letterheads have been omitted. Unless otherwise indicated, all letters and orders are dated Washington, D. C.

Commissioner, General Land Office,

Washington, D. C. SIR:

We have the honor to report that petroleum or coal oil, has recently been discovered

uppn portions of the public lands lying in T. 2 S., Us. 1, 2, and 3 W., also T. IS.,

R. 2 W., Humboldt Meridian, the last recently surveyed under Act of Congress ap-

proved May 30, 1862. We are under the impression from all we can gather relative

thereto, that petroleum or coal oil deposits in that section are.extensive, and destined

to become valuable.

In the absence of instructions or precedents applicable to cases of this kind we

have thought it best to report the fact of such discoveries, and would respectfully

ask for instructions thereto.

GENTLEMEN:

I have received your Report of the 5th of January last, 1 stating that "Petroleum or

Coal Oilhas recently been discovered upon portions of the public lands lying in

T. 2 S., Rs. 1, 2 and 3 W., also T. 1 S. R. 2 W., Humboldt Meridian, the last recently

.

At same-time you enclose Slips on the subject "found in the Sacramento Union,

relative to the subject of this letter."

It is not the policy of the Government to deal with Petroleum tracts as ordinary

public lands, any more than with auriferous or other mineral or saline lands. Hence,

you will report the exact description of any and all tracts strictly of the character

you mention, and will withhold the same from disposal by the Government, unless

otherwise specially instructed. * Very respectfully,

Douglas, Wyoming. SIRS:
I am in receipt of a letter, dated October 27, 1900, from P. M. Shannon, enclosing a petition for the suspension from disposal under the agricultural laws, of lands in Ts. 38 to 43 N., Rs. 77 to 80 W., Wyoming.
The petitioners allege a personal knowledge of the lands and believe them to be more valuable for their oil deposits than for any other purpose.
The suspension of the lands from entry is desired that their character may be investigated and the mineral lands preserved to the miner and prospector.
Sufficient reasons therefor being shown, all the public lands in the above townships are hereby temporarily suspended from disposal under the agricultural laws. A special agent will be detailed, by this office, to make an examination of said lands.
Make the proper notations on your records. This suspension will not interfere with any entries allowed for said lands or with contests involving the same, but you will issue no final certificates upon entries allowed until further instructions.

SIRS:

Los Angeles, California.

January 24, 1901, Messrs. Hendrick and Wright, San Diego, California, petitioned

this office for the suspension from entry of certain described lands because

a large number of individuals, residents of the State of California have discovered xxx superficial mineral deposits not in place consisting of large quantities of gypsum, which lands also contain strong surface indications of petroleum xxx and in pursuance of the custom of miners in the mining districts of the State of California posted notices, of their several mining locations upon said0lands at point of discovery.

Redding, California.

SIRS:

By my letter of December 26, 1900, to Hon. George C. Perkins, U. S. Senate, of

which you were advised January 28, 1901, the petition of James P. Eaton for the

suspension from agricultural entry of certain described lands in your district alleged

to contain valuable deposits of oil, was denied.

I am now in receipt of a letter from D. G. Reid, Redding, California, dated March

26, 1901, enclosing the petition of Mr. Eaton for the reconsideration of my said letter

of December 26,1900, and as reasons therefor it is alleged by affidavit that on January 1, 1901, the Shasta Consolidated Oil Company, of which Mr. Eaton is president, began active operations upon said lands, and that since said time it has sunk a well upon section 2, township 32 N., R. 3 W., M. D. M., to a depth of 665 feet, and in sinking said well it has struck crude petroleum oil seepages, and that further sinking of said well will develop oil in paying quantities. It is also alleged that if opportunity is offered an investigation will be duly made of all the lands sought to be suspended from entry. The petitioner states that although said lands were returned as non mineral, they have not been sought as agricultural lands and are not in fact agricultural lands but are in reality nearly valueless unless oil should be discovered in paying quantities upon them. The suspension is especially sought because the company has gone to great expense in procuring the best machinery and the best workmen for the sinking of said well, as shown by the rapid progress made therein and only requests a limited time within which to test the territory covered by its claims, which are indicated in red on a map accompanying the petition. This is all the evidence shown as a basis for the desired action. It is not shown how the company acquired control of the tracts which it claims is part of its territory, nor

whether any mineral locations for the land had been made, although reference is made in the original petition to mineral locations upon the land. It would appear, however, that the petitioner may, without injury to the rights of other persons, be .permitted a reasonable time within which to determine, by investigation, the actual

character of the lands which it claims.

SEPTEMBER 27, 1901.

Douglas, Wyoming. SIRS:

By office letter of November 10,1900, l all the public lands in townships 38 to 43 N.,

ranges 77 to 80 W., Wyoming, were temporarily suspended from disposal under the

agricultural laws until a special agent of this office could make an examination of

said lands and report relative thereto. A similar letter relative to those townships

in the Buffalo land district was addressed to the local land officers at Buffalo, Wyoming..

By office letter P of January 21, 1901, special agents John B. Brockenbrough and

Thomas J. Jenkins were directed to make a thorough examination of the townships

described as to their character as oil lands and to submit a separate report on each

township and on each section therein, submitting therewith corroborated affidavits

of reliable persons having personal knowledge of the mineral character of any par-

ticular subdivision of these lands as to the facts and conditions on which their opinions

as to the proper classification are based.

There was also transmitted to sajid agents a copy of the petition filed in this office

January 10, 1901, by Senator C. D. Clark, and signed by E. H. French and thirteen

other citizens of Natrona and Johnson counties, State of Wyoming, asking a suspension

from agricultural entry of the following described lands situate within the State of

Wyoming:

Commencing at the N. E. corner of township forty-twov range seventy-seven, thence west on same township line to the east line of range eighty-six, thence south on same range line to the north line of township forty-one, thence west two miles to the northeast corner of section 3, township forty-one, range eighty-six, thence south on section line to the Ninth Standard Parallel, thence west on same Standard Parallel to the east line of range ninety-six, thence south on same range line to the south line of township thirty-one, thence east on same line to the west line of range eightyseven, thence north on same range line to township thirty-two, thence east on same township line to range eighty-three, thence south on same range line to south line of township thirty-one, thence east on same township line to west line of range seventynine, thence north on same range line to the north line of township thirty-two, thence west on same township line to the west line of range eighty, thence north on same range line to the Eighth Standard Parallel, thence east on same standard line to the east line of range seventy-seven, thence north on same range line to place of beginning.

It was stated that no action had been taken on said petition nor would be taken until after the investigation ordered as to townships 38 to 43 N., Ranges 77 to 80 West, inclusive, was made, on account of the great labor which an investigation, in detail, of such an immense area would involve. The agents were, however, to consider the same generally and to submit one general report thereon corroborated by affidavits designating any particular sections which are supposed to contain oil. -

1 See p. 63.

ORDERS AND CORRESPONDENCE.

67

By office letter P of May 1, 1901, these instructions were modified to the extent of directing the special agents not to make a detailed examination and report on each township but to make a general cursory examination except as to the townships which they were informed contained valuable oil deposits. These latter they were to examine carefully and make a report in detail.
I am now in receipt of the report of special agent Thos. J. Jenkins, dated August 14, 1901, and that of special agent John B. Brockenbrough, dated August 20, 1901. These reports are accompanied by numerous affidavits for and against the suspension of the lands hereinbefore described from agricultural entry; also by maps illustrative of the matters stated in the reports and by exhibits showing the mineral locations and agricultural entries and filings within the territory made the subject of investigation.
The reports of the agents and the evidence accompanying the same have been carefully examined, and without going into the matter in detail it would appear sufficient to say that the following townships appear to contain oil in paying quantities, or such evidences of the existence of oil as would justify the suspension of the same from present disposition under the agricultural land laws that opportunity may be given to develop the same aa mineral, viz:

Township.
31 N., 32 N., 33 N., 34 N., 38 N., 39 N., 40 N., 41 N., 42 N.,

Range.
81W. 81, 82, 83, 86 W. 81, 82, 83, 85, 87, 88, 89, 90 W. 87, 88, 89, 90 W. 77, 78, 79 and 80 W. 77, 78, 79 and 80 W. 77, 78, 79, 80 and 81 W. 77, 78, 79, 80, 81 and 82 W., and 77, 78, 79, 80, 81 and 82 W.

The townships above described are accordingly hereby suspended from agricultural

entry. The suspension of township No. 43 N., ranges 77 to 80, W., is revoked.

Claimants who made entry prior to suspension of November 10, 1900, as to the

lands covered thereby, and prior to the date of this letter as to the additional lands

suspended, may, however, proceed in compliance with the laws under which they

claim to make final proof, at such times as may be required. If such proof is satis-

factory and there is no protest or other objection thereto, you will accept the same,

issue final certificate thereon as in other cases and duly forward the record to this

office, when, if all be found regular patent may issue thereon.

A copy of this letter has been sent to the local land officers at Buffalo, Wyoming,

for their information as to the lands herein described within their district.

You will so note your records.

68 PETROLEUM WITHDRAWALS AND RESTORATIONS.
agricultural entry on the ground that they are mineral (oil bearing) in character. The lands desired withdrawn, are described as follows:
All of Sections 1, 2, 11, 12, 13, 14, 23, 24, 25, 26 and 35 in Township 15, South, Range 43, East of Willamette Meridian0.
All of Sections 7, 8,17,18,19, 20, 21, 22, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34 and 35 in Township 15, South, Range 44, East of Willamette Meridian.
All of Sections 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 17, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27 and 35, in Township 16, South, Range 44 East of Willamette Meridian.
All the Sections lying in the west half of Township 16, South, Range 45, East of Willamette Meridian, excepting therefrom Section 16.
All the Sections lying in the east half of Township 17, South, Range 44 East of Willamette Meridian, excepting therefrom Section 36.
All the Sections lying in the west half of Township 17, South, Range 45, East of Willamette Meridian, excepting therefrom Section 16.
It is stated that petitioners are unable to determine whether or not the lands above described include any lands granted in aid of the construction of the Dalles Military Wagon Road, and patented by the United States under that grant, or lands which have been entered by any other persons, and that if it should be found on an examination of the records of this office that any of the lands described have been so disposed of, the petition be considered as being withdrawn as to all lands found to have been patented, or which have been entered by any other person.
The petition is supported by the report of M. M. Ogden, said to be an expert regarding lands chiefly valuable for petroleum or other mineral oils, the affidavits of I. W. Hope, Walter Moore, W. P. Keady and W. C. Elliott, a civil engineer and surveyor, and a blue print map showing the lands that are sought to be withdrawn, and the mineral locations made by thirty five mining associations represented by the petitioners herein.
While petitioners speak of only one seepage of oil in one of the small pools formed by several springs impregnated with gypsum and sulphur, and solidified bitumen in the sand-stone and conglomerate outcroppings at several places, the showing made indicates the existence of oil on the lands described, the geological formation being very similar to that of localities where oil has been produced in large quantities, particular reference being made in this respect to the Kern river basin in California. The purpose of the petitioners is to take steps to determine the existence of oil by actual operations, and to that end the withdrawal is asked.
All of the lands described in the petition are within the granted or indemnity limits of the Dalles Military Wagon Road Company, and various tracts have been selected by said company or entered by private parties under the agricultural laws.
There appears to be no good reason why the lands described by petitioners not entered or patented should not be withdrawn, as requested, with such restrictions as seem just to both the agricultural and mineral claimants.
Accordingly, the lands described in the petition are, with the exception of those tracts entered or patented, hereby withdrawn from agricultual entry for a period of one year from date hereof, provided, that failure to prosecute work with reasonable diligence shall be considered an abandonment and consequently good cause for revoking the withdrawal.
You will so advise petitioners, through Mr. Hirsch, at Portland, Oregon, making the proper notations on the records of your office.

SIRS:

Under date of October 15, 1901, there was received in this office a letter dated October 7, 1901, from Mr. J. N. Teal, Portland, Oregon, enclosing a petition in behalf

of himself and others praying that certain lands in your district be withdrawn from agricultural entry on the ground that they are mineral (oil bearing) in character. The

lands desired withdrawn are described as follows:

All of sections 30, 31, 32, 33, T. 17 S., R. 43 E., W. M.;

All of sections 3, 4, 5, N. $ of Sec. 6 and S. } of Sec. 8, T. 18 S., R. 43 E., W. M.

It is stated that petitioners are unable to determine whether or not the lands above

described are included in lands granted in aid of the construction of the Willamette

Valley and Cascade wagon road and patented by the United States under that grant

or lands which have been entered by any other persons and that if it should be found

on examination of the records of this office that any of the lands described have been

so disposed of the petition be considered as being withdrawn as to all lands found

to have been patented or which have been entered by any other person.

The petition is supported by the affidavit of I. W. Hope, setting forth the facts

regarding the mineral character of the lands described therein and having attached a map showing sixteen placer mineral claims located on a portion of the lands in question and also a list of members of the various associations on whose behalf the

petition is presented, and by the affidavit of F. O'Neil and W. E. Harris corroborating

the affidavit of Mr. Hope. The affidavit of Mr. Hope sets out that he personally visited and examined every
legal subdivision of said lands, that they consist of rolling hills which, wherever the formation is'exposed, are shown by the outcroppings to consist of shales, both silicified

and clay, and of sandstone and conglomerates with deposits of diatomaceous earth in close proximity; that said lands are impregnated with gypsum, apparently deposited

from solution; that on said lands there are also evidence of gas escapes which are indicated by finely divided red and yellow ochres which appear on the surface of

the ground; that the sandstone strata on said lands are stained with violet stains; that a seepage of mineral oil appears at certain places on said lands and that said

lands and all of them are mineral in character and are chiefly valuable as mineral lands.

This report of an examination made by Mr. Hope would indicate that the geological formation of the lands it is desired to have withdrawn is very similar to that of localities where oil has been produced in large quantities and the purpose of the petitioners seem to be to take steps to determine the existence of oil by actual operations.
Portions of sections 3, 4, 5, 6 and 8, T. 18 S., R. 43 E., are covered by selections

of the Willamette Valley and Cascade Wagon Road Company and by entries made by

private parties under the agricultural laws. There appears, however, to be no good reason why the lands described by petitioners not entered or patented should not be withdrawn as requested with such restrictions as seem just to both the agricultural and mineral claimants.
Accordingly the lands described in the petition are, with the exception of those tracts entered or patented, hereby withdrawn from agricultural entry for the period of one year from the date hereof, provided that failure to prosecute mineral development work with reasonable diligence shall be considered an abandonment and consequently good cause for revoking the withdrawal.
You will so advise petitioners through Mr. Teal, at Portland, Oregon, making the proper notations on the records of your office.

Cowgill, Baker City, Oregon,, in behalf of himself and others, praying that certain lands in your district be withdrawn from agricultural entry on the ground that they are mineral (oil bearing) in character. The lands desired withdrawn are described as follows:
The NW. i of the NW. i, the S. * of the NW. -J-, the SW, i of the NE. }, the S. J, of Sec. 10, and all of section 25, T. 19 S., R. 43 E., W. M.

The petition is supported by the report of Mr. J. D. Miles, said to be an expert regarding lands chiefly valuable for petroleum and other mineral oils and the affidavits of W. C. Cowgill, L. W. Burtch and J. D. Miles, setting forth the facts relating to the mineral character of the lands in question and the location of certain placer mining claims, forty-three in number, thereon. The petition is also accompanied by diagrams of said townships showing said mineral locations and the names of the associations claiming the same.
It is stated in the report of Mr. Miles that:
The subdivisions referred to consist of silicified and clay shales, sandstones, coarse and close grained, and what may be styled a sub-strata of pebbly conglomerates. There are deposits of infusorial earth largely dispersed over the lands in question with a considerable portion of gypsious clays. The underlying formation is clay, sandstone and calcareous concretions, white calcareous shales, fossiliferous concretions, carboniferous lime and lime shale. The formation generally is such as to give the lands in question a high character as lands peculiar to oil formations on the Pacific Coast. There are indications on the surface of finely disintegrated red and yellow ochres which have suffered dessecation from ferruginious deposits which apparently were carried to the surface by the action, as indications seem to show, of volatile hydrocarbons. The sandstone strata is impregnated and stained with deposits which would result from such source as soon as the sandstone is exposed to the air. There are in places deposits of lignite of a low carboniferous form and in some place along the dry bed of creek running into the Malheur River may be found within the escarpments of the foothills down to the outcropping rim-rocks of sandstone indications of solidified bitumen which in my opinion are the deposits in residuous form of liquid hydrocarbons.
The land in question is unfit for agricultural or pasturage purposes. At several points along the dry bed of the creek shown on the township plat of township 19 S.,

R. 44 E., prepared by L. W. Burtch, U. S. deputy mineral surveyor, there is to be found dark carbonaceous shales which prove the existence of liquid hydrocarbons which leads me to the conclusion that this section of country will on development produce petroleum with a paraffine base.
This showing indicates that there is a possibility that the lands described, on development, will be found to be oil lands and as none of the tracts have been entered or otherwise disposed of I see no objection to the withdrawal thereof as requested, with such restrictions as seem just to both agricultural and mineral claimants.
Accordingly the lands described in the petition are hereby withdrawn from agricultural entry for a period of one year from date hereof, provided that failure to prosecute mineral development work with reasonable diligence shall be considered an abandonment and consequently good cause for revoking the withdrawal.
You will so advise petitioners, through Mr. Cowgill at Baker City, Oregon, making the proper notations on the records of your office.

The COMMISSIONER OF THE

GENERAL LAND OFFICE.

SIR:

Herewith is a petition from the Union Pacific Kailroad Company, wherein that

company sets forth that Sec. 27, T. 15 N., R. 118 W., Evanston, Wyoming, land

district, is one of the alternate odd-numbered sections within the limits of the grant

made to aid in the construction of the Union Pacific railroad; that the company's

main line of road has been changed so as to extend across this section; that the company

has had a coal mine thereon since 1899, from which coal has been and is being taken

in large quantities, and that the opening and development of this mine was at an

expenditure to the company of over $175,000. It also appears from this petition and

the files of your office, that the company, in the course of an endeavor to procure a

supply of water for its said mining operations and the use of its employes engaged

therein, sunk a well upon said section in 1900, in which some evidences of oil were

found, but which did not result in the production of a supply of good water. Said

petition states, in substance, that there has been no discovery of valuable deposits

of oil in said section; that it is not valuable for other minerals than coal; and that

it is of very great value for its coal deposits.

The Department will, at the earliest moment, send a special inspector to make a

thorough and impartial investigation of the situation respecting the known character

of this section, that is, as to whether, under the development then existing, it is more

valuable for oil than for coal. The railroad company and the oil prospectors and pro-

testants will be accorded a full opportunity to -be heard before the inspector and to

present all existing proofs to him, and the extent and character of the oil discovery

in the well sunk by the railroad company will be carefully investigated by him.

The Department will then, upon full consideration of the matter, promptly deter-

mine Jwhether said section passed to the railroad company under its grant or is

excepted therefrom.

As to other unpatented alternate odd-numbered sections within the limits of the

grant 1 which are not occupied or used for any important purpose, but which are

supposed (as contradistinguished from known) to contain oil deposits, and which are

attempted to'be prospected and explored for that reason, the consideration of the re-

quested issuance of patents will be deferred a reasonable time to permit such pros-

pecting and exploration to be thoroughly done wherever it is attempted in good faith.

If the work of prospecting or exploration is retarded or interfered with by the railroad

company, consideration of the requested issuance of patents will be further deferred

accordingly.

Burns, Oregon. SIRS:

By office letter "N " of October 7, 1901, 1 upon petition of Solomon Hirsch, of Port-

land, Oregon, and others, certain lands in your district alleged to be oil bearing in

character were withdrawn horn agricultural entry for a period of one year from date

hereof, provided that failure to prosecute work with reasonable diligence shall be con-

sidered an abandonment and consequently good cause for revoking the withdrawal.

The lands so withdrawn are described as follows:

All of sections 1, 2, 11,12,13,14, 23, 24, 25, 26 and 35 in Township 15, South, Range 43, East of Willamette Meridian.
All of sections 7, 8,17,18,19, 20, 21, 22, 27: 23, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34 and 35 in Township 15, South, Range 44, East of Willamette Meridian.
All of sections 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10; 11, 12, 13,14, 15, 17, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27 and 35, in Township 16, South, Range 44 East of Willamette Meridian.

All the sections lying in the west half of Township 16, South, Range 45, East of Willamette Meridian, excepting therefrom section 16.
All the sections lying in the east half of Township 17, South, Range 44 East of Willamette Meridian, excepting therefrom section 36.
All the sections lying in the west half of Township 17, South, Range 45, East of Willamette Meridian, excepting therefroirf section 16.
I am now in receipt of application of the Malheur Oil Compa,ny by its president, Solomon Hirsch, and secretary Isaac N. Fleischner, to extend the withdrawal for an additional period of not less than one year. The application is supported by the affidavits of I. W. Hope, W. G. Hope and W. P. Keady and is based upon the following state of facts:
The Malheur Oil Company is the owner of 64 oil locations of 160 acres each of these lands, the locations having been made by 64 associations of individuals and by them sold to the Malheur Oil Company. The company began the work of developing these alleged oil fields late in 1901 and has since expended a sum in excess of $12,600 in the construction of buildings, the purchase and installation of machinery on the ground, payment for labor and for supplies, fuel and other incidental expenses. A sufficient plant has been installed to sink a well 3,000 feet and a well has been sunk to a depth of over 800 feet. All this development work is on the N. £ of Sec. 29, T. 15 N., R. 44 W.2
It is further set forth in the application that it is the intention of the company to carry on the work with all diligence and should the well at present being sunk fail to disclose the presence of oil in commercial quantities to sink another well or wells with a view to giving the lands a thorough test, but that in view of the uncertainty of work of this character the company can not safely engage in the development of these lands in the manner desired without further assurance that its title to these claims will be protected from agricultural entry.
These lands comprise 103 sections in six contiguous townships and up to date, though nine months have elapsed since the withdrawal, no development work has been done or even commenced at but the one point on section 29. The suspension under the withdrawal made October 7, 1901, provided that "failure to prosecute work with reasonable diligence shall be considered an abandonment and consequently good cause for revoking the order." It is possible that this proviso was not fully understood and that the position of this office may be more clearly denned it will be required of persons and corporations working under the privilege granted by the extension of the period of withdrawal for one year, to October 7,1903, which is hereby

ordered, that they make earnest and diligent efforts to exploit these land? for oil and that the land shall be prospected and exploited in various and other places than is shown to have been done during the past year and that operations at different points must be entered upon and continued with reasonable diligence po that at the end of this extended period it will have been satisfactorily demonstrated whether or not the lands or any portion thereof are in fact oil lands. It is believed that if the parties interested in prospecting these lands will enter upon their work in good faith and make earnest and diligent efforts to ascertain the true characterof these lands that the extension herein allowed will be ample for such purpose.
Make proper note hereof upon your records and'duly advise the applicants. . . Very respectfully,

EESTOEATION OF OCTOBER 6, 1902.

OCT. 6, 1902.

SIRS:

Los Angeles, California.

By office letter "N " of August 11,1900, 1 townships 2 and 3 S., ranges 1, 2 and 3 W.,

S. B. M., were suspended from disposition under the agricultural land laws upon alle-

gations that same contained deposits of mineral (oil). During the latter part of March

and the early part of April, 1902", a special agent of this Department visited said town-

ships, examined the same and interviewed parties living therein, among others Mr.

Arthur G. Munn et al., who filed the allegation that said townships contain mineral.

The special agent reports that he finds no evidences of mineral upon any of said lands

and no attempt at development work except on the north half of section 4, T. 3 S.,

R. 2 W.. where three wells have been sunk. The first of these wells was sunk in an

attempt to discover oil but at the depth of 750 feet a 9-inch flow of water was struck

whereupon the parties who were boring same abandoned their intention of exploring

for oil and are using said water for irrigation purposes, and that the two other wells

sunk upon said section were sunk for the purpose of obtaining water for irrigating.

The special agent states that the parties who filed the mineral allegations now state that

after prospecting over the lands they are satisfied that none of said lands contain oil

except the north half of section 4, T. 3 S., R. 2 W., upon which tract they decline to

express an opinion. Numerous other parties were interviewed by the agent and all

state that no oil has ever been discovered upon the lands in question or adjacent

thereto. The special agent therefore concludes that the lands have no value whatever

for mineral but do possess some value for grazing and agricultural purposes and recom-

mends that the suspension be revoked.

The said townships were returned as agricultural by the survey thereof and since

the suspension no allegations have been made as to the mineral character of said lands

which would justify any further investigation by this office or the further suspension

of the tracts mentioned. In view of these facts, and of the report submitted by the

special agent, the lands in townships 2 and 3 S., ranges 1, 2 and 3 W., S. B. M., are

hereby relieved from the suspension imposed thereupon by office letter "N" of

August 11, 1900.

Make the proper notations upon your records.

I am now in receipt of a petition from W. C. Cowgill, Baker City, Oregon, and also

a letter from Hon. John H. Mitchell, U. S. Senate, requesting, for reasons stated, that

the period during which said lands shall remain so withdrawn be extended for a further

period of one year.

The reasons presented, which are in substance that the petitioners have been unable

as yet to determine with certainty whether said lands are valuable for oil, appear to

me to be sufficient on which to base favorable action. Accordingly the suspension

of the lands described from agricultural entry is hereby extended for a period of one

year from date hereof with the same proviso made a part of the former withdrawal,

viz: That failure to prosecute mineral development work with reasonable diligence

shall be considered an abandonment and consequently good cause for revoking the

withdrawal.

. This withdrawal will expire .by limitation in time without furth'er action by this

office, unless the same is officially extended.

You will advise petitioners, through Mr. Cowgill, at Baker City, Oregon, of this

action, making the proper notations on the records of your office.

Township 23 S., R. 18 E., and townships 24 S., Ranges 17, 18 and 19 E., M. D. M.,

were alleged to contain mineral (oil) in a general protest filed in this office January 29,

1900, and the lands therein were suspended from disposition under the agricultural

land laws by telegram "P"'of February 28, 1900. 2

Acting under general instructions from this office, a special agent visited and

examined said townships in September 1902 and reports that so far as he has been

able to ascertain no oil or other mineral has been discovered upon any of said lands

and that no attempt at mineral development is now being made; that the lands are

apparently valueless except for agricultural and grazing purposes. He interviewed

and obtained the affidavits of three residents of Tp. 24 S., R. 19 E., and all agree that

the townships mentioned are chiefly valuable for grazing and that to their knowledge

no minerals have been discovered thereon and further that no development work is

being prosecuted on any of the said lands.

Upon the information obtained from such examination and interviews, the special

agent recommends that the lands be relieved from suspension.

The townships in question were returned as agricultural by the official surveyors and

I fail to find any specific protest against any tracts therein. On a blue print accom-

panying the general protest hereinbefore mentioned, the Eureka Consolidated Fuel

and Oil Co. is shown to claim portions of Sees. 12 and 14, Tp. 23 S., R. 18 E., but the

address of said company is unknown to me. However, the removal of the order of

suspension will not affect the rights of said company or of others, if there be any

claiming any portion of said lands under the mining laws and in view of the report

and recommendation of the special agent and of the fact that no one is now before

the office with any specific claim or protest adverse thereto, said Townships 23 S.,

R. 18 E. and 24 S., Ranges 17, 18 and 19 E., M. D. M., are hereby relieved from the

suspension placed thereon by telegram "P" of February 28, 1900.

DECEMBER 30,1902. The COMMISSIONER OF THE
GENERAL LAND OFFICE. SIR:
In a communication addressed to your office by this Department, June 3,1902, 1 relating to the unpatented alternate odd-numbered sections of land within the limits of the grant to the Union Pacific Railroad company, in the Evanston land district, Wyoming, it was ordered that action upon requests by the said company for the issuance of patents to embrace said lands be deferred for the time being to permit euch investigation and consideration as would enable the Department to determine whether, to what extent, and for what time, the further issuance of patents to said company for lands in said district shall be withheld, in order that such lands may be prospected and explored for oil deposits, supposed (as contradistinguished to known) to be contained therein, by persons who may, in good faith, wish to undertake such prospecting and exploration.
Since the date of said communication an investigation has been made of said alternate odd-numbered sections, under the supervision of this Department. As a partial result of that investigation, you are directed that the consideration of requests for patent by the railroad company need be no longer deferred as to any odd-numbered sections of land within its grant which lie east of range 112 in said land district. As to all euch lands you will proceed with the administration of the company's grant, the same as though the order of June 3,1902, had not been made. Requests for patents for alternate odd-numbered sections within the company's grant, which lie west of range 112 in said land district, will remain suspended until more definite direction is given with respect thereto, which will be done as soon as the evidence relating to such lands and taken at said investigation can be carefully considered.

there have been no attempts, so far as he is able to discover, to produce oil and that the surface indications do not warrant the further suspension of the lands on account

He states further that all of the lands hereinbefore mentioned are susceptible of fairly good grazing for from three to four months in the year and that none of them are strictly agricultural.
I have carefully examined the records of this office and find that most of the lands hereinbefore described were returned as agricultural by the survey thereof. No mineral entries appear to have been made in any of said townships during recent years and there is nothing upon the records to indicate that attempts are being made to enter same as mineral. In view of the report of the special agent, who it appears has made a thorough examination of the lands and failed to discover any evidences of mineral thereupon', and of the fact that applications have been made to this office to enter same under the agricultural land laws, it is stated for grazing purposes, it is believed that ample opportunity has been given for the exploration which protestants stated they were about to make, and that conditions do not warrant the maintenance of the order of suspension for a longer period.

WITHDRAWAL AND RESTORATION OF MARCH 16, 1903.

SECRETARY HITCHCOCK TO THE COMMISSIONER OP THE GENERAL LAND OFFICE, MARCH 16, 1903.

(32 L. D., 48.)
In a communication addressed to your office by this Department June 3, 1902,* it was ordered that action upon requests by the Union Pacific Railroad Company for the issuance of patents to the unpatented alternate odd numbered sections of land within the limits of said company's grant in the Evanston land district, Wyoming, be deferred for the time being, to permit such investigation and consideration as would enable the Department to determine whether, to what extent, and for what time, the further issuance of patents to said company for lands in said district shall be withheld in order that such lands may be prospected and explored for oil deposits supposed (as contradistinguished from known) to be contained therein, by persons who may, in good faith, wish to undertake such prospecting and exploration.
Subsequently to the date of said communication, an investigation of said alternate odd numbered sections was made, under the direction of this Department. As a partial result of that investigation, your office was instructed, by departmental communication of December 30, 1902, 2 that the consideration of requests for patent by said company need no longer be deferred as to any odd numbered sections of land within its grant lying east of range 112 in said land district; that as to all such lands the administration of the company's grant should be proceeded with the same as though the order of June 3, 1902, had not been made; and that requests for patent to alternate odd numbered sections within the company's grant lying west of range 112 in said land district should remain suspended until more definite direction could be given with respect thereto. More definite direction will now be given.
As the result of a full and careful examination and consideration of the evidence taken in the investigation before named, your office is directed as follows:
(1) To suspend until December 1, 1903, all proceedings looking to the patenting, under the Union Pacific railroad land grant, of any lands within the following limits in said Evanston land district, to-wit: Beginning on the western boundary of the State of Wyoming at the point where the same intersects the south line of township 13 north, and running thence east along said township line to its intersection with the eastern line of range 117 west, and running thence north along said range line to its intersection with the southern line of township 15 north, and running thence east along said township line to its intersection with the eastern line of range 115 west, and running thence north along said range line, with its off-sets, to its intersection with the north line of township 21 north, and running thence along said township

line to its intersection with the said western boundary of the State of Wyoming, and

running thence south along said State boundary to the place of beginning.

(2) To withhold and suspend, until December 1, 1903, from entry, location and

disposition of every character, .under any of the public land laws other than the mining

laws, all public lands within the limits hereinbefore specifically described; but this

shall not, of itself, delay or prevent the recognition or perfection of any bonafide

claim heretofore initiated under any of the public land laws to any public lands within

said limits.

(3) To relieve from the orders of June 3,1902, and December 30,1902, before named,

all the odd numbered sections within said railroad land grant which are not embraced

within the limits hereinbefore specifically described, and as to the lands so relieved,

to proceed with the administration and adjustment of said land grant as if'the re-

strictive orders of June 3, 1902, and December 30, 1902, had not been issued.

(4) Upon and after December 1, 1903, and without awaiting further direction, to

proceed with the administration and adjustment of said railroad land grant as to the

alternate odd numbered sections within said land grant which are also within the lim-

its hereinbefore specifically described, and in so doing to consider and determine, in

due course and according to the usual rules, the then known character of the lands

within said limits sought to be patented under said railroad land grant, and to con-

sider and determine, in due course and according to the usual rules, all claims asserted

under the mining laws to any of said lands.

(5) Upon and after December 1, 1903, and without awaiting further direction, to

treat the public lands within the limits hereinbefore specifically described as relieved from this order of suspension, and to permit entry, location and disposition thereof

according to their nature and in conformity with law.

The purpose of this order is to permit, encourage and protect, so far as the Depart-

ment can do so, but within the time herein named, the exploration and exploitation

of the unpatented alternate odd numbered sections within said railroad land grant

which are within the limits hereinbefore specifically described, and of the public

lands within said limits, for the purpose of ascertaining and demonstrating whether,

as claimed, such lands or any of them are mineral in character, in that they are chiefly

valuable for their oil or other mineral deposits; but in justice to the railroad company,

whose line of railroad has long since been completed in conformity with the land grant

act, and in justice to others who may desire to take any of the public lands within

said limits under any of the public land laws other than the mining laws, it is neces-

sary that this order of suspension shall not be operative longer than until December 1,

1903, that being deemed ample time within which, in addition to the exploration

and exploitation heretofore had, to fairly develop the character of these lands.

The direction herein given should be promptly communicated to the local land

officers by telegraph, as well as by letter, but such direction will not in any manner

apply to any lands heretofore patented to the railroad company or to others.

The papers relating to the investigation herein referred to are herewith transmitted

for the files of your office.

Douglas, Wyoming. SIRS:

By office letter of September 27, 1901, l addressed to you, certain lands in your

district and in the Buffalo, Wyoming, land district, were suspended from present

disposition under the agricultural land laws that opportunity might be given to de-

velop the same as mineral it appearing that said lands contain oil in paying quantities

or such evidences of the existence of oil as would justify the action taken.

The lands so suspended are described as follows:

It would appear that ample opportunity has been afforded mineral claimants to

explore and develop the land in question and that the public interests would be pro-

moted by the removal of the order of suspension from such lands as now appear to be

non-mineral in character. Accordingly the suspension of September 27, 1901, is

revoked except as to the following described lands:

Sections 25 to 36 inclusive, of T. 42 N., R. 78 W.

Sections 25 to 36 inclusive of T. 42 N., R. 79 W.

By'telegram "P" of February 26, 1900, 1 lands in T. 27 S., R. 18 E. M. D. M., were

withdrawn from disposition under the agricultural land laws upon the allegation that

same contain deposits of mineral (oil). The lands in said township were examined

by a special agent of this office in the month of February 1903, and I am now in receipt

of his report to the effect that same are apparently valueless except for agricultural

and grazing purposes; that so far as he has been able to ascertain no oil or other mineral

has been discovered in said township, and that no attempt at mineral development is

now being made. He interviewed a number of residents in the vicinity and appends

their statements to the effect that to their knowledge there is no indication of oil or

other mineral upon said lands and that no development work for the production of

minerals is being prosecuted in any portion thereof and that in their opinion same is

chiefly valuable for agricultural purposes. The agent therefore has. reached the

conclusion that the lands in T. 27 S., R. 18 E., have no value for mineral but do pos-

sess some value for agricultural and grazing purposes and he accordingly recommends

that the order of suspension be removed therefrom.

It appears from an examination of the records of this office that said township was

returned as agricultural by the survey thereof and that no mineral applications or

entries have been presented for lands therein. Applications have, however, been

received at this office for entry of a portion of said lands under the agricultural land

laws. In view of the finding made by the special agent and of the other facts men-

tioned herein it would appear that no reason for the further suspension of said lands

exists and said Township 27 South, Range 18 East, M. D. M., is hereby relieved from

the suspension placed thereon by telegram "P" of February 26, 1900.

RESTORATION OF AUGUST 18, 1903.
AUGUST 18, 1903. REGISTER AND RECEIVER,
Los Angeles, California. SIRS:
By office letter of August 11, 1900,* the land in townships 1 S. of ranges 16, 17, 18, 19 and 20 W., S. B. M., were suspended from disposition under the agricultural land laws upon allegation that same was valuable for its deposits of mineral (oil). February 13, 1902, you transmitted to this office, in connection with the record in case of the application of Jose Serrano to enter under the homestead laws a portion of section 9, T. IS., R. 20 W., a statement by Mr. H. W. Duncan to the effect that the suspension of said lands has resulted in hardship to settlers and to those desiiing to settle upon the public domain and has served no good purposes and that notwithstanding the fact that considerable prospecting has been done no oil whatever has been discovered. Said record is also accompanied by a petition signed by William F. Swinney and four other persons who state that they are settlers in T. IS., R. 20 W., and request that the order of suspension be revoked for the reason that the lands withdrawn are nonmineral in character and have no value except for farming and grazing purposes.
Mr. A. W. Marsh, of Los Angeles, has filed in this office a number of statements to the effect that the lands in question are of no value except for their deposits of mineral and that if the order of suspension is allowed to remain, the mineral prospectors will be enabled to enlist capital to assist in the development of the deposits of mineral therein contained, but if the order of suspension is revoked it will be impossible to obtain money to complete the work. The statement is accompanied by several affidavits from persons who state that they are familiar with the lands in question and that in their opinion the whole district is essentially mineral except a few tillable spots now occupied by homesteaders.
Acting under instructions received from this office, a special agent visited the land in question during the month of July, examined same and interrogated a number of persons resident in the vicinity, obtaining their affidavits as to the character of the land and other facts pertinent to the investigation. The special agent now reports that careful inquiry of persons resident in the vicinity failed to elicit anything which would show that the lands have any value for oil or minerals of any kind. One well was bored in T. IS., R. 20 W., some time ago but instead of oil, water was found and the well was abandoned. He also found, in Sec. 27, T. IS., R. 17 W., upon the homestead claim of John Henry an incline of about 100 feet and a shaft fifteen feet in depth in none of which was any discovery of oil or mineral made. He further reports that he did not find, in any portion of the townships hereinbefore desciibed, any oil seepages, oil springs, surface or other indications of oil or mineral which would warrant the lands being classed as mineral in character. The only indication of oil he discovered was a slight coating in some small wells or seams of hard rock on the homestead claim of John Henry. But the prospecting in which Mr. Henry is engaged has up to this time failed to result in the discovery or development of oil or mineral of any kind. The said report is accompanied by the affidavits of a number of persons resident near the lands who state that in their opinion no discoveries of mineral sufficient to warrant the continuance of the order of suspension have been made upon the lands in question; that while the land is rough and broken there are numerous fertile and tillable valleys, while the mountain sides will afford grazing for cattle thus making the land more valuable for agricultural and grazing purposes than for mineral.
The special agent also forwards an affidavit made by Mr. A. W. Marsh which states in a general way that he has examined the lands in question and found oil seepages,
i See p. 62.

88 PETROLEUM WITHDRAWALS Attfc RESTORATIONS.
deposits of shale, etc., which indicate that the township is underbid by deposits of oil.
Upon careful consideration of the whole matter, the conclusion is reached that the public interest will be best subserved by a removal of the order of suspension from said land. The said order of suspension, made August 11, 1900, was intended to be temporary only, giving the prospectors time to explore and develop the district and it would appear that ample time has elapsed within which to have demonstrated the existence of mineral therein, if any does exist. It would appear, however, from the statement of the special agent, that all attempts to bore for oil have resulted in failures and that no indication of the existence of valuable deposits of mineral have been found therein. The said order of suspension of August ] 1,1900, is accordingly hereby revoked. Make the proper notations upon your records.

Oregon, and others, alleging that the lands are mineral (oil bearing) in character:

All of sections 1, 2,11,12,13,14, 23, 24, 25, 26 and 35 in Township 15, South, Range

ship 15, South, Range 44 East, of Willamette meridian.

All of sections 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 17, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26,

27 and 35, in Township 16, South, Range 44 East of Willamette meridian.

Willamette meridian, excepting therefrom section 16.

All the sections lying in the east half of Township 17, South, Range 44, East of

Willamette meridian, excepting therefrom section 36.

July 7, 1902, there was received an application from the Malheur Oil Company,

of Portland, Oregon, asking for an extension of said withdrawal for the reason that

while said company began the work of development of their claims upon said lands

in 1901 and had expended a considerable sum in the construction of buildings, in-

stallation of machinery, and so forth, they had not had sufficient opportunity to give

the lands a thorough test. Accordingly, by office letter of July 21, 1902, the said

suspension of the lands hereinbefore described was extended to October 7, 1903, pro-

vided petitioners "make earnest and diligent efforts" to exploit the lands for oil.

The periods of suspension as fixed by said office letters of October 7, 1901, and July

21, 1902, have expired and it is believed that no good reason exists for the further

suspension of the lands in question. If locations and discoveries of oil have been

made upon any of the lands in question, the locators may protect their interests in

the premises should any of said tracts be entered under the agricultural land laws,

by filing in the proper local land office their duly corroborated protests. You will

accordingly make such notations upon your records as will show that the lands are

suspended from disposition under the agricultural land laws on account of their alleged mineral (oil) character. A special agent of this office has recently examined the lands therein and reports that same are rough and mountainous and have for many years been used principally for the grazing of cattle and sheep; that on Sec. 18, T. 23 S., R. 17 E., he found "an oil or tar spring" and that near this spring two wells have been bored for oil in one of which he was informed that some oil had been found but not in paying quantities. That in T. 23 S., R. 16 E., four wells were bored for oil, about three years ago, which were practically failures and that since that time no attempt has been made to develop oil on any portion of the lands in townships referred to so far as he was able to ascertain. He recommends that the lands be relieved from further suspension. It would not appear from statements contained in said report that sufficient indications of mineral exist in said townships to justify a further suspension thereof and no objection appearing thereto upon the records of this office, T. 23 S., R. 16 and 17 E., M.

By letter "N" of September 5, 1900,2 certain townships in your district, among

them townships 18 N., R. 5 W., and 17 and 21 N., R. 6 W., M. D. M., were suspended

from disposition under the agricultural land laws on account of their alleged mineral

(oil) character. Said action appears to have been based in part upon a petition filed

by Ben F. Geis of Willows, California, and others, through Hon. V. H. Metcalf, House

of Representatives, in which petition it was stated that townships 18 and 19, 20 and

21 N., R. 6 W., M. D. M., are in a locality where a number of oil locations had been

made and petroleum discovered. It was stated in the affidavit accompanying said

petition that a corporation had been formed for the development of the alleged oil

deposits and that it was the intention of persons connected therewith to -proceed as

rapidly as possible to thoroughly investigate and explore the entire tract and it was

asked that the land be withdrawn and suspended from entry until a complete inves-

tigation and thorough development could be had. A special agent of this office has recently made a personal examination of townships 18 N., R. 5 W., and 17 N., R. 6 W., M. D. M., and reports that although many mineral locations were made upon lands in said locality, apparently for speculative purposes there does not appear to have been any attempt to drill for or discover oil either upon the lands in said township or in the immediate vicinity thereof. He states that he has not examined T. 21 N., R. 6 W. recently but has examined the territory upon three different occasions during the past thre.e years, has also made diligent inquiry of every person to whom he was recommended as having knowledge of conditions in the locality and so far as he could learn there has been no mineral discovery in the township. A well has been drilled to the depth of 2500 feet in the township immediately south but no oil in paying quantities has been discovered. He expresses the opinion that in view of the fact that no development work has been done or mineral discovered upon the three townships last described, although same have been suspended for more than three years, that the lands therein should be opened for entry under the agricultural land laws. In letter dated August 26, 1903, you stated that in the territory withdrawn by letter of September 5,1900, there has not been to your knowledge
any discovery of oil in paying quantities and at present no prospecting is being done for the purpose of developing oil therein; that frequently inquiry is made at your office by citizens who desire to make homestead entries on the land but who are prevented from so doing by the suspension, and express the opinion that the lands in question have no mineral value but are valuable only for agricultural and grazing purposes. The statement made in the special agent's report are not controverted by anything of record in this office and it would appear that during the.period which has elapsed since said suspension, as above stated, more than three years, the petitioners hereinbefore named, and any other persons interested in the mineral development of the lands have had ample opportunity to explore and develop same. In view of this fact, and of the fact that it appears from the special agent's report that no oil has been discovered upon any of the lands in question, it is believed that no good reason exists for the further suspension of the lands in question.
If locations and discoveries of mineral have been made upon any of the tracts in question, the locators may protect their interests in the premises, should any of the tracts be entered under the agricultural laws, by filing in the local land office their duly corroborated protests. Accordingly, in view of the foregoing, townships 18 N., R. 5 W., and 17 and 21 N., ranges 6 W., M. D. M., are hereby relieved from suspension. Make the proper notation upon your records.

By letter "N" of this office dated September 5, 1900 J an umber of townships in your district were suspended from disposition under the agricultural land laws upon allegations that they contained deposits of mineral (oil). Said action appears to have been based in part upon a petition filed by Ben. F. Geis of Willows, California, and others through Hon. V. H. Metcalf, House of Representatives, in which petition it was stated that townships 18, 19, 20, and 21, N. R. 6 W. M. D. M. are in a locality where a number of oil locations had been made and petroleum discovered. It was stated in the affidavit accompanying said petition that a corporation had been formed for the development of the alleged oil deposits and that it was the intention of the parties connected therewith to proceed as rapidly as possible to thoroughly investigate and explore the entire tract and it. was requested that the lands be withdrawn and suspended from entry until a complete investigation and thorough development could be had. January 14, 1904, Twps. 18 N. R. 5 W and 17, and 21 N. R 6 W were upon recommendation of a Special Agent of this office relieved from suspension.
I am now in receipt of a further report from the Special Agent to the effect that lie has made three separate trips into the suspended territory and from personal knowledge gained from examinations of the land and from diligent inquiry, states that active development work for oil is being prosecuted in only four places in the vicinity of the suspended territory: viz. 1. By Chehalis Oil and Mg. Co. Sec 13, Twp. 14 N. R., 6 W. (not in suspended territory) where considerable natural gas has been developed and good prospects for oil appear. 2. By Bear Creek Oil Co. on patented land in Sec. 10 Twp. 14 N. R 5 W. 3. By Williams Oil Co. on patented land in Sees 16 and 18, Twp 15, N. R 4 W: claimed to have discovered a good grade of oil. 4. By Washington and California Oil Co. near town of Fruito in Twp. 20 N. R 5 W., well drilled 2500 feet deep without striking oil, but still hopeful and endeavoring to raise funds to continue work.
As a result of his investigation the Agent recommends that the W£ Sec. 6. W£ Sec 7 and NW£ Sec. 19, Twp. 14, N. R 5 W, Sees. 6 and 7 Twp. 15, N. R 4 W and all of Twp. 20 N. R 5 W remain suspended, in order that those who are in good faith

endeavoring to develop oil deposits upon the land and in the immediate vicinity may be encouraged and protected. The remaining land suspended by order of September 51900 should in his opinion be relieved.
In letter dated August 26,1903, you stated that frequently inquiry is made at your office by citizens who desire to make homestead entries upon the lands, but who are prevented from so doing by the suspension, and in your opinion the lands in question have no mineral value but are chiefly valuable for agricultural and grazing purposes. The statements made in the Special Agent's report are not controverted by anything of record in this office and it would appear that during the period which has elapsed since said suspension petitioners herebefore named and any other persons interested in the mineral development of the lands have had ample opportunity to explore and develop same. In view of the foregoing it is believed that the public interest will be best subserved by a removal of the order of suspension from the following lands and said order of Sept. 5, 1900 is hereby revoked to that extent.

By telegram "P" of February 26,JL900, 1 upon the allegation that same contained deposits of mineral (oil) the lands in township 25 S., R. 18 E., M. D. M., were suspended from disposition under the agricultural land laws. The said township has recently been examined by a special agent of this office who reports that on the NW£ of Sec. 22 a well has been bored to the depth of about one thousand feet in which he is informed a trace of oil was found and that another bore will soon be made on the section. On the southwest quarter of said section he found a "gas spring." On section 23 two wells have been bored, in one of which the tools were lost whereupon the well was abandoned; in the second well oil was discovered at a depth of about 680 feet. On the south half of section 24 he found surface indications of oil such as oil springs, asphaltum, etc. He states that the land in the section mentioned is barren and appears to be absolutely worthless for agricultural purposes. As a result of his examination of the land he recommends that all of the township except sections 22, 23 and 24, be relieved from suspension. Upon consideration of the matter it would appear that no further reason exists for the suspension of the lands which the agent recommends should be relieved except unsurveyed section 29 which it is alleged in a protest filed in this office, contained indications of oil and is in possession, under a location made April 22, 1899, of the Western Oil and Refining Company. Accordingly all lands in T. 25 S., ranges 18 E., M.'D. M., except sections 22, 23, 24 and 29, are hereby relieved from suspension.

GENTLEMEN:

In February, 1900,3 this office suspended from disposition under the agricultural

land laws Tps. 25 S., R. 18 E., 20 S., R. 14 and 15 E., Tps. 30 S., R. 25 and 26 E.,

M. D. M., and other lands, upon the allegation that same contained deposits of oil

and that opportunity should be offered for the exploration and development of the

mineral resources therein. The "other lands" mentioned, and sections 22, 23, 24

and 29 of Tp. 25 S., R. 18 E., have been heretofore relieved from suspension and it

would appear that no good reason exists for the further suspension of the Tps. above

enumerated.

Mineral claimants who may be in possession of valid locations therein may protect

their interests should application be filed for any of the lands under the agricultural

laws, by presenting their protests or contests, and if any of the lands are in fact non-

mineral in character, they should be subject to disposition under the appropriate

laws. Said suspension is accordingly hereby revoked. Make the proper notice

upon your records.

Respectfully,

DR. GEO. OTIS SMITH, Director, U. 8. Geological Survey, Washington, D. C.

COALINGA, CAL. June 30,1907.

MY DEAR DR. SMITH: I have just heard indirectly that you and Mr. Garfield and Mr. Pinchot are to be in
this part of the country some time during the summer. While you are on the coast I hope that you may induce Mr. Garfield to come up here and see if something can not be done to settle the land question around here. The area we are mapping this summer, including the Coalinga, McKittrick, Midway and Sunset oil districts contains the only vacant land, giving promise of being oil productive, that I know of in this part of the state. This land which, with few exceptions, is absolutely worthless except for oil land, is being taken up by homesteaders, by scrip and in various other ways. The legitimate oil promoters are anxious that something be done to safeguard the interests of those who are trying to gain title to the land by legitimate development, such as drilling. Will you not take up this matter with Mr. Garfield?
Very truly yours, RALPH ARNOLD

SIR:

I am informed by Mr. Ralph Arnold of the Geological Survey, who is at present

investigating the oil resources and making a geological map of Coalinga and adjacent

fields of California, that certain government lands near Coalinga, presumably oil

bearing, are being entered under the homestead laws. I am further informed that

upon the completion of the geological work in the district, it will be possible to indicate

with considerable accuracy just what lands are mineral bearing.

Until the completion of the detailed map which will be furnished during the coming

winter, Mr. Arnold requests that all government land lying within the territory

enumerated on the accompanying page, be temporarily withdrawn from homestead entry. It is said that nearly, if not quite all of the land mentioned is unfitted for agricultural purposes, and that most of the entries recently made in this region under the homestead and scrip laws are of such a character as to indicate to the most casual observer that the mineral and not the agricultural resources are the ones sought.
In view of the conditions I hereby direct you to temporarily withdraw the lands described in the accompanying list.
Very respectfully, GEORGE W. WOODRUFF
Acting Secretary.

LETTER OF FEBRUARY 24, 1908, FROM DIRECTOR TO SECRETARY.

The Honorable,

FEBRUARY 24, 1908.

The SECRETARY OF THE INTERIOR,

Washington, D. C. SIR:

I have the honor to call your attention to page 15 (inclosed herewith) of the Daily

Consular and Trade Report of the Department of Commerce'and Labor, of Saturday,

February 15, 1908, which directs attention to the superiority of liquid fuels, that

is, petroleum products in one or another form, on steamships, and also to the policy

of the British Government in using such liquid fuels as emergency fuels in battle

ships; also to the editorial on page 3 of The Oil Industry of January 15, 1908.

It will be easy, if desired, to multiply the authoritative statements already in print

concerning the superiority of liquid fuel for trie Navy. For that reason I have to

recommend that the filing of claims to oil lands in the State of California be suspended

in order that the Government may continue ownership of valuable supplies of liquid

fuel in this region where all fuel is expensive.

It is evident from the many reports on the superiority of liquid fuel that the ques-

tion of its adoption is simply a question as to the price at which suitable petroleum

products can be purchased.

The present rate at which the oil lands in California are being patented by private

parties will make it impossible for the people of the United States to continue owner-

ship of oil lands there more than a few months. After that, the Government will

be obliged to repurchase the very oil that it hag practically given away.

The inadequacy of the coal supply on the Pacific Coast is well known to everyone

who has made the subject of fuel a study. The local supply is derived entirely

from a few mines on Puget Sound and one locality in eastern Washington. There

are also some coal developments in Oregon, but no deposits here of a quality much

above a lignite. In California the supply is limited to a small production of poor

coal and coal briquettes about Mount Diablo, near San Francisco; and one mine in

Monterey County, which is producing a small quantity of a fairly good bituminous

which is not being marketed as yet, owing to poor transportation facilities. The

great bulk of the coal used on the Pacific Coast is obtained from our western inland

fields or from Australia.

Regarding the petroleum supply, the production last year did not meet the require-

ments of the trade, and the reserve stock was drawn on to meet the demand. At

present the rate of increase in demand is more rapid than the increase in production,

and this, taken in connection with the great falling off in certain of the older fields,

due to depletion of the sands and to flooding by water of sands which otherwise might

be productive, shows how important is this matter of a conservation of the remaining

supply.

Those areas in which the probabilities are greatest for striking commercial

deposits of oil have nearly all been prospected with a drill and either proven or con-

demned. There are only a few areas of probable oil territory now remaining under

governmental control, and these are rapidly being filed on and patented, either through

legitimate oil development or by subterfuge, over claims for gypsum, etc. If anything

is to be done regarding the matter, there is no question but that it should be done

at once, for prospecting is now going on at an unprecedented rate throughout the

West. All of the larger oil companies realize not only that the supply in the proven

fields is limited, but that the area over which prospecting is liable to result favorably,

is also restricted.

0 Very respectfully,

GEO. OTIS SMITH

Director.

Daily Consular Reports, February 15,1908.

LIQUID FUEL.

Its use favored by the British Admiralty Used in Russian waters.

J. D. Henry, in the London Times, regards the use of liquid fuel on steamships and
for engines generally as settled, which he thinks will be a good thing for the oil fields
in general. He says:
It would not be easy to overestimate the importance of the position secured by liquid fuel in naval engineering science. Practically every problem arising out of its safe storage, complete atomization, and smokeless consumption has been solved, and 1908 finds it permanently established in the British navy as an emergency fuel in battle ships and the steam-raising power which gives the greatest speed in thirty-six of the "coastal" torpedo destroyers and at least five of the "ocean-going" type.
We have this further evidence of the admiralty's confidence in fuel oil that many oil-fired warships are being built; that the fleet auxiliary tank steamer Petroleum is due in this country with a cargo of Texas oil; and that the new tank steamer Oberon is, on Government charter, bound for Rangoon to load the first full cargo of Indian oil for the admiralty.
Used in conjunction with turbines, it has revolutionized the power and speed ideas of those who are responsible for the steam-raising equipment of the mosquito and scout types. The British triumphs of 1907 were secretly secured while foreign naval authorities neglected the subject; in the future, however, as the result of these successes, oil fuel will be an important naval and engineering subject in every country which has a navy.
Liquid fuel is used extensively on vessels running between Baku, Russia, and Petrovsk and Astrakhan, at the mouth of the Volga, and on that river there are large fleets of oil-fired cargo carriers. The Caspian tank steamers (oil-fired) completed the following voyages between Baku and Astrakhan: In 1905, 4,550; in 1906, 3,631, and in 1907, 4,212. During years of large exports the monthly voyages equaled 900, or 7,200 voyages by liquid-fuel-burning carriers .of petroleum and its products for a single navigation.

The Honorable,

CLASSIFICATION OF JUNE 17, 1908. JUNE 17, 1908.

The COMMISSIONER OF THE GENERAL LAND OFFICE-,

Washington, D. C. SIR:

I am enclosing herewith a list of the lands in the Coalinga District, California, which

have been classified as mineral lands by the geologists of this Bureau. The lands

classified as mineral include all those lying between the outcrop of the lowest oil-

bearing formation, the Tejon (Eocene) and a line marking the limits of the area in

which the uppermost oil sand of the District can be reached by a well less than 4500

feet in depth. This basis of classification is believed to give a wide margin to the oil

producers, as, with one or two exceptions, no successful wells over 4400 feet in depth

have been drilled in the California oil fields.

In dealing with oil lands it must be borne in mind, however, that absolute deter-

mination, by work on the surface, of the occurrence or non-occurrence of oil in any

one locality is not possible. The best that can be done is to calculate the degree of

probability on the basis of surface indications and structural conditions. Such calcu-

lations have been made in the Coalinga field and the lands mentioned in the accom-

panying list are believed to be those which future development will prove to be more

or less oil-bearing.

It is therefore requested that the lands mentioned in the accompanying list be

withdrawn from any but mineral land entry. It is believed that all of the other lands

lying between the north line of T. 19 S., and the south line of T. 24 S., M. D. M., and

between the west line of R. 14 E., and the east line of R. 19 E., are non-mineral bearing

in so far as petroleum is concerned.

Very respectfully,

GEO. OTIS SMITH

Director.

DEAR SIR:

I aim in receipt of a letter dated July 8th from Mr. M. R. Campbell, requesting that

certain information concerning public lands south of Goalinga, Cal., be sent to Mr.

Heltman, mineral division, General Land Office. Please inform Mr. Heltman as

follows:

That of the land temporarily withdrawn last summer only that lying in Townships

19 to 24 South and Ranges 14 to 19 East, M. D. M., inclusive, has been passed upon.

All of the rest south of the above is now being examined and will be reported on next

winter; it should therefore not be restored to homestead entry.

I would suggest that you request the Secretary to temporarily withdraw from home-

stead entry all of the land covered by the McKittrick-Sunset special, which was sur-

veyed last winter, and upon which I am now working. The reasons for doing this are

the same as those offered for the withdrawal of the Coalinga lands. Part of the McKit-

trick-Sunset area were withdrawn at the time of withdrawing the Coalinga lands.

Very respectfully,

LETTER OF SEPTEMBER 17, 1908, FROM DIRECTOR TO COMMISSIONER.

SEPT. 17, 1908. To the Honorable,
COMMISSIONER OF THE GENERAL LAND OFFICE, Washington, D. C.
SIR: Under date of August 15,1907, 1 the acting Secretary of the Interior directed you to
temporarily'withdraw certain lands near Coalinga, Cal., pending examination by the Geological Survey. On June 19,2 1908, I sent you a list of lands in the Coalinga District which had been classified as mineral lands by the geologists, and requested that those be withdrawn from any but mineral land entry. The basis for the classification was given, and the belief was expressed that all of the other lands lying between the north line of T. 19 S and the south line of T. 24 S, M. D. M., and between the west line of R. 14 E and the east line of R. 19 E, are non-mineral-bearing, in so far as petroleum is concerned.
I am now informed by Geologist Arnold that among the lands thus restored to agricultural entry there are some tracts which are considered oil land by operators in the

Ill

Coalinga field. Three companies at least have started wells in the territory under question, and two of these three have expended at least $50,000 each in drilling.
As soon as the land in the vicinity of these "wild-cat" wells was thrown open to homestead entry, filings were made on all of the land around these prospect wells, irrespective of whether or not there were mineral filings on the same. In fact, the quarters filed on by the oil men were the ones most eagerly sought by the "scrippers ".
As a matter of opinion, the geologists believe that the classification of last June is correct, but as a matter of policy it seems to them that an effort should be made to protect these operators long enough to allow them to prove or disprove their belief that the land in question is oil bearing.
The land in question lies south of Coalinga, and is pronounced by the geologists as having little or no agricultural value, and in this opinion I concur, from my own observation last year. I recommend that the debatable strip, including the lands described below, be again temporarily withdrawn from agricultural entry, pending the exploration in progress by the oil men. I am confident that the operators are acting in good faith, and deserve protection, inasmuch as they are backing their
judgment by large expenditures in drilling. I have discussed the matter with Secretary Garfield, and he authorizes me to express his approval of this recommendation, provided there are no complications other than those which I have eet forth.
The following are the lands recommended for temporary withdrawal, pending the completion of the drilling tests:

LETTER OF SEPTEMBER 34, 1908, FROM RALPH ARNOLD TO DIRECTOR.
McKiTTiucK, GAL. Sept. 24, 1908. DR. GEO. OTIS SMITH,
Director, U. S. Geological Survey, Washington, D. C.
MY DEAR DOCTOR SMITH: I am enclosing herewith a list of townships along the southwestern side of the San
Joaquin Valley lying between Coalinga, on the south, and Martinez on the north. This land covers the area now being mapped topographically, and which we expect to map geologically next season if plans prepared this year are carried out. There is considerable activity in oil development work thruout portions of this territory, and the same old problems of mineral rights vs. agricultural (mostly fake propositions to get the land for oil) are coming out. The Coalinga proposition worked out so

112

PETROLEUM WITHDRAWALS AND RESTORATIONS.

nicely that I believe an effort should be made to have this land temporarily with-

drawn from agricultural entry pending our classification of it after mapping the geology

of the region.

How about the temporary withdrawal of the land covered by the McKi£trick Sun-

set map? I sent in a request for the withdrawal sometime ago but have heard noth-

ing from it. Do you know whether the suggestion was acted upon by the Land Office?

A memorandum should also be sent to the Land Office protesting against the issuing

of patents to oil land on gypsum development work. This gypsum ruse to obtain

oil land is one of the biggest steals that has ever been tried in this part of the country.

All of the men who are working it admit they want the land for oil. If these men

are allowed to use this method it will be but a short time until there is no vacant

oil land whatever. And the gypsum proposition is being resorted to by the biggest

companies, I am sorry to say companies that ought to have better business standards.

Cannot something be done now to stop this sort of thing. This is the most important

problem in the government land side of our work here, and it certainly needs prompt

and permanent treatment.

Our geological work is going on nicely. We will not be able to entirely cover the

area mapped in the McKittrick Sunset sheet, but we will finish the most important

parts.

Mr. Campbell and Mr. White spent four days with me and saw all of the fields from

Sunset to Coalinga. They were well impressed with the magnificent way in which

the geology shows up on the bare hills. I expect to arrive in Washington by October

31st.

Very truly yours,

RALPH ARNOLD.

WITHDRAWAL OF OCTOBER 2, 1908.

The Honorable,

SEPTEMBER 28, 1908. '

The SECRETARY OF THE INTERIOR.

SIR:

I am in receipt, under date of September 17, 1908,1 of a letter from Mr. George Otia

Smith, Director of the Geological Survey, recommending the temporary withdrawal

of certain lands in the Coalinga oil district, Visalia land district, California, in order

that drilling tests for oil may be completed therein.

His reasons for making this request are set forth in his letter from which I quote the

following:

Under date of August 15, 1907, the Acting Secretary of the Interior directed you to temporarily withdraw certain lands near Coalinga, Cal., pending examination by the Geological Survey. On June 19,1908,1 sent you a list of lands in the Coalinga district which had been classified as mineral lands by the geologists, and requested that those be withdrawn from any but mineral land entry. The basis for the classification was' given, and the belief was expressed that all the lands lying between the north line of T. 19 S and the south line of T. 24 S, M. D. M., and between the west line of R. 14 E. and east line of R. 19 E., are non-mineral bearing, in so far as petroleum is concerned.
I am now. informed by Geologist Arnold that among the lands thus restored to agricultural entry there are some tracts which are considered oil lands by operators in the Coalinga field. Three companies at least have started wells in the territory under question, and two of these three have expended at least $50,000 each in drilling.
As soon as the land in the vicinity of these' 'wild-cat" wells was thrown open to homestead entry, filings were made on all of the land around these prospect wells, irre-

spective of whether or not there were mineral filings on the same. In fact, the quarters filed on by the oil men were the ones most eagerly sought by the "scrippers ".
As a matter of opinion, the geologists believe that the classification of land [sic] June is correct, but as a matter of policy it seems to them that an effort should be made to protect these operators long enough to allow them to prove or disprove their belief that the land in question is oil bearing.
The land in question lies south of Coalinga, and is pronounced by the geologists as having little or no agricultural value, and in this opinion I concur, from my own observations last year. I recommend that the debatable strip, including the lands described below, be again temporarily withdrawn from agricultural entry, pending the exploration in progress by the oil men. I am confident that the operators are acting in good faith, and deserve protection, inasmuch as they are backing their judgment by large expenditures in drilling. I have discussed the matter with Secretary Garfield, and he authorizes me to express his approval of this recommendation, provided there are no complications other than those set forth.

The lands involved herein, together with other lands adjoining, were withdrawn from agricultural entry "pending investigation of the character thereof by the Geological Survey" by office letter of August 21, 1908, under direction of the Acting Secretary of the Interior dated August 15,1907, and were restored to all forms of entry

by office letter of July 10,1908, approved by the Department, on the recommendation of the Director of the Geological Survey under date of June 17, 1908.

In view of the facts set forth by the Honorable Director, I concur in his conclusions, and recommend that the lands be temporarily withdrawn from agricultural entry pending the completion of the drilling tests now going on.
A list of the lands for which withdrawal is requested is attached herewith. Very respectfully,

LETTER OF OCTOBER 24, 1908, FROM DIRECTOR TO SECRETARY.

The Honorable,

OCTOBER 24, 1908.

The SECRETARY OF THE INTERIOR.

SIR:

I desire to bring to your attention an extreme case of the waste of a mineral resource

in the United States, in the hope that the legal officers of the Department may be

able to suggest some method of conservation. The Chief Geologist of the Survey,

C. W. Hayes, recently visited the Caddo oil field in Louisiana, in company with David

T. Day, who is in charge of the Survey's investigation into the subject of oil production.

The Chief Geologist's report is as follows:

This field is located about twenty-five miles northwest of Shreveport, Louisiana, in Caddo Parish. The field, as at present outlined by the preliminary well drilling, is very narrow and extends for some ten miles in a northwest and southeast direction. There is every indication of further extension of the field to the north and southeast. In fact, no definite limitations have as yet been determined for the field, and it may be safely assumed from present conditions that it is likely to be of much greater extent.
This field has only lately come into prominence as a producer of petroleum, but for several years has given evidence of very great natural gas pressure, and several gas wells have been connected by pipe lines, first with Shreveport and. later with Texarkana, by six and eight inch pipe lines respectively,

15211° Bull. 623 16 8

114

PETROLEUM WITHDRAWALS AND RESTORATIONS.

Some four years ago one of the natural gas wells in this field began to leak badly around the casing due to poor work in packing the well above the gas-bearing sand. This leakage rapidly increased so that the well soon "blew out", that is, the pressure of the gas blew the pipe out of the ground and tore away the surrounding earth, and the pipe, derrick, drilling apparatus, etc. all fell into the well and were submerged by water which blew out with the gas. The gas, under heavy pressure, continued blowing out from this well for about four years. It was gradually drowned put by salt water, and eventually the escape of gas ceased. This blowing out from indifferent work in packing the wells has been repeated in three other cases, and at the present time the gas is boiling up so rapidly around the casing of a.fifth well that another "blow out" can be expected within a short time. In one well a crater about three hundred feet in diameter has been formed, which is usually about half filled with water or thin mud containing some petroleum. In the middle of this the gas boils up making a large mud volcano, and periodically the entire crater fills with oil and water overflowing into Caddo Lake.
It is absolutely impossible to measure the waste of gas from this well which has been in progress about two years; but it has been estimated by various persons familiar with gas wells at fifteen million cubic feet in twenty-four hours. Still greater waste of this valuable natural fuel is going on at a dry well about a mile due west of the well noted above. Here the gas is burning with a flame varying from seventy to one hundred feet in height, and the waste is evidently greater than in any other well in the field. In both of these wells enough of the casing remains in place to prevent the caving of the sides which might in time check or entirely stop the flow of gas. The total waste in this only partially developed field has been estimated as at least 75,000,000 cubic feet per day or over 1700 tons. This is more than one twentieth of the total amount of natural gas usefully consumed in the entire United States.
No effort is being made to control these wells, and there is no record in the history of the United States of such wanton waste with absolutely no effort to check it.
The engineering problem of putting down a series of wells within two hundred feet of these burning wells is extremely simple, and it could be confidently expected that such wells, properly drilled, would draw off the gas and so reduce the pressure until the blown out wells could be controlled and safely filled in. No such attempt is being made because the oil men have the fanciful belief that after the gas has blown off the production of oil will be improved an idea for which there is no justification, as this rapid escape of gas rather injures _the oil chances of the field by permitting an influx of salt water as the gas pressure is removed. The apparent real reason for this profligate waste is that there is no immediate use for the gas beyond that supplied now for Shreveport and Texarkana, and the sensational exhibition of this burning gas at night is a spectacle which will advertise the field to those passing through on trains..
An investigation of this oil field in cooperation with the Geological Survey of Louisiana is now in progress and additional information concerning it will be available in a short time.
It has been suggested that if any federal lands remain in this vicinity, there might be some basis for injunction to stop this needless waste. It is evident that engineering difficulties of considerable magnitude are involved, but the geologists of the Survey believe that the operators will be able to control the gas if a serious endeavor is made.
Very respectfully, GEO. OTIS SMITH
Director. '

The waste of natural gas referred to in my previous letter on this subject constitutes an evident drain upon the mineral resources of the public domain. If permitted to continue it will inevitably destroy the mineral value of this public land, and render it worthless in a comparatively short time. If the Government, by reason of these holdings, can ask for an injunction against further drilling for oil or gas within the area of the Caddo field until effective measures are taken both to stop the present waste of gas and to insure wells now being drilled

116

against similar'' blowing out,'' I would recommend that this action be taken. Whether

such an injunction is not possible, the determination of the conditions necessary for

the protection of the Government and other property in this vicinity might well be

entrusted to a commission to consist of a member of the Geological Survey, a member

of the General Land Office and the State Geologist of Louisiana.

I have the honor to further recommend that all the lands described herein be with-

drawn from entry pending the investigation now under way as to their value for oil

and gas and also that all public lands in Texas within a width of two sections from the

Louisiana line opposite the tract between Townships 18 and 20 in Louisiana be simi-

larly withdrawn from entry.

UNITED STATES GEOLOGICAL SURVEY,

Washington, D. C. SIR:

In the preparation of the tables of production of petroleum and the comparison of these with the estimated supply, for the report of the Conservation Commission, it has become manifest that the necessity for conserving our supply stands in a class by

itself, and that the withdrawal of public lands known to contain petroleum is an immediate necessity for the adequate supply of this material during the remainder of

the century, or even for the next fifty years.

This condition is due not to the popularity of petroleum, but to the character of the

production, which consists in realizing on the petroleum contained in one lease before

it can be pumped through the wells of an adjoining lease. This situation renders

imperative favorable action on the recommendation made last year in the letter of

which we inclose a copy.1

Dr. G. OTIS SMITH,

DECEMBER 16, 1908.

Director, U. 8. Geological Survey,

t-

Washington, D. C.

MY DEAR DR. SMITH:

As I understand it the present status of the withdrawals of the oil lands in California

is this: For the area mapped in the Coalinga report, permanent withdrawal from any

but mineral locations for those lands classified as possible oil-bearing. For the region

north from the Coalinga district to near San Francisco Bay, withdrawal from all entry

including mineral, pending classification of the land by the Survey. For the region

included on the Sunset-McKittrick sheet temporary withdrawal from all location

except mineral entry.

In view of the fact that the most promising territory yet remaining in the possession

of the government lies within the Coalinga district and the McKittrick-Sunset districts,

I would suggest that you request the withdrawal from all entry of that land in the

Coalinga district which has been classified as possible oil-bearing, and also of all the

land included in the Sunset-McKittrick district pending appropriate action by Con-

gress. This withdrawal from all entry in the Sunset-McKittrick district is made the

more necessary by the fact that it includes large areas in which the gypsum question

is an important one.

If you so desire I can furnish descriptions of the lands roughly described above.

Very respectfully,

RALPH ARNOLD

Paleontologist.

EXTRACTS FROM LETTER OF JUNE 4, 1909, FROM DIRECTOR TO SECRETARY.

The Honorable,

JUNE 4, 1909.

The SECRETARY OP THE INTERIOR.

SIR:

On September 14, 1908, 1 Secretary Garfield, in order to prevent conflict between

agricultural and mineral claimants, withdrew from entry certain lands in the McKitt-

rick-Sunset oil districts of California, pending classification by the Geological Survey.

About two-thirds of this area has been examined by the Survey and the remainder is

now being examined. Of the portion already examined, I classify 430,340 acres as

oil land, and 544,480 acres as not oil land. Lists of these lands are given in the accom-

panying letter to the Commissioner which is transmitted through you in order that

certain matters connected therewith may be considered.

%%%%%%%% %%%%%%%

I would suggest that it might be possible for you to meet this difficulty by permitting

only oil locations on the land classed as "oil land." In the withdrawal of November

7,1908, this would amount to merely suspending the present withdrawal from all entry

only so far as to permit oil locations on the lands classed as oil land. In this event,

registers and receivers would be informed that the lands classified as "oil" are "tem-

porarily withdrawn from all except oil entry or location pending action by Congress".

There is now before the House a bill (No. 9771) which would correct this trouble,

although it is objectionable in certain other features.

The lands classified and reported as not oil bearing would of course be released from

all withdrawals.

Very respectfully,

GEO. OTIS SMITH

Director.

SIR:

I am in receipt of petitions from the Mammoth Oil & Gas Company of Vale, Oregon,

and other corporations and individuals, requesting the withdrawal from entry of cer-

tain lands in Malheur County, Oregon, stated to be unfit for agricultural or grazing and

chiefly valuable for their deposits of petroleum oil and gas. The purpose of the with-

drawal is stated to be that the lands may be prospected and exploited for their mineral

deposits. The tracts involved are described as follows:

Sections 15, 21 to 28, and 33 to 35, inclusive, all in township 19 South, range 43 E.

W. M.; sections 14, 15, 17 to 20, S./2 of 21, and°22 to 35, inclusive, all in township 19

South, range 44, E. W. M.; sections 2, 4, 8, 10, 14, 15, 17 to 22, 24, 26, and 28 to 34,

inclusive, all in township 19 South, range 45 E. W. M.; sections 18 and 30 in township

19 South, range 46, E. W. M.; sections 1, 2, 3, E./2 4, 10 to 15, 22 to 27, inclusive, all

in township 20 South, range 43, E. W. M.; sections 1 to 7, 9 to 14,17 to 19, and 23 to 25,

inclusive, all in township 20 South, range 44, E. W. M.; sections 2 to 15, 17 to 21, and

28 to 30, inclusive, all in township 20 South, range 45 E. W. M.; sections 8, N./2, 18,

and 32, all in township 17 South, range 45, E. W. M.; sections 4 and 10, township 18

South, range 45, E. W. M.

In view of the decisions of the courts to the 'effect that there can be no reservation

of public lands from sale except when authorized by some treaty, law or authorization from Congress, I must hold that I am not authorized to withdraw the land for the purpose indicated. However, there has been introduced in Congress a bill, Senate 2623, which proposes radical changes in the method of acquiring and disposing of pxiblic lands of the United States containing deposits of oil and, in view of the pendency of this legislation and of the further fact that lands in the State of California, withdrawn by my predecessor, and classified as containing deposits of oil, are withheld from entry

because of pending legislation of this nature, I have to direct that the lands here involved be temporarily withdrawn from all forms of location and disposal under the public land laws, subject to valid existing rights, pending consideration by Congress

at its next session of the bills hereinbefore described. You will make appropriate notations upon your records and advise the local land

officers hereof.

Applications, selections, entries and proofs based upon locations, settlements, or right initiated prior to the date of withdrawal may be received by the local land officers and allowed to proceed under the rules up to and including the submission of final proofs. The purchase money will not be received or final certificates of entry issued in nonmineral cases pending investigation as to the validity of the claims with

regard to the character of the land.

LETTER OF SEPTEMBER 17, 1909, FROM DIRECTOR TO SECRETARY.

The Honorable, THE SECRETARY OF THE INTERIOR.

SEPTEMBER. 17, 1909.

SIR: I have the honor to transmit herewith a copy of a letter addressed to your prede-
cessor in February, 1908. l The arguments presented in support of the recommendation made at that time are still valid, and they have been amplified in the Survey's Conservation report on the petroleum resources of the United States,2 a copy of which I submit herewith. In this report it is shown that the present production of petroleum exceeds the legitimate demands of the trade and that inasmuch as the disposal of the public petroleum lands at nominal prices simply encourages overproduction the logical method of checking this unnecessary waste would be to secure the enactment of legislation that would provide for the sane development of this important resource. In view of the well known facts of the mode of occurrence of oil and the all too common practice of drilling wells close to boundary lines of private holdings that are being developed for oil, conservation of the petroleum supply demands a law that

will provide for disposal of the oil remaining in the public domain in terms of barrels

of oil rather than of acres of land.

1 have the honor to also call your attention to the estimate in the petroleum report that at least one-half pint of lubricating oil is used for every ton of coal converted into power, and that this quantity of lubricating oil represents over a half-gallon of crude

. petroleum. Taking this into account as well as the increasing use of fuel oil by the American Navy there Avould appear to be an immediate necessity for assuring the conservation of a proper supply of petroleum for the Government's own use. I would therefore renew my recommendation that pending the enactment of adequate legislation on this subject, the filing of claims to oil land in the State of California be

suspended. In this connection it is important to note that acting on my report of June 4, 1909,3
classifying certain oil lands in California, the Commissioner of the General Land Office issued instructions to Registers and Receivers to withhold those oil lands from agricultural entry pending consideration of the question of legislation. The area of oil land affected by this action is about 427,000 acres, to at least 40 per cent of which the Government retains title. In several townships, notably T. 32 S, R. 22 E.; T.

32 S., R. 23 E.; T. 32 S., R. 21 E.; T. 30 S, R. 21 E.; T. 31 S., R. 23 E.; T. 31 S., R. 22 E.; T. 31 S., R. 24 E. of the Mount Diablo Meridian; and in T. 11 N., R. 24 W., and T. 12 N., R. 25 W., of the San Bernardino Meridian, there are com-

Very respectfully, GEO. OTIS SMITH Director.

LETTER OF SEPTEMBER 17, 1909, FROM SECRETARY TO PRESIDENT.

SEPTEMBER 17,1909. The PRESIDENT,
White House. SIR:
I have the honor to bring to yoar attention the subject of the conservation of the petroleum resources of the public domain, with special reference to the present and future requirements of the American Navy.
The six largest battleships in commission or under construction are equipped for the use of either oil or coal and the fourteen latest destroyers use oil exclusively.
The Geological Survey reports that the present rate of production of petroleum can not be maintained beyond a very few years, after which a marked decrease will result in an insufficient supply and increased prices. At present the production exceeds the legitimate demands of the trade and inasmuch as the disposal of the public petroleum lands at nominal prices simply encourages overproduction the logical method of checking this unnecessary waste would be to secure the enactment of legislation that would provide for the sane development of this important resource. In view of the well known facts of the mode of occurrence of oil and the all too common practice of drilling wells close to boundary lines 0? private holdings that are being developed for oil, conservation of the petroleum supply demands a law that will provide for the disposal of the oil remaining in the public domain in terms of barrels of oil rather than of acres of land.
The Navy has a further interest in the conservation of the petroleum supply by reason of the absolutely necessary use of petroleum products for lubrication. A very conservative estimate is that at least one-half pint of lubricating oil is used for every ton of coal converted into power and that this quantity of lubricating oil represents over a half-gallon of crude petroleum.
The recommendation was made by the Director of the Geological Survey in February, 1908 1 to my predecessor that the riling of claims to oil land in the State of California be suspended in order that the Government may continue the ownership of a sufficient supply of petroleum on the Pacific Coast where other fuel is expensive. No action to this end has been taken.
Acting upon the Survey's report of June 4, 1909,2 classifying oil lands in California, the Commissioner of the General Land Office on June 22, 1909 issued instructions to the Registers and Receivers to withhold these oil lands from agricultural entry, pending consideration of the question of legislation. The area classified as oil land is 430,000 acres, to at least 40 per cent of which the Government still retains title. In several townships in this tract there are compact areas of unappropriated oil land, each including from 6 to 16 contiguous square miles.
As a result of previous work by the Geological Survey similar action was taken in June, 1908 3 on 150,240 acres in California, classified as oil land, the title to a considerable portion of which is believed to remain in the Government. Furthermore there is at present withdrawn in California pending examination and classification by the Geological Survey, which work is now in progress, approximately 1,650,000 acres, of which 1,250,000 acres are withdrawn from all entry.

The time appears opportune for legislative action that will assure the conservation of an adequate supply of petroleum for the Government's own needs. This legislation should give authority to fix the terms of disposition of public oil lands so as to provide for the future demands of the Navy and should also authorize the permanent reservation of such areas as the Executive, after full investigation, may find necessary for .this Federal purpose. It is believed that such legislation would not interfere with the profitable development and utilization of the California oil pools.
In aid of such legislation and indeed as essential to the accomplishment of its purpose, all the lands hereinbefore mentioned should be temporarily withdrawn from all forms of filing, entry and disposal, including mineral entry.
I have the honor to be, Very respectfully, R A BALLINGER
Secretary.

The Honorable,

SEPTEMBER 27, 1909.

The SECRETARY OF THE INTERIOR. SIR:

In accordance with your orders I have the honor to submit the following recommenda-

tion which covers approximately 3,041,000 acres of which the larger part is probably

private land and not affected by this withdrawal.

TEMPORARY PETROLEUM WITHDRAWAL No. 5.

In aid of proposed legislation affecting the use and disposition of the petroleum deposits on the public domain, all public lands in the accompanying lists are hereby temporarily withdrawn from, all forms of location, settlement, selection, filing, entry, or disposal under the mineral or non-mineral public land laws. All locations or claims existing and valid on this date may proceed to entry in the usual manner after field investigation and examination.

1 This order declared valid by decision of the United States Supreme Court in the case of the United States vs. The Midwest Oil Company, handed down February 23, 1915 (230 U. S. 459).

RESTORATION AND WITHDRAWAL OF APRIL 14, 1910.
APRIL 11, 1910. The Honorable,
The SECRETARY OP THE INTERIOR. SIR:
Field investigations just completed show that certain lands in existing oil withdrawals are not oil lands. I therefore recommend the restoration of the following areas:
Salt Lake Meridian, Utah.

T. 43 S., R. 17 W., Sees. 4 to 9,16 to 22, 26 to 36, inclusive. The same field investigations show that it is advisable to withdraw the following lands in aid of proposed legislation affecting the use and disposition of the petroleum deposits, and I therefore submit the following recommendation of withdrawal which involves approximately 407,314 acres.

TEMPORARY PETROLEUM WITHDRAWAL No. 15.

In aid of proposed legislation affecting the use and disposition of the petroleum deposits on the public domain, all public lands in the following list are hereby temporarily withdrawn from all forms of location, settlement,^ selection, filing, entry, or disposal under the mineral or nonmineral public-land laws. All locations or claims existing and valid on this date may proceed to entry in the usual manner after field investigation and examination.

As portions of the lands included within this withdrawal are unsurveyed, it is

requested that appropriate notation be made on the records to show the withdrawal

thereof while unsurveyed as well as after survey has been made.

The effect of these changes is to increase the total area withdrawn 91,072 acres,

making the total area now covered by withdrawals in aid of proposed legislation

affecting the use and disposition of petroleum deposits on the public domain approx-

imately 3,864,631 acres.

PETROLEUM WITHDRAWALS AND RESTORATIONS.

RESTORATION OF APRIL 30, 1910. APRIL 28, 1910.
The Honorable, The SECRETARY OF THE INTERIOR.
SIR: In response to urgent request of January 24, 1910, from M. B. Gearon of Chicago,
that withdrawn oil lands in southwestern Utah, be examined at once in order that a decision might be reached with regard to proposed Carey Act selections in which Mr. Gearon is interested:
On February 4, 1910, I sent Geologist Kobert Anderson, to make an examination of the area. It appears from the report of Mr. Anderson that for the most part the lands involved in this Carey Act selection either have no oil value or that the prospective value of the irrigated lands will be many times the prospective oil value.
On April 11, 1910, l I recommended the restoration of lands in this field which are not underlain by the oil-bearing rocks. These lands were restored on April 14. I now recommend the restoration of the following tracts because the land is more valuable for agricultural uses than as oil land.

Salt Lake Meridian, Utah.
T. 43 S., R. 10 W., Sees. 4 to 9, 16 to 21, 28 to 33 inclusive. T. 42 S., R. 11 W., Sees. 19 to 36 inclusive. T. 43S.,R. 11 W., All. T. 42 S., R. 12 W., All. T. 43 S., R. 12 W., All.

Salt Lake Meridian, Arizona.
All portions of the following townships, which may be found to lie south of the thirty-seventh parallel of north latitude:
T. 43 S., R. 10 W., W£ of township. T. 43'S., Rs. 11, 12, 13, and 14 W. The area involved in this recommendation of restoration is approximately 116,482 acres, and its approval will leave 581,566 acres still withdrawn in the State of Utah in aid of proposed legislation affecting the use and disposition of petroleum deposits on the public domain. From the report of the field geologist I do not deem it advisable to recommend the restoration of the other lands which Mr. Gearon desires to be restored.

WITHDRAWAL AND RESTORATION OF JUNE 18, 1910.
JUNE 16, 1910. The Honorable,
The SECRETARY OF THE INTERIOR. SIR:
On November 10, 1900, 2 an area of approximately 552,960 acres in the Salt Creek region, Wyoming, was withdrawn from agricultural entry on recommendation of the Commissioner of the General Land Office on account of alleged oil character of the land. On September 27, 1901, 3 following field examination by a special agent, approximately 92,160 acres of this area were restored. On April 1,1903, 4 an additional restoration was made, leaving an outstanding withdrawal covering 173,530 acres. On July 26, 1909, 5 you approved a recommendation of the Commissioner that this withdrawal be continued pending examination by the Geological Survey. As this examination was not completed at the time of the initiation of the policy of withdrawing oil lands from all disposition in aid of proposed legislation, this area was included in Temporary Petroleum Withdrawal No. 5, approved by you on September 27, 1909. 8
As a result of field examination by the Geological Survey in this area, I find that the following lands included in this withdrawal are not valuable for oil and accordingly3 recommend their restoration. This recommendation of restoration includes 139,135 acres.

has now been completed, and the data obtained show that the following lands included

iu this withdrawal are not valuable for oil, and I accordingly recommend that these

lands be restored. This recommendation of restoration includes 20,424 acres.

The SECRETARY OF THE INTERIOR. SIR:
Under date of November 7, 1910, F. C. Dezendorf, Chief of Field Division, telegraphed to the Commissioner of the General Land Office a reported oil discovery in the vicinity of Red Rock Canyon, Kern County, California, and suggested the withdrawal of the lands involved. This telegram was referred to the Geological Survey and resulted in Petroleum Reserve No. 15 California No. 6, which the President approved on November 25, 1910.' I am now in receipt by reference from your office and from the General Land Office of the report, approved by Chief of Field Division Dezendorf, of two mineral inspectors who have investigated the vicinity of the reputed oil strike and who recommend that the withdrawn lands be restored to entry. This report has been considered in the light of the Survey's information and I recommend the following order of restoration which involves 5,760 acres, which will leave a total area of petroleum withdrawals outstanding in California of 2,486,255 acres.
Very respectfully, GEO. OTIS SMITH Director.

RESTORATION OF MARCH 14, 1911.

The Honorable, The SECRETARY OF THE INTERIOR.

MARCH 10,1911.

SIR: On January 21,1911, 1 1 recommended the withdrawal of certain lands in Wyoming
for the reason that they are indicated by field investigation to be valuable for oil and

gas. The General Land Office now reports that lot 4, Sec. 3, and SE. £ of SW. £,

S. i af SE. i, Sec. 4, T. 52 N., R. 93 W., which were included in the withdrawal, form part of Wyoming Carey Act Segregation List No. 61, which was approved January 4, 1911. The geological evidence regarding these lands, which are on the border of the withdrawn area, indicates a strong possibility that they are oil or gas bearing but the probability is not great enough to warrant the withholding of the tracts from irrigation and settlement. I therefore recommend their restoration, together with that of certain lots which the records of the General Land Office show to be patented. This recommendation involves 1,024 acres, which will leave a total area of petroleum

withdrawals outstanding in Wyoming of 1,594,308 acres. Very respectfully, GEO. OTIS SMITH Director.

SIR:

Under dates of October 13, 1911, and October 16, 1911, the General Land Office

requested that the lands listed below, now included in Petroleum Reserve No. 19-

Wyoming No. 4, 1 be restored in order to permit the correction of the patent of William

Denecke so as to include these lands, Denecke having been in possession and control

thereof since April 20,1911, but the patent given by him having erroneously described

the SE. I of NW. }, SW. £ of NE. £, Sec. 29, of the same township. The probability

of occurrence of oil is no greater with respect to the land occupied by Denecke than

with respect to the land to which patent has been granted him. In order, therefore,

that the desired correction may be made in the patent, I recommend the submission

to the -President of the following order of restoration involving 80 acres, which will

leave a total area of petroleum withdrawals outstanding in Wyoming of 398,402 acres.

These lands are not included in power-site reserves or,in national forests.

LETTER OF OCTOBER 11, 1913, FROM PRESIDENT TO SECRETARY.

BEVERLY, MASSACHUSETTS,

OCTOBER 11, 1912.

MY DEAR MR. SECRETARY:

Your attention is called to the fact that by the approval, on August 24, 1912, l of

the act of Congress entitled "An Act to amend section two of an act to authorize the

President of the United States to make withdrawals of public lands in certain cases,

approved June twenty-fifth, nineteen hundred and ten" (Public No. 316), all out-

standing orders of withdrawal under the act of June 25, 1910 (36 Stat., 847), were

modified to conform to the act approved June 25,1910, as amended by the act approved

August 24, 1912.

Those charged temporarily with receiving applications to enter public lands should

have their attention called to this most important amendment and be directed to

enforce it, as indicated.

Sincerely yours,

WM H TAFT

Hon. WALTER L. FISHER,

Secretary of the Interior.

Los Angeles, California. SIRS:
On January 4, 1901, Messrs. Hendricks and Wright, of San Diego, California, petitioned this office for the suspension from entry of certain described lands because:
"A large number of individuals, residents of the State of California have discovered xxx superficial mineral deposits not in place, consisting of large quantities of gypsum, which lands also contain strong surface indications of petroleum xxx and in pursuance of the custom of miners in the mining districts of the State of California posted notices, of their several mining locations upon said lands at point of discovery."

Affidavits in support of said petition were submitted, and a letter from H. P. Wood, San Diego, California, calling particular attention to the necessity for the desired action.
By office letter N of March 7,1901, J the petition was granted, for a reasonable period, to allow the mineral claimants an opportunity to develop the mining claims. Said letter held that the suspension was not to interfere with the due consideration of any claim or contest pending at the date of receipt of said letter, and you were directed to advise parties:
'' that this will conclude all notice to them under their said petition, as under the rules, publication is required of all entries or selections within six miles of mining claims, during which specific protests may be filed."
The following are the lands suspended by this letter:
West one half (£) of Section twenty-four (24), Sections twenty-three (23), twentytwo (22), twenty-seven (27), twenty-six (26), and twenty-five (25) of township fifteen (15) South, range eight (8) east San Bernarclino Base and Meridian.

Southwest quarter of section nineteen (19), West one half of section thirty (30), west one half of section thirty-one (31) Township fifteen (15) South, range eleven (11) east, San Bernardino Base and Meridian.
Sections one (1), two (2), three (3), ten (10), eleven (11), twelve (12), thirteen (13), fourteen (14), fifteen (15), twenty-two (22), east half of section four (4), east half of section nine (9), east half of section sixteen (16), East half of section twenty-one 21), northeast quarter of section twenty-eight (28), North half of section twenty-seven 27), Northwest quarter of section twenty-six (26), West half of section twenty-three 23), northeast quarter of section twenty-three (23), North half of section twenty-four 24), Township sixteen (16) South, Range ten (10) east, San Bernardino Base and Meridian.

As stated in said office letter, the suspension was temporary, to allow parties to develop their alleged mining claims. The greater part of the lands above described are now surveyed, and the records fail to show any applications for the same, under the United States mining laws, and in view of the length of time that has elapsed since their suspension, and that ample protection is provided, under the public land laws, for parties who may have mining locations on the land, where title is sought for the

NAVAL RESERVE OF DECEMBER 13, 1912.

DECEMBER 6, 1912.

The Honorable,

The SECRETARY OF THE INTERIOR.

SIR:

As a result of recent investigations of conditions in Naval Petroleum Reserve No. 1 2

in the Elk Hills, California, by. the Geological Survey, the difficulty of estimating

definitely the quantity of oil available within this reserve has been developed more

fully than heretofore. It is deemed the part of prudence therefore to add to the area

especially reserved, in order that there may be as complete assurance as possible that

the United States retains control over a body of fuel oil adequate for the future needs

of the United States Navy. I have therefore prepared, and recommend for submis-

sion to the President, the following additional order of withdrawal, involving approxi-

mately 29,541 acres in the Buena Vista Hills, Kern County, California.

Very respectfully,

GEO. OTIS SMITH

On June 19, 1909, * the lands in southeastern Oregon listed below were withdrawn

the lands were believed to contain valuable deposits of oil or gas, and requesting their

withdrawal. The withdrawal of June 19,1909, was ratified, confirmed, and continued

by Executive Order of July 2, 1910, 2 as Petroleum Reserve No. 6. Subsequent in-

vestigations of the oil and gas possibilities of this region indicate that although small

LETTER OF JUNE 7, 1913, FROM WYOMING DELEGATION TO SECRETARY.

Hon. FRANKLIN K. LANE,

JUNE 7, 1913.

Secretary of the Interior.

SIR: We are enclosing herewith petitions signed by good and representative citizens

of Basin and Greybull, Wyoming, requesting the restoration to entry of lands in the

vicinity of these towns now withdrawn as oil and gas lands.

The situation briefly is as follows: A number of years ago, after considerable drill-

ing in the locality, a gas well was developed near the town of Greybull. After many

vicissitudes and much delay capital was secured and a considerable number of wells

were drilled and pipe lines were laid to supply Basin, ten miles distant, and Grey-

bull, with gas. Last year the supply from these wells proving inadequate, further

wells were drilled on patented lands but they have not materially added to the sup-

ply. The company operating in this field has, we are informed, found it difficult to

secure funds for further drilling on lands on which they applied for patent several

years ago and now await action on the third inspection of the said lands which has

been ordered by the General Land Office.

Some time since, all public lands in the vicinity which gave promise of yielding

oil or gas were withdrawn from all forms of entry, and it is the restoration of these

lands which is now sought. We cannot urge too strongly upon you the importance,

to the people of the towns of Basin and Greybull and the surrounding country, of

having an opportunity given for the further development of this gas and oil field.

The people have discarded their stoves and furnaces for gas ranges and heaters, and

now find the gas supply wholly inadequate for their needs, with every prospect of a

complete failure of supply unless more territory is opened to exploration. Those

who have, with great courage, made large investments to prove the extent and value

of the field are threatened with a total loss of all investment, while a very consider-

able area of lands believed to be oil and gas producing mostly barren hills having

no other value whatever are tied up by withdrawal. We most earnestly urge that

relief be granted at once in order that drilling may be speedily undertaken, as the

region is one in which it is practically impossible to drill after winter sets in.

Very truly yours,

LETTER OF JULY 7, 1913, FROM SECRETARY TO SENATOR WARREN.

Hon. F. E. WARREN, United States Senate.
MY DEAR SENATOR:

JULY.7, 1913.

I have given full consideration to your letters of May 31, June 2, and June 5, 1913, and to that signed jointly by yourself, Senator Clark, and Representative Mondell, dated June 7, 1913, l together with the various communications from Mayor Blackley of Greybull and other citizens of Greybull and Basin, Wyoming." As a result of this consideration it appears to me that the economic conditions in the two communities, as set forth in these various communications, are of unusual character and justify special action by the Department for their relief. For the benefit of these communities, therefore, it is proposed that the Mayor of Greybull shall designate two compact areas not exceeding 160 acres each in extent within the limits of Petroleum Reserve No. 8, approved in July, 1910, or Petroleum Reserve No. 17, approved in January, 1911, and that after the selection of these areas the outstanding petroleum withdrawals will be so modified as to permit the location under existing laws of these two tracts as petroleum placer claims on behalf of such person or persons as the Mayor of Greybull shall name. The testing of these claims for the purpose of obtaining a supply of gas for the citizens of Greybull and Basin and adjacent communities may then
proceed until the fuel supply is secured, or until the lands are proven nonproductive. In the latter event, determined to the satisfaction of the Department, additional modifications may be made and additional tests permitted if the citizens and the
operating companies shall desire and the conditions at that time appear to warrant such action.
This plan I believe will afford your communities the desired opportunity to secure additional fuel supplies if they exist within the area at present withdrawn. It will at the same time result in the minimum of interference with the cooperative legislative and executive action in aid of additional legislation which is represented by the withdrawal act and the withdrawals that are made by the authority of that act.
Yours very sincerely, FRANKLIN K LANE

RESTORATION OF NOVEMBER 13, 1913.
NOVEMBER 5,1913. The Honorable,
The SECRETARY OP THE INTERIOR. SIR:
The lands listed below were examined by geologists of the Survey in 1905 and again in 1906. These examinations show the lands to be underlain by the Aspen shales, which bear oil in the Spring Valley field to the south and in the LaBarge field to the northeast, and indicate a structure rather favorable for oil accumulation. On the basis of these facts the lands were included in Petroleum Withdrawal No. 6, approved October 12, 1909, 1 and ratified as part of Petroleum Reserve No. 8 on July 2, 1910.2 A report by a mineral inspector of the General Land Office shows a well to have been drilled on one of the two forties listed to a depth of 1620 feet, without encountering more than enough oil to discolor the water. While this well is not conclusive as to the nonoil character of the land, in that it did not penetrate the full thickness (about 2,000 feet) of the Aspen shales, it nevertheless passed through that part of the shales in which most of the oil has been found elsewhere, and thus so reduces the possibility of oil under the land that the petroleum withdrawal is no longer warranted. The oil in the Aspen shales has been shown to be "pockety," and the distance is small to which a single well proves or disproves surrounding territory. The recommendation for restoration is therefore confined to 80 acres, none of the area being included in coal, phosphate, or power-site reserves, or in national forests.
Respectfully, GEO. OTIS SMITH Director.

MODIFICATION OF NOVEMBER 14, 1913.

OCTOBER 29, 1913.

The Honorable,

The SECRETARY OF THE INTERIOR.

SIR:

In order to permit a further test of withdrawn oil and gas lands in Wyoming for the

purpose of obtaining a supply of natural gas to relieve the fuel famine in the cities of

Greybull and Basin, Wyoming, I recommend the approval of the accompanying order

of modification involving 160 acres, and its submission thereafter to the President for

appropriate action.

Since the President's approval on August 2, 1913, 1 of a preceding order of modifica-

tion involving 320 acres, the representatives of the communities in question have drilled

five wells on the released lands, these wells ranging from 400 to nearly 1300 feet in

depth. They have penetrated the most favorable gas horizons and although small

quantities of oil were developed, gas in quantities available for use has not been found.

In view of these conditions I believe that further opportunity should be given the

municipalities interested to develop if possible a natural gas supply suitable for heating

and lighting purposes.

MAY 12,1915.

Sacramento, California.

SIRS:

By office letter "N" of September 5, 1900, 1 to the Marysville office the following

townships were suspended from disposition under agricultural laws until their alleged

oil character had been investigated:

Ts. 12, 13, 14 N., Rs. 2 and 3 W., M. D. M.

Ts. 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18 N., R. 4 W., M. D. M.

Ts. 13 to 22 inclusive N., R. 5 W., M. D. M.

Ts. 17 to 22 inclusive N., R. 6 W., M. D. M.

Ts. 20, 21, 22 N., R. 7 W., M. D. M.

By letter "N" of February 1C, 1904,2 to the Marysville office the suspension was

revoked as to all of the lands above described, except W. $ Sec. 6, W. $ Sec. 7 and

NW. i Sec. 19, T. 14 N., R. 5 W., Sees. 6 and 7, T. 15 N., R. 4 W., and T. 20 N.,

R. 5 W. This revocation was made as the result of an examination and recommenda-

tion by a special agent of this office.

The records show that by letter "N " of May 3, 1907,3 to your office, the lands being

in your district, the suspension of September 5, 1900, was further revoked as to the

W. i Sec. 6, W. £ Sec. 7, NW.}, Sec. 19, T. 14 N., R. 5 W., and Sees. 6 and 7, T. 15 N.,

R. 5 W., for the reason as stated in said letter that, "no further evidence has come

before this office showing that these sections contain valuable mineral (oil) deposits

and no applications or entries appear to have been made for lands covered thereby."

It will thus be seen that the original suspension has been revoked as to all of the lands

covered thereby except T. 20 N., R. 5 W., and it would appear from the wording of

said letter of May 3, 1907, that said township was not included therein for the reason

that it was thought that the revocation of February 10, 1904, to the Marysville office

covered said latter township; said letter of May 3, 1907 stating that the revocation

of February 10, covered all of the withdrawn lands except those restored therein.

It appears that the withdrawal of T. 20 N., R. 5 W., was continued on recommenda-

tion of a special agent in order that those persons who were in good faith endeavoring

to develop oil deposits on the land in the immediate vicinity may be encouraged and

protected.

The records show that the greater portion of the lands in said township are covered

by entries under the agricultural land laws made many years ago which have prob-

ably gone to patent. The lands have never been embraced in any petroleum with-

drawal, nor have they been reported as valuable for oil deposits and parties who were

prospecting the lands at date of withdrawal have had ample opportunity since their

withdrawal in 1900 to explore and develop the same.

There appears therefore no reason for a further continuance of the suspension as

to the lands in T. 20 N., R. 5 W., and it is accordingly hereby revoked.

Very respectfully,

CLAY TALLMAN

Commissioner.

The Honorable,

The SECRETARY OF THE INTERIOR. SIR:

A careful consideration of the data gathered by the Geological Survey during field

investigations indicates that the lands in north-central Wyoming hereinafter listed do

not contain valuable deposits of oil or gas. The following order of restoration (Petro-

leum Restoration No. 25, Wyoming No. 12), involving 4,910 acres, is therefore recom-

mended for submission to the President for appropriate action. These lands are not

included in potash or power-site reserves or in national forests, but parts of them are

included in coal and phosphate reserves.

A careful study of the field data collected by the Geological Survey, considered in

the light of recent developments in nearby areas, indicates that the lands in north-

central Wyoming hereinafter listed contain deposits of oil and gas. As these lands

are not now in petroleum withdrawal the following order (Petroleum Reserve No. 37,

Wyoming No. 13), involving 133,687 acres, is recommended for submission to the

President for appropriate action.

Respectfully,

GEO. OTIS SMITH

MAY 26 1915

Director.

Respectfully referred to the President

with favorable recommendation.

TOWNSHIP INDEX.

In the following index every order of withdrawal, classification, or restoration affecting lands in a township is given under the date on which the order was approved. Dates of recommendation of action and dates of notification to local land officers (registers and receivers) are not indexed, nor is correspondence other than official orders. Orders of modification to permit the approval of rights of way have not been listed in the index, but modifications to conform .to new surveys or to permit mineral location or the issuance of patent are
given. The index gives no intimation as to whether an order affects the
whole or only a part of the township. Thus a withdrawal may be followed by several restorations and the entire township not have been restored, and although "restoration" may be the last item listed, a part of the township may be still withdrawn. It follows that the index is not an indicator of present status, as to which the maps at the back of the bulletin (pocket) should be consulted. It should be noted also that no attempt has been made to indicate the type to which an order may belong whether'a withdrawal from agricultural entry or from all disposition, whether made by the Commissioner, the Secretary, or the President. Reference must be made to the wording and signature of the order itself to determine its character and the portion of the township which it affects.
The index is arranged (1) by States, (2) by meridians, alphabetically, (3) by quadrants in counter-clockwise order, north and east, north and west, south and west, south and east, (4) by ranges, and (5) by townships.

WYOMING.
SIXTH PRINCIPAL MERIDIAN.
This index does not include those townships in the Evanston land district east of Range 112 West, although departmental order of June 3,1902 (p. 72), was interpreted as suspending the issuance of patents to Union Pacific grant lands in those townships, and departmental order of December 30,1902 (p. 77), canceled the suspension. The terms of the order were so indefinite, the suspension was partial and of such brief duration, and the number of townships involved is . so large that it has not seemed worth while to index the order for these townships on which no further action of this nature has been taken.

The Honorable,

SEPTEMBER 8,1916.

The SECRETARY OF THE INTERIOR. SIR:

Field investigations by the Geological Survey indicate that the lands in south-

central Montana hereinafter listed contain deposits of oil and gas. As shown on the

General Land Office records some of the lands within this favorable area have been

patented to individuals and to the Northern Pacific Railroad Company. For that

reason such patented lands and school lands in Sees. 16 and 36 are not listed in the order

of withdrawal. The lands embraced in homestead entries upon which final certifi-

cates have not yet issued and unpatented railroad lands are included in the order,

as they fall within the purview of the act of July 17, 1914 (38 Stat., 509). As these

lands are not now in petroleum withdrawal the following order (Petroleum-Reserve

No. 49, Montana No. 4), involving 24,587 acres, is recommended for submission to

the President for appropriate action.

Respectfully, GEO. OTIS SMITH,
