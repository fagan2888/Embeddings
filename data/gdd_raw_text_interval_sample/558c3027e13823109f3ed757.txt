ABSTRACT
'
Channel samples of the commercially important coal beds and associated , rocks in the Pottsv::Ulel' Allegheeyl> and Monongahela series of the Pennsyl~n system were collected in eastern Ohioo Equivalent uranium content of 0.001 ~rcent or more was determ' ined in the laboratory for five sampleso The Ut"anium content of the coal is less than the equivalent uranium content indicated by radioactivity m.easurementsct None of the samples collected contain recoverable quantities of uranium in the asho
INTRODUCTION
\
The cotU-.bearing reeks of' Ohio are in the eastern part of the state and cover about 121000 square miles» or about one-fourth of the state{figQ l)., This area1' part· of the Appalachian Plateau, has a relief measured in a fev hundred feet P except in the northern part which is a glacial till plain of low relief(/l The rocks forming the platee.u aTe essentially flat, dipping gently eastward at about 35 feet per mile, except where the eastward dip is interrupted by one of a few minor :folds~
Ohio produces about 35 million tons of bituminous coal ~ year and ranks f'ifth among the coal producing stateso A.pproximately one-half' of the production comes from underground mines and the other half comes from open
pit minesQ Of the more than ;o named coal beds in Ohio, only 9 beds that
produce commercial quantities of coal vere sampled for this study~ The rank of the coal is high-volatile bituminous, and the commercial beds are all suitable for industrial use~ <ij'arious types of stokers~ and domestic usee The ash content of the commercial beds~ averaged eotb by bed and field, ranges

..

from ·6 to 12 percent., (Keystone Coal Buyers Manual p 195l;f pp "· 288-290) ·~ The Ohio Geological Survey bas publish~d a number of reports on the
coal-bearing rocks of Ohio (Bownocker and Dean~ l929~ Bownocker , 1947~ Condit; 19121 Morningstar:t 1922 "' Smith, Brant: Amos, and Krumin3 1952, Ohio J.nn:pal • Coal Report and Non-Metallic Mineral Rei>ort~ 1946" and White and Gambs 5 1947) ,,
Also available are topographic maps of the u~ s. Geological Survey which
cover the coal field at a s cale of lg62 ~ 500 and most of which were originally published between 1900 and 19l0e

SCOPE OF THE INVEPTIGATION
The U. S v Geological Survey collected samples and measured the radio'""-' activity of coals and associated rocks in eastern Ohio on behalf of the Division of Raw Materials of the Atomic Energy Commissionc Stewart W.
Welch and John w. Huddle did preliminary sampling in. August 1952, and Stewart
We Welch and John Lc Snider did further field work from September 30 to October 111 1952.
The purpose of this investigation was to search for uranium in impor~ tant coal beds mined in Ohio that l&r>e widely used in .industryo Even if the coal contained only very small amounts of uranium, the ash resulting from · industrial use might contain recoverable amounts of uranium• . The sampling
was chiefly confined to large mines producing coal from the highest quality
coal beds and the· extensively mined beds were sampled at~ mO.:re places than beds that are mined only locally~ Because the average ash content of the coal ranges from 6 to 12 percent , the concentration of uranium in the ash would be on the order of 16 to 8 times .. A uranium content in the ash of as; much as Oc005 percent thus would not be detectable by field measurements of radioactivity o{ the coal,and all radioactivity measurements vTere made in the Washington laboratory of the Geological Surveyo
Forty-six channel samples of nine different coal beds were collected at thirty-six localities ; all samples came from fresh surfaces at the coal face in strip pits or in drift " slope , or shaft mines -. The whole thickness of the coal beds excluding shale and bony coal partings was taken as a single sample ~ except where the coal was in two or more distinct benchesQ Sections of the coal were measured at each sample locality. Two samples of shale~ one of flint clay, and one of cannel coal, also were collected~

8
STRATIGRAPHY
The coal-bearing rocks in Ohio are in the Pennsylvanian and Permian systems o The Pennsylvanian system is subdivided into four series, which are, in ascending order, the Pottsville1 Allegheny, Conemaugh, and Monongahela~ The boundaries of the series are at the top or base of certain widespread coal beds. All connnercially mined coals in Ohio are in the Pennsylvanian system.
All Permian rocks in Ohio are assigned to the Durikard series ~
Pennsylvanian system
The oldest Pennsylvanian series in Ohio is the Pottsville. It has an average thickness of 255 feet and is composed mostly of sandstone and siltstone and subordinatezy of clay, coal1 and marine limestone (Morningstar, 1922, p~ 8) ~ The base of the series is drawn at the unconformable contact with the underzying Maxville limestone member of the Logan formation of Mississippian age and the top is drawn at the base of the Brookville Noo 4 coal ~
The Allegheny series, which contains more coal, siltstone, shale, and marine limestone than the Pottsville, extends from the base of the Brookville No. 4 coal to the top of the Upper Freeport Noo 7 coal and ranges in thickness from 175 to 280 feet (Bownocker ,.and Dean, 1929, Generalized section opposite
page 6).
Overlying the .Allegheny is the Conemaugh series, which extends trom the top of the Upper Freeport No" 7 coal to the base of the Pittsburgh No • 8 coal. The Conemaugh series ranges in thickness from 350 to 475 feet and conBists largely of sandstone and siltstone and a few beds of coal and limestoneo
The youngest series in the Pennsylvanian is the Monongahela, which

9
ranges in thickness from 240 to 270 feet and extends from the base of the
Pittsburgh Noo 8 coal to the top of the Waynesburg No. 11 coal ~ Limestone and red shale are more common in the }~nongahela series than in the older
Pennsylvanian rocks ~ (Bownocker and Dean~ 19299 pQ 179)~
Coal beds
The commercially important coal beds in Ohio are found in the Penn= sylvanian system. Coal beds in the Pottsville series are mined at a few places but are not as important as those in the Allegheny and Monongahela <~ In the Allegheny series the Brookville No" 4~ the Lower Kittanning No " 5:; the Middle Kittanning No ,. 6~ the Lower Freeport No ~ 6A. J and the Upper Freeport No .. 7 are thick and widespread and are commonly minedt The Conemaugh series has only thin and non-persistBnt coal beds .which are not mined extensi~aly ~ The coal beds in the Nonongahela series supply most of the annual coal production in Ohio :. The Pittsburgh No , 8 coal is the Il'.....·st important :. but the Meigs Creek No El 9 coal also is extensively mined-) (Keystone Coal Buyers Manual, 1951, p o 390) •
There are two systems of nomenclature used for commercially :important coal beds in Ohio -, Many miners and operators refer to the coals by number~ J while some use names ~ This report identifies the coalsby both names and numbers .., Table 1 lists the names and numbers of the coal beds and the local = ities at whi~~h they were sampled,,
~~r-mian syst!?!!! .
The Permian system, represented by the Dunkard series in Ohio, is approx= imately 600 feet thick and consists of sandstone ~ shale1 siltstone t limestone 1 coal, and underclay. The base of the system is drawn at the top of the Waynes ~ burg coal and the top is the erosional land surface or unconformable contact

RADIOACTIVITY OF SAMPJLES
The sample localities are shew-n on figure lo Table 2 lists the loca-
tions, coal bed descriptions, and equivalent uranium content of the sampleso Equivalent uranium is the amount of U't"a.niUill that would be present in the sample if all the radioactivity of the sample were dueto uranium in equilibrium with its radioactive disintegration products. The equivalent uranium content of five samples was OcOOl percent or more </) The equivalent uranium content of four of these samples was checked twice by radi.oactivity measurements, and both results are givenc. The percent ash ~ percent uranium in ash, and percent uranium in these four sample s were determined chemically,

CONCLUSIONS:
Only five samples have 0.,001 percent or more equivalent uranium" T\lo of' these are of the shale above the Middle Kittanning No~ 6 coal, which has;
0~003 percent equivalent uranium at localities 6 and 12 ~ A cannel coal above the Brookville Noo 4 coal at locality 32 and a bony coal above the Pittsburgh
Noo 8 coal at locality 35 both have OoOOl percent equivalent urani'UJ!lo The Pittsburgh No& 8 coal has Oo002..0o003 per~cent equivalent uranium at locality 18.,
The chemical analysis of the sample of the Pittsburgh Noo 8 coal from . locality 18 shows OoOOOl percent uranium~ much less than the equivalent
uranium measurement of o~002..,Qo003 percento Three of the other four samples which were chemically analyzed also have a radioactivity greater than the uranium content would explain., Routine equivalent uranium measurements
probably are accurate to ± OoOOl percent~ Consequentlyfi the difference
between such routine measurements and the more accurate chemical analyeis, probably is at least - 0 ~001 percent~ but the discrepancy may be due to error in radioactivity measurement.. The discrepancy between the two results also might be explained by' a lack of equilibrium in the samples or by the presence of potassium as about 1.5 percent of this element can cause a radioactivity of' 0_,001 percent equivalent uranium.,
There are not enough data to draw any conclusions about relation of •
high radioactivity to position in the depositional basin~ post...(iepositional structure1 or stratigraphy"
Of' the 18 important coal beds in Ohio that are mined more or less extensively ~ JJ) were sampled0 The most importan.t producing beds were sampled
at more places than beds that are mined only locally0 The results of sampling
indicate that there are no potential sources of uranium in the ash of the coals

22

that were sampled~ It is possible that other mined coal beds, or thin coal beds having a high ash content, because of wpich they are not extensively mined and were not included in this reconnaissance, contain larger amounts
of uranium ~ The general level of radioactivity indicated b7 the reconnaissance)
however, does not suggest that this is likelyo
