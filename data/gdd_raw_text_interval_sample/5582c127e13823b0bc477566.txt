TEST WELLS, GUBIK AREA, ALASKA

By FLORENCE M. ROBINSON

ABSTRACT
From 1944 to 1953 the U. S. Navy, through its contractor and assisting Government agencies, explored the petroleum possibilities of Naval Petroleum Reserve No. 4 and adjoining areas in northern Alaska. In the course of this exploration, seismic, magnetic, and gravimetric geophysical surveys and field geologic surveys were made, and a test-well drilling program was undertaken.
Two tests were drilled on the Gubik anticline, which is about 180 miles southeast of Point Barrow. The two wells were little more than a mile apart, and the same Upper and Lower Cretaceous rocks were penetrated. Gas was discovered at two horizons: in the Tuluvak tongue of the Prince Creek formation, and in the Chandler and Ninuluk formations undifferentiated. Gubik test well 1 was drilled to 6,000 feet then plugged and abandoned; Gubik test well 2 was drilled to 4,620 feet; it then blew out, caught fire, and was subsequently abandoned.
INTRODUCTION
In the course of the exploration of Naval Petroleum Reserve No. 4, northern Alaska (Robinson, 1956, p. 1-3), two test wells were drilled on the Gubik anticline, 180 miles southeast of Barrow and approximately 16 miles northeast of Umiat near latitude 69°26' N. and longitude 151°28' W. (See fig. 11.) The Gubik anticline extends eastward between the Anaktuvuk and Colville Rivers across the mouth of the Chandler River. The presence of the anticline was reported in 1945 by a reconnaissance geologic field party, and its structural features were later defined by geologic mapping and reflection seismograph work. The name "Gubik" is a variant of the Eskimo word for "Big River," the native name applied to the lower Colville River.
The test wells are on a low gravel terrace 10-12 feet above the normal river level on the west side of the Chandler River a short distance above its mouth. (See pi. 13.) In general, the area near the confluence of the Colville, Chandler, and Anaktuvuk Rivers is one of low rolling hills at the northern edge of the northern foothills of the Brooks Range. Close to its mouth, the

Anaktuvuk River flows through a broad valley with low bluffs. The valley of the Chandler is narrower and has steeper walls, which are 50 to several hundred feet high.
The test wells were drilled into Upper and Lower Cretaceous strata. Gas in commercial quantities was found in two separate sandstone beds 1,500 feet apart stratigraphically. A detailed description of the rocks examined and the logistic, engineering, drilling, and production data are assembled in this paper.
ACKNOWLEDGMENTS
Engineering information presented here is taken largely from the weekly, completion, and final reports made to the U. S. Navy by Arctic Contractors. United Geophysical Co. did most of the geophysical work, and the Schlumberger Well Surveying Corp. recorded all but one of the electric log runs. Gas analyses were made by the U. S. Bureau of Mines at Bartlesville, Okla., and some core analyses were made by Core Laboratories, Inc., of Dallas, Tex. The help of persons connected with these organizations is gratefully acknowledged.
Lithologic descriptions and other core analyses were made by the author in the Fan-banks laboratory of the U. S. Geological Survey. Members of the Geological Survey whose work is included are Harlan R. Bergquist, who identified the microfossils; Ralph W. Imlay, who identified the Lower Cretaceous megafossils, and George Gryc, who identified the Upper Cretaceous megafossils; Robert H. Morris, who established heavy-mineral zones; and Roland W. Brown, who identified plant fossils. The stratigraphic distribution of microfossils in the test wells of northern Alaska will be presented by H. R. Bergquist in another chapter of this series.

Anaktuvuk River in 1945. In 1947 another Geological Survey party found that the anticline plunges west near the Colville River. In 1945 and 1946 an airborne magnetometer survey was made of part of the Reserve and adjoining areas by the Geological Survey in a joint effort with the U. S. Navy. This survey included the area around the Gubik anticline. The Gubik test wells are at the northwestern end of an elongate magnetic high, which parallels the much larger high associated with the Umiat anticline to the southwest.
As a followup of the surface geologic mapping, a seismograph crew in 1950 shot two lines on the west end of the Gubik anticline. East closure was mapped during the same summer by a Survey party, and a detailed seismic survey to completely delineate the Gubik structure was made the following year. No gravity work was done in the Gubik area.
The area of closure on seismic horizon "A," a phantom horizon in the Grandstand formation of Cretaceous age, extends eastward; it is about 12 miles long and has a minimum width of a little over 2% miles. (See pi. 13.) Closure is at least 400 or 500 feet and average dip on the flanks is about 3°. Seismic reflections were good on the flanks of the anticline, but poor on the crest. Below a depth of 4,000 feet, no satisfactory reflections were obtained; apparently most of the section is shale. No seismic evidence of faulting was noted.

PURPOSE OF TESTS
Gubik test well 1 was drilled near the apex of the Gubik anticline to test the oil and gas possibilities between the surface and the bottom of the sands that are productive on the nearby Umiat anticline (Collins, 1958). Gas in commercial quantities was found at a depth of 890 to 1,750 feet in the sandstones of the Tuluvak tongue in the Prince Creek formation (Upper Cretaceous) and at a depth of 3,350-3,700 feet in the sandstones of the Chandler and Ninuluk formations undifferentiated.
The producing strata at Umiat, the upper and lower sandstone beds of the Grandstand formation, apparently become finer grained eastward and in Gubik test well 1 are represented only by siltstone with a few thin beds of sandstone. Surprisingly good cuts were obtained from the silty clays in cores 42-44 and in core 50 of Gubik test well 1, considering the "tight" nature of these rocks.
Gubik test well 2 was drilled on the south flank of the anticline to test for oil in sands which were gas bearing or showed reservoir properties in Gubik test well 1, to determine the extent of the gas deposit in each gas-bearing sand, and to determine the depths of any gas-oil, gas-water, or oil-water contacts that might be penetrated. Both gas and oil shows were found. A discussion of these shows by C. L. Mohr, chief of

exploration, Arctic Contractors, can be found on page 254. Unfortunately, the well blew out and was abandoned before the testing was completed. -
STRATIGRAPHY
The Gubik test wells are about 6,000 feet apart, and there is little difference in the sections penetrated. Each well was drilled through a thin mantle of unconsolidated sufficial sediments into the Schrader Bluff formation of Late Cretaceous age. Below this, the drills penetrated the Tuluvak tongue of the Prince Creek formation, the Seabee formation, the Chandler and Ninuluk formations undifferentiated, the Grandstand formation, and finally the Topagoruk formation of Early Cretaceous age.

QUATERNARY DEPOSITS
ALLUVIUM
The first samples received in the Fairbanks laboratory were from the 75-foot depth of Gubik test well 1 and from the 160-foot depth of Gubik test well 2. From the well geologist's description of test well 1, it is assumed that the top 67 feet in that well represents relatively unconsolidated river deposits of sand, gravel,

and clay of Recent .or possibly of Pleistocene age. Examination of samples received in Fairbanks indicate that the near-surface sands are made up of coarse grains of subangular yellow quartz, white and clear quartz, red chert, dark-gray and black chert, and also rare grains of green chert. The well geologist did not report on the first 160 feet of .Gubik test well 2.
CRETACEOUS BOCKS
COLVILLB GROUP (UPPER CRETACEOUS)
SCHRADER BLUFF FORMATION
The Barrow Trail and Rogers Creek members of the Schrader Bluff formation (Late Cretaceous age) are present in the Gubik wells. The Sentinel Hill member, youngest part of the formation, does not occur here.
The Barrow Trail and Rogers Creek members are similar lithologically except that the former has a larger proportion of sandstone. They are distinguished in outcrops largely by topographic expression, because the sandier Barrow Trail member is more resistant to erosion. The total thickness of the two members in the test wells is 823 feet (Barrow Trail, 228 feet thick, at the top of the section, and Rogers Creek, 595 feet thick, at the bottom).
The Schrader Bluff formation consists primarily of soft medium-light-gray clay shale and a total of about 240 feet of siltstone and sandstone. The sandstone beds are very light to light gray and medium hard, with very fine to fine angular to subangular grains, about 85 percent white and clear quartz. Coal particles, dark chert, some biotite, pyrite, and as much as 10 percent opaque white volcanic glass shards make up the remainder of the grains. The matrix is characteristically bentonitic and argillaceous. This reduces permeability although porosity may be relatively high. Structures in the sandstone suggesting worm or mollusk burrows are relatively common in the cores. The sandstones are noncalcareous.
At 336 feet in Gubik test well 2, there is 3 inches of conglomerate made up of rounded black chert granules and pebbles as much as an inch in diameter. Quartz granules are rare. Also present are pelecypod fragments. The pebbles and shell fragments are in a lightgray bentonitic clay matrix.
Seven inches of medium-gray rather hard argillaceous limestone was found near 384 feet in Gubik test well 1. The limestone breaks parallel to the bedding and contains white crystalline calcite in fractures and veins.
Bentonite and tuff are abundant in the section. The tuff is white, very light gray, greenish gray, and pinkish gray; It is hard and contains particles of carbonaceous material, biotite plates, and rare sand grains. Traces and beds of bentonite are fairly common.

The Schrader Bluff formation has a few microfossils and is probably marginal marine. A thick-shelled

InoceramuSj possibly /. lundbreckensis McLearn, is

present.

PRINCE CREEK FORMATION

The Tuluvak tongue of the Prince Creek formation underlies the Schrader Bluff formation in the Gubik area. It is 870 feet thick and is made up mostly of sandstone with some conglomerate, clay shale, coal beds, and bentonite.
The sandstone is light gray to medium light gray, soft and friable to moderately hard, and thin bedded to massive. Sandstone in the Tuluvak tongue is coarser grained than any of the older sandstones drilled in the Reserve. The grains are subangular to sub-

rounded and range in size from very fine to very coarse, with a preponderance of the coarser material, including granules and pebbles. Generally, the larger sizes are better rounded. Fifty to eighty-five percent of the sand grains is white and clear quartz, and as much as 40 percent of the total is dark-gray and black chert.

The coarser-grained sandstones have the larger proportion of dark chert and consequently have a salt-andpepper appearance in the hand specimen. Biotite,

coal, ironstone, and white feldspar (?) particles, rare yellow quartz (?), pyrite, and rock fragments are the other constituents of the sandstone. The matrix ranges from argillaceous and sideritic to very calcareous.

In a few beds the sandstone grades to siltstone. Rare tiny worm burrows similar to those in the Schrader Bluff formation are in the uppermost 50 feet of these beds. The effective porosity of the sandstone in the Tuluvak ranges from 4.4 to 25.4 percent, averaging about 15 percent, and the permeability, from imper-

meable to 3,780 millidarcys. Gas is present in the Tuluvak tongue.

Conglomeratic layers in the Tuluvak tongue are not common nor very thick. The conglomerate consists of

rounded granules and pebbles of black chert and white quartz in a coarse sand matrix.

Twelve percent of the tongue is clay shale which is medium light gray to medium gray and ranges from soft to hard. Most of the clay shale has good cleavage except in the lower part of the section where some claystone is found. Bentonite is common throughout

in beds as much as 2 feet thick and is also finely disseminated in the clay shale. This bentonite is soft, white, very light gray, light gray, greenish gray, and

bluish gray. The bentonitic shales are softer and of lighter color than the nonbentonitic clay shale. Bentonite is rarely found in the matrix of the sandstones

in contrast to the sandstone in the Schrader Bluff

formation above, but is, in many places, closely associated with coaly or carbonaceous layers. Carbona-

ceouslaminae, partings, and plajnt fragments are common hi both the clay shale and the sandstone. Coal, mostly in thin beds, is also common. It is shiny to dull and black and is rather brittle. Small amounts of clear

yellow amber occur in the coal beds. The clay shale is much darker where associated with carbonaceous

material. Thin hard medium-gray limestone layers are very rare. Calcite and aragonite in tiny veinlets

in the limestone and clay shale were noted. Clay ironstone nodules and lenses are common in the formation. The Tuluvak section is mostly nonmarine as

suggested by the abundance of carbonaceous material,

coal, and plant fossils. However, some pelecypods (including Inoceramus) Foraminifera, and Radiolaria

were found.

SEABEE FORMATION

In the Gubik test wells, 1,545 feet of marine clay shale and a small amount of silty sandstone make up

the Seabee formation. In the subsurface the lithologic break between the Prince Creek and the Seabee formations is placed at the base of the major sandstone group

and above a distinctive microfauna. (See p. 261.) In the type section (Detterman, in Gryc and others, 1956), the Ayiyak member, 360 feet of marine siltstone and

sandstone, is described at the top of the Seabee formation. In the Gubik test wells the upper part of the section assigned to the Seabee formation is also partly sandy and probably represents the Ayiyak member. However, regional correlations in the subsurface suggest

that there may be a small unconformity at the top of the Seabee formation, and because the boundaries of this member cannot be clearly defined lithologically in the subsurface at Gubik, the term "Ayiyak member"

is not used here. The 100 feet or so of sandy beds in the uppermost
part of the Seabee formation contains marine pelecypods

and some microfossils. The sandstone is light to medium light gray, rather hard, and silty to fine grained and shows fair porosity but very low permeability; some has very calcareous cement. The sandstone

contains 80 percent of white and cle^r quartz, and 20 percent of dark chert, rock fragments, coal particles

and mica. The sandstone grades downward into silty

and argillaceous beds. Below this clastic unit is 900 feet of clay shale with
scattered thin beds of siltstone. In the upper third of the Seabee formation the clay shale is medium light gray but becomes medium gray lower in the section; on the whole the shale is darker than the shale of other Upper Cretaceous formations. Slightly silty beds are common. White bentonite and light-colored benton-

itic shale are also found. In certain parts of the 900-foot shaly Seabee forma-
tion, the clay shale is medium dark gray, breaks easily

parallel to the bedding, and characteristically is associated with thin beck and partings of light-colored bentonite, laminae of limestone and aragonite, thinshelled Inoceramus Idbiatusf fragments and prisms, and fishbone fragments. These beds are probably correlative with the dark "paper shales" that crop out in the Umiat area and are lithologically distinctive in the Cretaceous section. The section between 3,040 and 3,100 feet in Gubik test well 2 is a good example of these beds.
Silty clay shale, siltstone, and sandstone make up the lowest 500 feet of the Seabee formation. The lower sandstone beds of this formation are light gray, hard, massive, and very fine to medium grained. The grains are subangular to subround, and 70-95 percent are white and clear quartz. Other constituents are chert, coal particles, rock fragments, and mica. Over a wide area these beds rest unconformably upon the Nanushuk group and closely resemble the sandstone of that group; they may represent reworked material from the older rocks. They can be differentiated from the sandstones of the Nanushuk group by the abundance of biotite plates, rock particles, and generally a very "dirty" matrix. A large part of the sandstone is silty and grades into siltstone. Argillaceous beds are the same as those described above in the 900-foot shaly part of the Seabee. Bentonite and limestone beds and fish fragments are rare. Inoceramus prisms and fragments are common in both the core and cuttings. Mollusklike borings appear in the siltstone. "Swirly" beds present are the result of slump or deformation at the time of deposition. In one core a broken Inoceramus shell is embedded vertically in the distorted beds. The beds are noncalcareous to moderately calcareous, and porosity is fab", but permeability is very low. They are not good reservoir rocks and have very few shows of gas or oil.
NANUSHUK GROUP (LOWER AND UPPER CRETACEOUS)
CHANDLEB AND NINULUK FORMATIONS UNDIFFERENTIATED
Below the Seabee formation is 440 feet designated as the Chandler and Ninuluk formations undifferentiated. The marine Ninuluk formation is the time equivalent of the upper part of the nonmarine Chandler formation (Kobinson, 1956, fig. 3). The upper 60 feet is definitely marine and could be assigned to the Ninuluk formation as both marine megafossils and microfossils typical of the Ninuluk formation were found. However, in the rest of the section the proportion of marine to nonmarine rocks cannot be determined; so the entire 440 feet has not been divided.
The sandstones of the Nanushuk group are similar to those of the Seabee formation above; sandstones of the Nanushuk, however, contain a smaller amount of
429370 58 2

argillaceous material in the matrix and are less calcareous. The grain size is also slightly coarser than that in the Seabee formation. Carbonaceous material

and .clay ironstone are more common. The break between the Colville and Nanushuk groups is picked on the basis of lithologic evidence, as well as on a major change in microfauna and a change in heavy-mineral

zones. The Chandler and Ninuluk section, the lower of the
two gas-producing beds in the Gubik anticline, is 86

percent of sandstone and siltstone and 14 percent of clay shale. The sandstone is light gray to medium light gray, hard, and mostly massive with irregular fracture. The grains range from silt to medium sand and are composed of 75-90 percent of white and clear quartz and varying amounts of dark-colored chert, coaly particles, mica, and rock fragments. Chalky white-weathered chert or feldspar particles, pyrite, and garnet are rare. The matrix is argillaceous and locally calcareous. At 3,603 feet in Gubik test well 1, the carbonate content is 38.3 percent by weight, but

this high percentage is unusual. The effective porosity of the sandstone beds ranges
from 1.6 to 15.1 percent, and the permeability, from impermeable to 265 millidarcys. The sandstone at about 3,500 feet in Gubik test well 1 and at about

3,800 feet in Gubik test well 2 has the best porosity stone and permeability.
The siltstone is similar in composition to the sandstone but is medium light gray and more regularly bedded. Crossbedding, ripple marks, and "swirly" bedding were noted. Carbonaceous partings and very rare thin shiny black coal beds are present. Nodules and laminae of olive-gray and yellowish-gray clay iron-

stone are typical of the section. The clay shale is medium to medium dark gray and
moderately hard, has good cleavage, is finely micaceous, and has micaceous and carbonaceous partings. A small amount of the shale could be called claystone

as it has poor or no cleavage. A foot of hard medium-gray limestone occurs at
3,890 feet in Gubik test well 2. This limestone contains a thin vein of white calcite. The only occurrence of bentonite (very light gray) is in the well cuttings at about 3,655 feet in Gubik test well 1. A 3-inch bed containing abundant white oolites was found in Gubik test well 2 at 3,734 feet. The matrix and some of the oolites are very calcareous; other oolites appear to be composed of weathered chert and still others are coated

with pyrite.

GRANDSTAND FORMATION

The transition from Chandler and Ninuluk formations undifferentiated to the Grandstand formation is gradational. The top of the predominantly marine

212

EXPLOBATION OF NAVAL PETROLEUM RESERVE NO. 4, ALASKA, 1944-53

Grandstand formation is marked approximately by the first appearance of the microfossils and megafossils of the Verneuilinoides borealis faunal zone. . The Grandstand formation is 580 feet thick and composed of clay shale with about 30 percent of siltstone and sandstone. The clay shale is medium to medium dark gray and moderately hard and has fairly good cleavage. A small proportion of it has poor cleavage. It is finely micaceous and has rare micaceous-carbonaceous partings as in the formation above. It is interbedded and gradational with siltstone beds.
The remaining beds are silty clay shale, siltstone, and silty sandstone. The color ranges from light to medium gray, depending on the amount of sand; the more sand the lighter the color. The sand grains range from very fine to fine. Eighty-five percent or more is composed of subangular to subrounded white and clear quartz grains. The sandy, silty beds range from noncalcareous to calcareous. All beds tested were impermeable or had a permeability of less than 1 millidarcy. Effective porosity ranges from 3.9 to 11.1 percent. Good oil cuts were obtained from the more clastic beds. The sandstone of the Grandstand formation can be correlated with the producing beds at Umiat (Collins, 1958), but reservoir conditions, where tested on the Gubik anticline, are much poorer. The sandstones become finer grained northeast from Umiat.
There is a trace of bentonite or bentonitic clay shale in the upper part of the Grandstand formation. Thirty percent of a ditch sample at 4,130 feet in Gubik test well 2 is light-bluish-gray bentonite containing numerous plates of biotite and scattered subangular grains of quartz. Clay ironstone is very rare in the section, and carbonaceous or coaly partings are uncommon.
TOPAGORUK FORMATION
The oldest rocks reached by the Gubik test wells are in the Topagoruk formation. Gubik test well 1 was drilled through 1,685 feet, which was almost entirely clay shale; the bottom of the formation was not reached. Much of the clay shale is silty, but less than 75 feet is siltstone. Sandstone beds are very rare. The contact between the Topagoruk and Grandstand formations is arbitrarily drawn where a much higher percentage of siltstone and sandstone is noticeable. There is no sharp break between the two formations.
The clay shale of the Topagoruk formation is mostly medium to medium dark gray, although lighter gray beds containing bentonite are present. The shale is moderately hard and has fair to excellent cleavage. It is silty and interbedded with numerous thin beds

and partings of medium-light-gray siltstone. The proportion of silt in the clay shale decreases with depth, and in the lowest part of the formation penetrated, silt is essentially absent. The few massive siltstone beds found are medium light gray and resemble those of the Grandstand formation.
White bentonite and bentonitic clay shale are quite common in the upper half of the formation drilled. Traces of coal also occur in this formation. Except for a calcareous matrix in a few silty beds, a trace of aragonite, and a trace of clay ironstone, carbonates are lacking in the Topagoruk formation.
A slight show of oil and gas was obtained from silty beds in this formation in core 50 at 5,441 feet of Gubik test well 1. Megafossils and microfossils of the Verneuilinoides borealis faunal zone are present and the formation is marine in origin.
HEAVY-MINERAL STUDIES
Sixty-two heavy-mineral samples were taken from the two Gubik test wells and were analyzed by R. H. Morris as a part of his study of the heavy minerals of Naval Petroleum Reserve No. 4. He concludes that biotite and hornblende heavy-mineral zones are represented in the holes. The method of preparing samples and a short description of the various heavy-mineral zones (written before the Gubik wells were drilled) may be found in Morris and Lathram (1951). In Gubik well 1 the biotite zone ranges from 360 to 3,280 feet, and the hornblende zone, from 3,340 to 3,600 feet. In Gubik well 2 the biotite zone ranges from 320 to 3,540 feet, and the hornblende zone, from 3,620 to 4,080 feet. The biotite zone coincides with the Colville group, and the hornblende zone, with the upper part of the Nanushuk group. Figure 13 shows the range and abundance of biotite and hornblende and the other heavy minerals which were used to define the zones.
GUBIK TEST WELL 1
Location: Lat 69°26'46" N., long 151°28'06" W. Elevat'ftm: Ground, 144 feet; kelly bushing, 156 feet. Spudded: May 20, 1951. Completed: August 11, 1951, plugged and abandoned. Total depth: 6,000 feet.
Gubik test well 1 was drilled on the west side of the Chandler River (see pi. 14) a little more than a mile above its junction with the Colville River. The latitude and longitude given for this well and for Gubik test well 2 are subject to correction, because detailed topographic surveys had not been made of the area at the time the holes were located.

CORE ANALYSES
Core analyses were run on sandstone cores to determine effective porosity, air permeability, and carbonate content. (See following table.) The Barnes (vacuum) method was used to measure porosity. A permeameter, the general requirements of which are detailed in API Code No. 27, second edition, April 1942, was used to determine the permeability.

One oil-saturation test was made: a sample from core 3 at a depth of 1,096 feet contained a trace of petro-

leum, and 15.7 percent of basal sediment and water by volume. A chloride test with silver nitrate was positive.
FORMATION TESTS
Test 1, 1,438-1,495 feet A. Johnston formation tester was run with a H-inch bean, 57 feet of tailpipe, and a 9%-inch packer set at 1,438 feet. There was no blow in one-half hour. The tester was closed for 15 minutes and then pulled. The fluid rose 100 feet. The pressure chart showed that the retaining valve did not open and was leaking. No test was obtained.
Test 2, 1,438-1,495feet The bean was removed and test 2 was run with the packer, as above. Gas reached the surface in 13 minutes, and there was a fair flow for 17 minutes. The tester was closed 30 minutes. Recovery consisted of 120 feet of drilling fluid, and the closed-ia pressure was 740 psi at 80°F.
Test 3, 1,681-1,738 feet The formation tester was run with 57 feet of tailpipe, two pressure recorders, and a %-inch opening (no bean). The 9%-inch packer was set at 1,681 feet. The valve was opened, and gas came to the surface in a few seconds. The tester was open tor 112 minutes and closed for 25 minutes. One sample of gas was taken for analysis. The gas volume was calculated to be 2,060,000 cubic feet per day. The valve seat leaked, and a reliable buttom-hole pressure was not obtained. The closed-in pressure was 450 psi.
Test 4, 3,435-3,519 feet A tester was run in with a 9%-inch packer, 84 feet of tailpipe, and two pressure recorders. The packer failed to hold at 3,435 feet.
Test 5, 3,440-3,519 feet A tester was run in with a 9%-inch packer and 79 feet of tailpipe. The packer failed to hold at 3,440 feet.
Test 6, 3,488-3,519 feet A 5%-inch packer was set at 3,488 feet with a %6-inch bean, 31 feet of tailpipe, and two pressure recorders on the bottom. The flow rates by critical flow provers were:
K-in. orifice, 2,046,000 cu ft per day at 347 psig and 65°F. %-in. orifice, 2,444,000 cu ft per day at 178 psig and 64.5°F. 1-in. orifice, 2,561,000 cu ft per day at 100 psig and 63°F.
Test 7, 3,491-3,608 feet The tester was run with a 5%-inch packer set at 3,491 feet, 117 feet of tailpipe and two pressure recorders. The packer did not hold.
Test 8, 8,521-8,608 feet A packer was set at 3,521 feet and a tester run with a %-inch bean, 86% feet of tailpipe, and two pressure recorders on the bottom. The gas flow rates were:
K-in. orifice, 388,700 cu ft per day at 271.4 psig and 46.5°F. K-in. orifice, 798,100 cu ft per day at 125 psig and 52.5°F. %-in. orifice, 823,200 cu ft per day at 50 psig and 52°F.

Drill stem tests at 1,681 to 1,738 ft. and 3,488 to 3,519 ft. gave volumes of gas in excess of 2 million cubic feet per day from sands of sufficient thickness, porosity, and areal extent to be considered commercial provided a pipe line and market were to be made available.
LOGISTICS

TRANSPORTATION

Gubik test well 1 was drilled with a rig which was moved from the site of Fish Creek test well 1 (fig. 11). Early in 1951 two thousand tons of equipment was moved by tractor train to Gubik. During drilling operations an airstrip was maintained near the well site, but no heavy hauling was done by air.

HOUSING
Two quonsets, sixteen jamesway huts and six wanigans were used. The quonsets housed the galley and messhall and the warehouse and storeroom. The other buildings were for sleeping quarters, recreation, geologyengineering office, utility, latrine, machine shop, water storage, boiler, and cement and chemical storage and were a few hundred feet southeast of the rig site.

A drilling foreman, a petroleum engineer, and a geologist made up the supervisory personnel. The rig crew consisted of 2 drillers, 2 derrickmen, 6 rotary-equipment helpers, 2 firemen, 2 heavy-dutyequipment mechanics, and an oiler. Other permanent employees were 2 cooks, a kitchen helper, a bull cook, a laborer, a tractor operator, an electrician, and a warehouseman-timekeeper. Rig builders, carpenters, a cementer, a Schlumberger engineer, and a stoveman were brought in from Umiat or Barrow as the occasion demanded.

AND DRELLJOSTG EQUIPMENT
During drilling operations 2 weasels, 1 TD-9 crane (cherrypicker), 1 D8 Caterpillar tractor with dozer blade, and 1 Northwest crane were employed. The major items of drilling equipment used by Arctic Contractors were:
1 122-ft Ideco derrick with racking platform and finger. 1 Emsco type NC-36-4 traveling block. 1 Ideco type CB-200 crown block. 1 Ideal National 50 drawworks with Parkersburg hydro-
matic brake. 3 Caterpillar D-l 3,000 diesel engines. 1 Ideal type D swivel. 1 Ideal FE-17 }fin. rotary table. 1 Ideal C-250 7/1* x 15-in. circulating pump. 1 General Motors quad 6 diesel engine. 1 Gardner-Denver 7^ x 10-in. circulating pump. 1 Marlow, model 445 with 5 hp electric motor cellar pump. 2 Mud tanks, 140-bbl capacity. 1 Kewanee 35 hp boiler. 1 Shaffer blowout preventer.

FUEL., WATER, AND L.UBRICANT CONSUMPTION
The materials used while drilling the test were as follows: 602,900 gallons of water, 63,759 gallons of diesel fuel, 1,322 gallons of 72-octane gasoline, 813 gallons of lubricating oil, 445 gallons of thread lubricant, and 160 pounds of grease.

DRILLING OPERATIONS
RIG FOUNDATION
The derrick and drawworks were mounted on pilings driven into the permafrost. After about 2 months of drilling, the substructure supporting the rotary table sank approximately three-fourth inch due to the weight of the drill column. Steel shims were made, inserted under the points of bearing, and rigidity was restored.
While drilling, some difficulty was experienced in keeping the rotary table alined with the drive chain, causing excessive wear of the latter.

Remarks 890__. Casing set; 890 ft of 11 %-in. 47 lb, grade J-55, range 2,
seamless 8-round thread-coupled casing. Displaced mud with 34 bbl of diesel fuel and 10 bbl salt-water solution followed by a neat slurry of 210 sacks HiEarly cement. Top 43 ft of casing was cemented with 25 sacks of Cal-Seal through 1-in. pipe between muck string and 11 %-m. casing. Cement was displaced through guide shoe and float collar. 5,982_ Main clutch bearing burned out. Shut down 2 days for repairs. 6, 000_ Completed drilling Aug. 7, 1951. Suspended operations Aug. 11, 1951. Completion status: all casing was left in hole. Pumped cement into hole at 3,625, 1,650, 900, 870, and 800 ft. Tested top plug at 800 psi with no measurable drop in pressure in 15 min. The ,well head hook-up was left as follows: 11% in casing about 12 in. above cellar floor; a steel plate welded on top of 11%-in. casing with 2-in. nipple 9 in. long welded on top; capped with a 2-in. Nordstrom plug valve. The hole was left full of thin mud above the plug. One small mishap occurred while the well was being drilled the aircraft-warning light on the crown block shorted and caused a minor fire in the canvas covering of the rig. The maximum outdoor temperature was 79° on July 26th, and the minimum was 22° on May 24th.
DRILL, AND CORE BITS
To the total depth of 6,000 feet, 50 drill bits (three 15-in. and forty-seven 10%-in.) were used to drill 5,135 feet (including 35-ft rathole) and 812 feet was reamed. Fifteen percent (900 ft) of the total depth of the hole was cored, employing 50 core bits. Total recovery was 715.4 feet or 79.6 percent. See graphic log (pi. 15) for further information on drill and core bits.
DRILLING MUD
The Contractor's petroleum engineer (written communication, 1951) states:
A water base mud was used to drill to the total depth. A 75 pound per cubic foot water-Aquagel drilling fluid was mixed initially. The shale formations drilled dispersed sufficiently to maintain the required quantity as drilling progressed. Small amounts of Aquagel were added to maintain desirable wall building properties. Baroid was used to increase mud weight as gas bearing sands were encountered.
Formations drilled contained high percentages of bentonite. The viscosity-increasing characteristics of bentonite required the use of considerable quantities of chemical thinners to keep viscosities at workable values. Anticipated short drilling time indicated the use of dehydrated phosphates for thinning agents and acid pyrophosphate and pyrophosphate were used. Quebracho and Driscose were used to reduce water loss.
No difficulties were encountered on the mud control. The hole drilled clean and at no time was any difficulty experienced in running in or out. Tests show the native clays produce a good filter cake of medium permeability. Gas flow during the tests did not increase appreciably with time indicating no serious mudding off of the permeable formations.

The mud-treating materials used were:

HOLE-DEVIATION RECORD
No hole-deviation check was made above 2,675 feet (see pi. 15), but from that depth to 2,800 feet the deviation was 1° or more. From 2,800 to 3,900 feet the deviation was less than 1° with one notable exception at 3,009 feet where 2°15/ was recorded. From 3,900 to 5,690 feet the deviation was 1° to 2°, and below that depth it was less than 1°.

ELECTRIC LOGGING
The first electric log run (see following table) from 830 feet was made with a Widco (Well Instrument Developing Co.) Logger. This instrument did not provide a long normal curve. The rest of the surveys were made by the Schlumberger Well Surveying Corp.

GUBIK TEST WELL 2
Location: Lat 69°25'10" N., long 151°27'26" W. Elevation: Ground, 151 feet; kelly bushing, 163 feet. Spudded: September 10, 1951. Completed: December 14,1941; junked and abandoned. Total depth: 4,620 feet.
Gubik test well 2 also was drilled on the west bank of the Chandler River 4,469 feet east and 3,458 feet south

The average dip of the beds from the top of the hole to the bottom of the Seabee formation is 6°-7°. In the Chandler and Ninuluk formations undifferentiated the dip is 3°. This lower dip may be only apparent, due to the excessive hole deviation of 4° (see pi. 16) recorded at 3,825 feet. Dip in the Grandstand formation averages 4°, but may be affected by the normal fault described below. Although only 200 feet of the Topagoruk formation was penetrated in Gubik test well 2, the lowest two cores show an increase in dip to 13° similar to that of the Topagoruk formation in Gubik test well 1 .
Excessively high dips are not present in Gubik test well 2. Slickensides were noted at 1,916, 4,252, and 4,415 feet. Approximately 200 feet of section in the middle of the Grandstand formation present in Gubik test well 1 is missing in Gubik test well 2. In Gubik test well 2 the section may have been cut out by a normal fault at 4,270 feet; another possibility is that the missing section represents an unconformity. Regionally, however, there is no evidence for an unconformity within the Grandstand formation.
DESCRIPTION OF CORES AND CUTTINGS
No samples were received from the first 160 feet of the hole. The quality of the well cuttings was good. The following description of the cores and well cuttings was made after the material was dried.

The oil cuts from Gubik test well 2, made after the cores were shipped to the Fairbanks laboratory, were generally similar to those obtained from Gubik test well 1. The best odors and cuts came from the thin siltstone and sandstone beds below the thickest sandstone beds in the Nanushuk group. Carbon tetrachloride was used instead of ether in processing the porosity-permeability plugs and in making cuts because it reduced the fire hazard. The cuts are described in the following table.

One sample sealed in paraffin at the well was tested in the laboratory for oil saturation in a Ruska still, but the results were negative. A sample, from core 105 at 3,883 feet, contained no petroleum and contained 5.74 percent basal sediment and water by volume.
No samples of gas were taken in either of the two tests made on the only sandstone in Gubik test well 2 in which sufficient gas was present to reach the surface.
FORMATION TESTS
Test 1, 1,145-1,201 feet. A Johnston formation tester was run with a 7%-uich open-hole packer set at 1,145 feet with a %-inch bean and two pressure recorders on the bottom. The tester was open 30 minutes with no measurable gas flow. Two hundred feet of uncut drilling fluid was recovered. No bottom-hole pressure was recorded. Bottom-hole temperature was 78°F.
Test 2, 1,808-1,351 feet A tester was run with a 7%-inch open-hole packer set at 1,308 feet, a %6-inch bean, and two pressure recorders on the bottom. The tester was open 33 minutes with no measurable gas flow. The recovery consisted of 175 feet of gas- and water-cut drilling fluid. No bottom-hole pressure was

recorded. The salinity of the recovered fluid was 300 ppm.
Test 8, 1,355-1,402 feet. A tester was run with a 5%-inch open-hole packer set at 1,355 feet and with a %6-inch bean. There was one pressure recorder on the bottom. The tester was open 59 minutes with no measurable gas flow. The recovery consisted of 497 feet of slightly gas-cut water. No bottom-hole pressure was recorded. The salinity of the recovered fluid was 275 ppm.
Test 4, 1,431-1,502 feet. A tester was run with a 5%-inch open-hole packer set at 1,431 feet and a K-inch bean. Two pressure recorders were set on the bottom. The tester was open 58 minutes with no measurable flow of gas. Five hundred feet of uncut water was recovered. The salinity of the recovered fluid was 290 ppm. The bottom-hole pressure recorded was 300 psi.
Test 5, 1,504-1,554 feet. A 7^-inch open-hole packer was set at 1,504 feet with a K-inch bean and two pressure recorders on the bottom. The tester was open 27 minutes with no measurable gas flow. The recovery consisted of 115 feet of uncut drilling fluid. The salinity of the recovered fluid was 300 ppm. The bottom-hole pressure recorded was 500 psi, and the bottom-hole temperature was 75°F.
Test 6, 1,674-1,787 feet. A 7K-inch open-hole packer was set at 1,674 feet with a X-inch bean and two pressure recorders on the bottom. The tester was open 31 minutes and recovered 113 feet of uncut drilling fluid. No bottom-hole pressure was recorded. The salinity of the recovered fluid was 285 ppm, the same as the salinity of the circulated drilling fluid.
Test 7, 1,792-1,841 feet. A 9%-inch open-hole packer was set at 1,792 feet with a K-inch bean and two pressure recorders on the bottom. The tester was open 42 minutes. There was a very strong blow of gas estimated in excess of 8,000,000 cubic feet per day. Frozen connecting lines of the critical flow prover prevented accurate measurement of the volume. The tester was closed 11 minutes, and a bottom-hole pressure of 1,050 psi was recorded with a bottom-hole tem-
perature of 80°F.
Test 8, 1,844-1,885 feet. A 5%-inch open-hole packer was set at 1,844 feet with a K-inch bean and two pressure recorders on the bottom. The tester was open 58 minutes. There was an initial blow of 400 psi behind a 1-inch orifice in a 4-inch critical flow prover. Frozen connecting flow prover lines prevented an accurate gas-volume determination. No bottomhole pressure was recorded. The flowing pressure was
950 psi.
Test 9, 1,876-1,885 .feet. A 5-%inch open-hole packer was set at 1,876 feet with a %-inch bean and two

254

EXPLORATION OF NAVAL PETROLEUM RESERVE NO. 4, ALASKA, 1944-53

pressure recorders on the bottom. The tester was open 69 minutes and there was a weak flow of gas of insufficient volume for a critical flow-prover measurement. The recorded bottom-hole pressure was 825 psi. The recovery consisted of 7 gallons of gas, oil, and water cut mud. This test was made because oil appeared in cores of this segment.
Test 10, 1,928-1,984 feet. A 5%-inch open-hole packer was set at 1,928 feet with a K-inch bean and two pressure recorders on the bottom. The tester was open 110 minutes with no detectable flow of gas. Four hundred feet of gas, oil, and water-cut mud was recovered. The salinity of the circulated mud was 400 ppm. The salinity of the recovered fluid was 2,475 ppm. No bottom-hole pressure was recorded; bottom-hole temperature was 75° F.
Test 11, 2,096-2,146 feet A 5%-inch open-hole packer was set at 2,096 feet with a K-inch bean and two pressure recorders on the bottom. The packer failed to hold.
Test 12, 2,103-2,146 feet A 5%-inch open-hole packer was set at 2,103 feet with a %-inch bean and two pressure recorders on the bottom. The packer failed to hold.
Test 13, 3,496-3,450 feet. A. 7&inch open-hole packer was set at 3,496 feet with a %-inch bean and two pressure recorders on the bottom. The tester was open 60 minutes with no detectable flow of gas.

SIGNIFICANCE OF OIL, AND GAS SHOWS AND TESTS
The following evaluation of the shows and tests of Gubik test well 2 was made by C. L. Mohr, chief of exploration for Arctic Contractors (written communication, 1952):
Gas deposits discovered in 6 sands between 1,066 and 1,875 feet in the Gubik 1 were found to extend down the structural dip to some undetermined points beyond Gubik 2. Assuming that gas extends down the dip to a uniform sea-level elevation on all parts of the anticline in each of these sands, the areal extent of the gas deposits would exceed 7,000 acres A seventh gas sand of "the Tuluvak tongue" in Gubik 1 does not carry gas as far down the structure as well 2, where it is found to be water bearing. An eighth gas sand, at 1,905 feet to 1 945 feet in Gubik 1, becomes impervious and nonproductive somewhere between 1 and 2.
A tight sand, which might yield some gas if further tested,was topped at 3,242 feet in 1 and 3,513 feet in 2.
An important gas sand at 3,460 to 3,615 feet in 1 is water bearing in 2 at 3,781 to 3,903 feet. An untested belt, or zone, of this sand extending from 1 to 2 and covering 4,800 acres of the structure, might yield gas, water, or oil over an extensive area of the anticline; but a third well about halfway down the dip between 1 and 2 would be required to test the fluid content in this belt. The fact that good oil saturation was found within a few hundred feet below this sand in the 2 well is a strong suggestion that this sand might carry an oil deposit between 1 and 2.
The oil saturation found in the 2 well at 4,031 to 4,060 feet, and 4,233 to 4,254 feet, also signifies the possibility that these sands might be better developed and capable of oil production at some

TEST WELLS, GUBIK ABBA, ALASKA

other location on the Gubik anticline. Their stratigraphic position corresponds roughly to that of the Umiat pay sands.
A significant feature of the basal part of the gas sand at 1,810 to 1,880 feet in Gubik 2 is the presence of true oil saturation and some free oil below the highly porous and permeable, gas-bearing part of the sand. If this represents a true gas-oil contact, as seems to be the case, then by drilling somewhat farther down the dip, the highly porous and permeable part of the sand should be found at the level of the oil and should yield prolific oil production.
LOGISTICS
A large working force was used to move the drilling rig about \% miles southeast from Gubik test well 1 to the site of Gubik test well 2. The rig was not unitized, and the season was bad for moving. However, Gubik test well 2 was ready to spud within a month after the completion of 1. One thousand and eight hundred tons of material, hauled by cat train, was used in drilling Gubik test well 2; 200 tons was flown in using the large airstrip at Gubik test well 1. An additional strip for bush planes was constructed near Gubik test well 2.
The camp setup was similar to that of the first well 2 quonset huts, 10 jamesway huts on sled runners, and 6 wanigans were used. The personnel, vehicles, and drilling equipment remained the same.
The following materials were consumed during the drilling of Gubik test well 2: 564,000 gallons of water, 89,821 gallons of diesel fuel, 7,517 gallons of 72-octane gasoline, 960 gallons of lubricating oil, 295 gallons of thread lubricant, and 358 pounds of grease.

DRILLING OPERATIONS
RIG FOUNDATION
The derrick and drawworks were mounted on piling. The remainder of the equipment such as tanks, and pumps were mounted on timbers laid on the river gravel.

gas blow, the well ignited and burned for approximately 4 days, resulting in the destruction of the rig. Hole bridged itself near J,800 ft and was filled with water above the bridge and allowed to freeze. Owing to the circumstances it was impossible to set plugs between the various gas sands above 1,800 ft; therefore, there is nothing but a bridge of sand or cavings to prevent the movement of high-pressure gas from the 1,800-ft sand upward to any of the various shallower permeable sands beginning at 1,134 ft. Completion status: at the cellar floor there are an 11%-in. landing base, 11%-in. landing spool, 12-in. series 900, 10%-in. to 3-in. sewage, and 3-in. Hamer plug valve, 6,000-lb test.
BLOWOUT
After the first cement plug was placed at 2,260 feet, a second plug of 40 sacks was placed at 2,251 feet. After the second plug was in place, the drill pipe was pulled above the estimated top of the cement, and the circulation system was run for about 3 hours to clean up the mud. While pulling pipe to change bit, preparatory to running in to feel for top of plug, mud started to blow out when all but three stands were out of the hole. Efforts to close rams around drill pipe failed as mud and gas were blowing out at such a rate that it was impossible to see results. After the well sanded up it was found that the drill pipe had been lifted enough to free the slips and had dropped down the hole. The well blew wild and ignited in about 5 minutes. In only 3 or 4 minutes the rig collapsed. The well sanded up in a few hours, but enough gas from an upper sand was escaping from the casing to flame about 4-6 feet high.
Two days after the original blowout, the well again blew out with volume and force about the same as the first time, but it again sanded up within a few hours and continued to burn with a flame about 4 or 5 feet high. Wreckage was cut away with a torch before extinguishing the blaze, in order to remove the Shaffer gates which were still usable. After the blaze was extinguished with carbon dioxide, the hole was filled with water. The 204 barrels of water required to fill the hole indicated that the top of the bridge was approximately at 1,800 feet.
The only zone in this well which showed by formation test to have high-pressure, large volume gas was between 1,810 and 1,858 feet. This zone was also the only one on the electric log about which there could be no question of the content being oil or gas. The long normal and lateral resistivities were a great deal higher than the short normal.
The volume of fluid required to fill up the hole after it had bridged over following the blowout was the amount required to fill it from 1,802 feet to the surface.
There can be little doubt that the gas blowout came from the sand between 1,810 feet and 1,858 feet.

DRILL AND CORE BITS
A total of 1,445 feet was cored (see pi. 16) using 68 bits, with 82.1 percent core recovery. Thirty-five drill bits were used, three 15-inch bits, thirty-one 10%-inch bits, and one 7%-inch bit, with an average of 90.5 feet drilled per bit.
DRILLING MUD
Arctic Contractor's petroleum engineer (written communication 1952) states that
A water-base mud was used to drill to total depth. A 75 poundper-cubic-foot water-Aquagel drilling fluid was mixed initially; Baroid was used as the mud-weighting agent. Sodium tannate was used to maintain viscosity at a desirable value; sodium bicarbonate to combat cement contamination; and carboxymethyl cellulose to control water loss and stabilize the drilling fluid.
A total drilling time of 86 days was required to complete the well. This treatment maintained an excellent drilling fluid throughout the period. The mud and tanks were cleaned while the well was standing cemented at 810 ft, and only the mud remaining in the tanks at this time was dumped.
In treating the mud, 945 sacks of Baroid, 118 sacks of Aquagel, 1,510 pounds of quebracho, 190 pounds of sodium bicarbonate, 430 pounds of Driscose, and 150 pounds of tetrasodium pyrophosphate were used. Following table shows the approximate amounts used, by depth.

MICROPALEONTOLOGIC STUDY OF THE GUBIK TEST WELLS, NORTHERN ALASKA
By HARLAN R. BERGQUIST

Beneath thin surficial deposits of Pleistocene age, a sequence of about 3,300-3,500 feet of beds of the Colville group of Late Cretaceous age was penetrated in the two test wells drilled on the Gubik anticline. Underlying these beds are approximately 2,700 feet of sedimentary rocks of the Nanushuk group of Early Cretaceous age penetrated in test well 1 and a little more than 1,000 feet of beds of the same group hi test well 2. Foraminifera and some Radiolaria occur at intervals throughout the Colville group in both wells, but were abundant hi only a few samples. Foraminifera are more common hi the Nanushuk group but are poorly preserved. Many of the species of Foraminifera are new and have been recently described by Mrs. Helen Tappan Loeblich (Tappan, 1951, 1957). Others have been identified as species described from beds of Cenomanian and Turonian age in western Canada by C. R. Stelck and J. H. Wall (1954, 1955) and A. W. Nauss (1947, p. 329-434).
Both Gubik test well 1 and Gubik test well 2 started in the Schrader Bluff formation of Senonian age, as determined from certain diagnostic species of Foraminifera. Three of these are Anomalinoides pinguis (Jennings), Nonionella austinana Cushman, and Praebulimina venusae (Nauss). The first two species are known in beds of Austin to Navarre age hi Texas and the last-mentioned was described from the Belly River formation in Alberta. A few other Foraminifera and Radiolaria found in the Schrader Bluff formation are species that range throughout the Colville group.
Below the Schrader Bluff formation and above the Seabee formation is a section which in test well 1 is composed of 870 feet of nonfossiliferous beds and in test well 2 of 885 feet of beds that are largely nonfossiliferous, but interbedded with them are some thin beds containing Foramimfera and Radiolaria. These beds are apparently part of the Tuluvak tongue of the nonmarine Prince Creek formation.
Strata identified as the Seabee formation of Turonian age are about the same thickness (1,545 and 1,575 ft) hi the two wells yet they are quite dissimilar in fossil content. In test well 1 the cores were barren, and only Inoceramus prisms were found. Specimens of Haplophragmoides rota Nauss were common hi two ditch

samples. In test well 2, specimens of Pseudoclaiwlina hastata (Cushman) and Arenobvlimina torula Tappan at the top of the section identify these beds as the upper part of the Seabee formation. Associated species are Haplophragmoides rota and Praebulimina seabeensis Tappan. Some other species of Foraminifera and a few species of Radiolaria were found in core and ditch samples, but these are species that range throughout the Colville group, and none are diagnostic of the Seabee formation.
In the Gubik wells an abrupt change hi microfossils to a thin zone of Gaudryina canadensis Cushman and Trochammina rutherfordi Stelck and Wall indicates the change from the Seabee formation to the Ninuluk formation of the Nanushuk group. These species are known to be characteristic of the Ninuluk formation in other areas. Furthermore, since T. rutherfordi is described from Cenomanian beds in the lower part of the Kaskapau formation in western Canada, its relative abundance in the Ninuluk formation supports the Cenomanian age ascribed to it.
A distinctive faunal zone of Albian age underlies the Cenomanian strata. This is the VerneuUinoides borealis faunal zone, so named from the distinctive fossil that is abundant within it. In some areas the associated Foramimfera number a great many species, and some are the same as species known in Albian beds hi Europe. In the Gubik wells, however, the species are limited to 3 or 4 in the upper part of the zone and a half dozen or so species hi the lower part of the faunal zone. Approximately 2,265 feet of beds of the VerneuUinoides borealis zone was penetrated hi test well 1, but the zone is poorly developed in the lower few hundred feet of the section. Specimens of Ammobacidites fragmentarius Cushman and Trochammina umiatensis Tappan found in test well 2 are the same as those found in the Umiat area.

species of Radiolaria were common in a sample from 525-535 feet, and a few Radiolaria occurred in samples from 815-885 feet. Two or three species of Foraminifera were found in the lower beds. In the core from 731-741 feet, VerneuilinoidesJischeri Tappan was abundant, and Trochammina diagonsisf (Carsey) was common. A few tests of Nonionella austinana Cushman and Praebulimina venusae (Nauss) occurred in ditch samples.
TULUVAK TONGUE OF THE PRINCE CREEK FORMATION (890-1,760 FEET)
The cores were unfossiliferous except for Inoceramus prisms found in three. Scattered Foraminifera and a few Radiolaria were found in some ditch samples. None of the fossils were diagnostic, for the species range throughout the Colville group of sedimentary rocks.
SEABEE FORMATION a»76O-3,305 FEET)
Most of the cores were barren except for Inoceramus prisms. The only ditch samples having any degree of abundance of Foraminifera were from 1,910-2,000 feet; Haplophragmoides rota Nauss was common in two samples.
NESTJLUK FORMATION AND KILLTK TONGUE OF THE CHANDLER FORMATION (3,305-3,735 FEET)
Fossils were found in only 1 sample, a core from 3,342-3,352 feet, in which were 4 species of Foraminifera and 1 species of Radiolaria; Saccammina sp. and Gaudryina canadensis Cushman were common.

Haplophragmoides topagorukensis Tappan was very abundant in a core from 4,352-4,372 feet. This species and specimens of Trochammina rutherfordi Stelck and Wall were common in a ditch sample from 4,410-4,415 feet. T. rutherfordi was also the most frequently occurring species in many of the ditch samples, but there were very few specimens in each one. A core from 5,1005,115 feet had common specimens of Haplophragmoides topagorukensis and Verneuilinoides borealis and 1 or more specimens each of 10 other species; 8 specimens of Gaudryinella irregularis Tappan were foremost of this secondary group.
Only a few Foraminifera, generally V. borealis and T. rutherfordi, occurred in most of the samples throughout the underlying beds from 5,115 feet to the bottom of the hole. Very few specimens were found in the lower cores. Haplophragmoides topagorukensis was common, and V. borealis very abundant in a ditch sample from 5,270-5,280 feet, and T. rutherfordi was very abundant in a sample from 5,510-5,520 feet. Of the few calcareous Foraminifera, Nanushukella umiatensis Tappan and Globorotalites alaskensis Tappan each occurred in five samples. A core sample from 5,7585,768 feet had common specimens of Theocampef sp. and a few other specimens of Radiolaria, but only four specimens of Foraminifera were found in it. In a bottom core a few specimens of T. rutherfordi and Nanushukella umiatensis were identified, and a few others were questionably referred to three species.

Specimens of the Verneuilinoides borealis fauna were relatively abundant throughout much of the interval from 3,805-4,100 feet. Verneuilinoides borealis Tappan, the species for which the fauna is named, occurred most frequently and was common in several samples. A core from 3,900-3,920 feet was very fossiliferous, having common to abundant specimens of V. borealis, Saccammina sp., Miliammina ischnia Tappan, Trochammina rutherfordi Stelck and Wall, Trochammina umiatensis Tappan, Reophax sp., Valvulineria loetterlei Tappan, and Zonodiscus sp., plus a few specimens of a half dozen other species. The fauna is sparse in samples from 4,100-4,190 feet, and the lower beds are barren except for 2 or 3 occurrences of Inoceramus prisms in ditch samples and a fragment of Ditrupa sp.1 in a core from 4,295-4,305 feet.
Occurrences of Foraminifera below 4,000 feet were scattered through beds to a depth of 5,100 feet, and in only 2 or 3 samples were specimens of 1 species common.
' Curved tubular shells from the Cretaceous beds of northern Alaska were formerly referred to Laevidentalium sp. or Dentalium sp. Determinations by Ralph W. Imlay show that these shells are not scaphopods but are worm tubes of the genus Dttrupa.

GUBIK TEST WELL 2
SCHRADER BLUFF FORMATION (160-1,135 FEET)
No microfossil samples were received for the upper 160 feet of section. Scattered Inoceramus prisms, a few specimens of Haplophragmoides rota and Verneuilinoides jischeri, and a very few specimens of Anomalinoides pinguis (Jennings) constitute the fauna found in the upper 700 feet of section in this well. In the lower beds of the Schrader Bluff formation, V. Jischeri was found in several samples and was common in a core from 810820 feet. Tests of Nonionella austinana Cushman and Praebulimina venusae (Nauss) occurred in samples below 720 feet. Radiolaria were common in several samples. In a sample from 780 feet, Cenosphaera sp. and Spongodiscus sp. were common; in samples from 1,000 feet through 1,060 feet, the same species were common, plus a few other Radiolaria.
TULUVAK TONGUE OF THE PRINCE CREEK FORMATION (1,135-2,010 FEET)
Most of the cores were unfossiliferous, but in some of the continuously cored intervals rare occurrences of fossils are conspicuous. The fauna of the Tuluvak is slightly different from that of the overlying Schrade

Bluff formation. Specimens of Trochammina ribstonensis Wickenden and Gaudryina irenensis Stelck and Wall were scattered through samples from the section. Both of these species and Verneuilinoides fischeri Tappan were common in a core from 1,340-1,351 feet. In a core sample from 1,482-1,502 feet, T. ribstonensis was common to abundant. A few Foraminifera of the same species occurred in a core from 1,5781,580 feet. In a core-from 1,731-1,737 feet, Saccammina sp. and Trochammina, whittingtoni? Tappan were both common. The continuously cored section from 1,813 feet through 1,984 feet was unfossiliferous except for some plant imprints at 1,915 feet.
SEABEE FORMATION (2,010-3,585 FEET)
In the upper part of the Seabee formation from 2,129 feet to 2,218 feet is a conspicuous fauna in which Haplophragmoides rota is abundant and Pseudoclavulina hastata (Cushman) and Arenobulimina torula Tappan occur. Because regional studies seemingly indicate that these two species are limited to the upper part of the Seabee formation, I have designated that part of the section as the Pseudoclavulina-Arenobulimina faunal zone. A few specimens of Praebulimina seabeensis Tappan and a few Radiolaria were associated with the fauna in this well. In one sample (2,180-2,190 feet) Zonodiscus sp. was common.
Throughout most of the rest of the Seabee formation below the Pseudoclavulina-Arenobulimina zone, species of Foraminifera and Radiolaria are rare, and only a few specimens were found exceptions to this follow. A ditch sample from 3,030-3,040 feet in which there were no Foraminifera but Spongurus sp. was common. A core sample from 3,100-3,110 feet had common specimens of Gaudryina irenensis? and an abundance of Trochammina diagonisf. Zonodiscus sp. was common in a ditch sample from 3,150-3,155 feet, and Inoceramus prisms were found in several core and ditch samples low in the section. In a core sample from 3,3683,380 feet, Gumbelitria cretacea albertensis Stelck and Wall was common.

FORMATION AND KILLIK TONGUE OF THE CHANDLER FORMATION UNDIFFERENTIATED (3,585-4,025 FEET)
The section was unfossiliferous excepting a core sample near the top from 3,620-3,630 feet, which had common specimens of Saccammina sp. and Trochammina rutherfordi, abundant specimens of Gaudryina canadensis, and a few specimens of Mttiammina ischnia and Zonodiscus sp.
VERNT3UILINOIDES BOREALIS FAUNAL ZONE (4,025 FEET TO TOTAL DEPTH)
The top of the Verneuilinoides borealis fauna occurs in a sample from 4,025-4,030 feet. Only a few Foraminifera were present in the sample, but in a core sample from 4,060-4,075 feet, Haplophragmoides topagorukensis Tappan was common. Ditrupa sp. occurred in a core from 4,058-4,060 feet. Verneuilinoides borealis was common in a sample from 4,150 feet, and a few specimens of Ammobaculites fragmentarius Cushman were found in a sample from 4,210 feet. Specimens of Trochammina umiatensis were common in samples from 4,180, 4,210, and 4,225-4,230 feet. Few Foraminifera occurred in the samples from lower beds in the test well, and several of the cores were barren.
