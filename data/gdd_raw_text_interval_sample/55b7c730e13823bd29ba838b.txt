LETTER OF TRANSMITTAL.

DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR;

U. S. GEOLOGICAL SURVEY,

v APPALACHIAN DIVISION,

Morgantoicn, W. Va., July 15, 1890.

SIR: I have the honor to transmit herewith the results of my study

of the stratigraphy of the bituminous coal rocks in the northern half

of the Appalachian field.

As stated in the body of this report, it can not be expected that this

first attempt to correlate the different beds of coal, limestone, and sand-

stone over such a wide area will be free from error, but it represents

iny best efforts to harmonize the strata of the several regions. No

one knows better than I that many of the identifications suggested are

largely preliminary, and I not only expect but request the friendly

criticism of my brother geologists, knowing that all will be pleased

when the correct order of these interesting deposits shall be finally

determined.

Many questions of great geological interest have not been discussed

in this report, for the reason that I thought it best to postpone their

treatment until some one should have done for the southern half of the

Appalachian coal field what I have attempted for the northern half,

since the field is a unit from Pennsylvania to Alabama, and in the dis-

cussion should be treated as such.

It is hardly necessary to say that the accompanying map is not pre-

sented with any claim for accuracy as to details, but only to show in a

rough way the general distribution of the different members, and with

the hope that it may prove of some service in the preparation of a cor-

rect map of these several series when the Survey shall have extended

'ts topographic work over the entire region.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

Hon. J. W. POWELL,

STRATIGRAPHY OF THE BITUMINOUS COAL FIELD IN PENNSYLVANIA, OHIO, AND WEST VIRGINIA.
BY I. (J. WHITE.

CH A PTEK I.

AREA, STRUCTURE, AND CLASSIFICATION.

The Appalachian Basin contains the largest continuous coal field of

any Carboniferous area. P>eginniiig near the northern line of Pennsyl-

vania, latitude 4l'°, longitude 77°, it extends south westward through

West Virginia, southeastern Ohio, eastern Kentucky, and central Ten-

nessee, ending in western Alabama, latitude ,'53°, longitude 88°, 900

miles from its northern terminus.

The shape of the field has been compared to that of a rude canoe,

tlu1 pointed ends being in Pennsylvania and Alabama, respectively, while

the broadest portion lies in southern West Virginia and Ohio.

As is well known, the general structure of the field is that of a great

trough or basin, the line of greatest depth leaving Pennsylvania near

its southwest corner, and rmssing down through West Virginia rudely

parallel to the Ohio River, to enter Kentucky 10 miles above the month

of the Uig Sandy Kiver. This general trough or geo-syncline is itself

traversed, especially in its northeastern portion, by a series of flexures,

which, although so gentle along the region west of the center of the

field as to be recognizable, with difficulty, yet eastward thereof they

increase in amplitude until the great folds of the Alleghauy Mountains

become a part of the system.

The map sections shown on Pis. X and XI, crossing the Appalachian

field nearly normal to the strike, will give the reader a good idea of the

structttre of the northern half of this field at the localities indicated on

the map (PI. I), and they also show how the folds which are so promi-

nent at the northeast gradually die out toward the southwest, so that

in the region of the (treat Kanawha lliver they almost disappear. This

flattening out of the flexures in southern West Virginia has been

ascribed by Professors Foutaine and Stevenson to the development of

the great system of faults along the southeastern margin of the coal field

in the edge of Virginia., which relieved the tension cm the rocks over

the adjoining portion of the Appalachian field and thus prevented their folding as in Pennsylvania and northern West Virginia. These anticlinal and synclinal folds so well developed at the north are nearly parallel to the Alleghany Mountains, but as they begin to die away in central West Virginia a large anticline (the Volcano) runs nearly north aud south diagonally across the general strike of the beds.
There are probably other folds in the southwestern part of West Virginia, which, like the Volcano anticline, run contrary to the usual direction, but they have not been traced out with sufficient care to warrant description.
The distribution of the different geological groups on the accompanying map will serve to show the general position and direction of the principal anticlines, but the topographic base of the map is so inaccurate that it was thought best not to attempt to put in the anticlinal lines of the region described till the Survey should have completed the regular topographical map.
In this connection it should be stated that this map is not presented with any claims for accuracy in detail, but simply to show the general distribution of the Carboniferous system.
The portion of the Appalachian region herein described includes only the bituminous coal fields of Pennsylvania, Ohio, and West Virginia.
The Pennsylvania and Virginia geologists, led by the two illustrious Rogers brothers, long ago discovered that the main coal-bearing portion of the Carboniferous system could be naturally subdivided into live series. This generalization was founded upon a careful study of the rocks over a wide area, and the subsequent work of other geologists has fully established its general truthfulness to nature as well as its great usefulness in stratigraphic geology.
The more detailed and minute studies of recent years, rendered possible by vast mining developments, have only modified the Rogers classification, and hence it has become so thoroughly ingrafted into geological nomenclature and so familiar to the minds of practical coal operators that it would be very unwise to make any radical changes in it. It is true that in minor details the original nomenclature for some of these series was misleading, but this does not materially affect the grand truths expressed in the general framework of the classification, and hence it has been deemed best to modify and supplement this timehonored work, rather than to destroy it and cast it away, as has recently been suggested by some geologists.
The classification adopted in this report attempts to preserve whatever of the old nomenclature has been found useful aud helpful to geologists, while at the same time such new features are introduced as seem necessary from our wider aud more intimate kuowledge of these rocks.
The entire Carboniferous system of the Appalachian region subdivides naturally into three grand divisions founded upon conditions of accu-

Pocono Sandstone, Vespertlue, No. X, "Big Injun "' oil sand, etc.

As will be seen from the foregoing diagram, the lino between the Middle and Upper Carboniferous deposits passes directly through the center of the Elk Iliver series. This is due to the fact that marine conditions ceased, never to return, with the deposition of the (Jrinoidal limestone and its associated beds, midway in the Barren Measu es, thus separating them into two divisions which are of almost equal thickness, the lower one abounding in marine life, while the upper has nothing but fresh or brackish water forms. The change in this respect is great
enough to warrant the separation of the Barrens into two series, but as the lithologiuul differences at the line of separation are very meager, it is deemed best to keep these rocks a unit as in the Rogers nomenclature.
This report deals only with the Middle and Upper Carboniferous of the above table, and the live series into which they are subdivided will now be described in detail, beginning with the highest.
The discussion of many interesting questions connected with Carboniferous geology is necessarily postponed until the rest or southern half of the Appalachian coal field has beeu carefully studied as a whole.

C IT APT K 11 II.
THE PERMO-CARBON1FEROUS OR DUNKARD CREEK SERIES.
THICKNESS, (JJIAUAC1TEU, AND EXTENT.
The rocks of this series (Upper Barren Measures, No. XVI) begin with the roof shales of the Waynesbnrg coal and extend upward to the topmost beds of the Appalachian region.
How many feet of deposits erosion has removed above the highest remaining beds we can only conjecture. However, if the soft and easily yielding character of the rocks which have escaped disintegration can be taken as a criterion for those that have wasted away, the thickness of the latter must be reckoned by the thousand aud probably by the 10,000 feet.
Several independent measurements from the highest accessible summits foot up a little more than 1,150 feet for the thickness of the series and it is certain that uo other localities could exceed this by more than 100 feet.
The uppermost beds are found at the headwaters of Dunkard Creek, a large stream which heads near the West Virginia-Pennsylvania Hue, on the eastern slope of the watershed separating the Ohio and Monougahela Hirer drainage system, and flowing eastward puts into the Monongahela two miles above Greensboro, Greene County, Pennsylvania, and four miles north from the West Virginia line. This stream flows over Permo-Carboniferous rocks from its source to the point at which it leaves the West Virginia line at Mount Morris, Pennsylvania,a distance of more than thirty miles, furnishing very fine exposures of these rocks along its banks and binds ; hence the geographical uuuie (Dnnkard Creek) which I have given the scries.
These deposits occupy a rather limited area in the Appalachian field, being found in only two counties (Greene and Washington) of Pennsylvania, will; the exception of small isolated patches in Fayette, Westmoreland, and Allegheny. In Ohio there is a larger area of them bordering the Ohio River through the counties of Belmont, Mouroe, Washington, Athens, Meigs, and Gallin. But it is iu West Virginia that we find the principal belt of these beds, for there they cover a wide

region .bordering the Ohio River between the Pennsylvania line at the north and the Great Kanawha Kiver oil tue south, as the accompanying map shows.
The character of the rocks varies greatly in different portions of this area. At the northeastern end of the field, in Washington County, Pennsylvania, limestones seem to predominate in thickness over the gray shales, sandstones, and thin coal beds with which they are there iuterstratitied. But south westward the limestones and coals gradually disappear, so that in Jackson County, West Virginia, no regular coal beds are found, and only one limestone (the Nineveh) remains. The limestones continue in considerable number in Greeno, Ohio, Marshall, and Monongalia Counties, and the northern part of Wetzel County, but southward from this line they rapidly disappear, with tbe single exception noted. The coal beds all die out with the disappearance of the limestones, except one ( the Washington), which seems to extend beyond the Little Kanawha Kiver before it passes out of the series.
As the limestones and thin coal beds gradually fade out to the southwest, red shale, a variety of rock almost unknown in Washington County, Pennsylvania, gradually comes into the section in thin beds at first, but finally extends throughout the whole series, and forms nearly one-half its thickness, thus making a broad baud of red soil from the Pennsylvania line southwestward to the Great Kanawha Kiver.
This increase in red shale beds is accompanied by an increase in the number and massiveness of the sandstone rocks, so that the topography gradually becomes greatly different from that found in Washington County, Pennsylvania. There the surface is gently rolling, the valleys broad, and the hills rounded, with no deep gorges or precipitous slopes, the abundance of limestone rendering the soil so highly fertile that the region has loug been famed as one of the finest grazing and agricultural districts in the Union. But toward the southwest, while the soil remains very fertile, owing to a large quantity of marly material in the red shales, yet the thickening up of the sandstone beds makes the valleys narrow and the tower portion of the hills often precipitous, the arable land being confined largely to the ridges, so that the soil is better adapted to grazing than tillage. In many cases the massive sandstones crop out along the ridges which they have protected from erosion, forming narrow " hogbacks," from which the surface falls away rapidly on each side. Another peculiarity of these beds is that the sand rocks contain no pebbles except near the base of the series, since above the Waynesburg sandstone no pebbles larger than coarse sand grains have ever been seen by the writer in all of the 1,000 feet of deposits, except at a single locality on the Parkersburg and Staunton turnpike, along the dividing ridge between Kitchie and Giliner Counties, West Virginia, where locally the Marietta Sandstones^ 140 feet above the Washington coal, thicken up into a very coarse conglomerate, filled with quartz pebbles.

same interval 15 miles to the northeast, I have regarded the lower bed as the Pittsburgh in constructing the above section. If, however, the coal
100 feet higher should prove to be the Pittsburgh, then the 5-foot coal 150 feet above the bottom of the section would probably be the Waynesburg bed, and the Dunkard Creek series should be cut off just above it, and thus shortened by 155 feet at this locality.
In the vicinity of Belltou, Marshall Comity, West Virginia, 4 miles west from Hoard Tree Tunnel, the exposures are very fine and the surface outcrops can there also be combined with the record of an oil boring, which thus gives another measurement of the entire series.

This boring did not reach the Pittsburgh coal, and hence the identification of the G-foot coal bed, 142 feet above the base of the section, is
made on the same basis as that of the 5-foot bed 150 feet above the bottom of Section 4, since the two coals are evidently identical. The thin coals in the upper half of the series have been named the liellton group from this locality.

In passing sonthwestward from this area of maximum development of the Permo-Carboniferous rocks a considerable change takes place in the character of tin' beds.

The very highest beds of the Dunkard Creek series known to the writer occur in Shoiigh's Knob, at the head of Dunkard Creek, Gilmore Township, Greene County, Pennsylvania, but these are concealed by a thick covering of soil, and hence could not be seen in detail. The highest rock of the series which has been traced over any considerable area is the Windy Gap Limestone.

The stratum is usually of a bluish gray color, quite pure, and has a thickness of about five feet. It contains minute fresh water fossils, and occasionally small crystals of blende.
The only land geologically and topographically high enough to catch this stratum is that which clusters about the southwestern corner of Pennsylvania, iu Greene County, and the adjoining regions of Marshall, Wetzel, and Monongalia, iu West Virginia. Only one point (Iliinsucker's Knob) iu the last county is high enough to catcli this limestone, since its outcrop ranges between 1,500 and l,(iOO feet above the sea. The sections (Figs. 3 and 4) at Board Tree and Belltou, iu Marshall County, as well as the one (Fig. L') iu Aleppo Township, Greene County, show this stratum near their summits, but its horizon is concealed iu Shough's Knob of the Duukard Creek section (Fig. ]).
This is the same stratum as that numbered Limestone XIV by Prof. John J. Steveusou iu his Keport K, Secoud Geological Survey of Penusylvauia.
THE WINDY GAI- COAL.
At an interval of 25 to 30 feet below the limestone just described there occurs a small coal bed just under the summit of the "divide/' at Windy Gap, Greene County, Pennsylvania, and it has been designated from that locality. No opening into it has ever been made, and hence it is known only as a blossom which exposes one to two feet of coal ami black slate, the latter filled with the fossil Cypris, or a closely allied form.
The same bed was also seen in Aleppo Township, and in the summit of the hills at Hellton. It is the highest known coal of the series, and
comes about 1,050 feet above the Wayuesbiirg bed.

THK GILMOKK SANDSTONE.
Crowning the upper portion of the Permo-Carboniferous beds over a considerable area around the heads of Dunkard, Wheeling, and Fish Creeks, there occurs a very massive sandstone having a thickness of 155 to 40 feet. It was named the Gilmore sandstone by Professor Stevenson, from its occurrence iu the township of that name in southwestern Greene County. This stratum is usually a coarse and very massive sandstone, excellent for building purposes, and often forming long lines Of clilT's on the summits of the high ridges. These cliff's are always traversed with fissures, and they furnish a convenient retreat for foxes when chased by hounds, so that the stratum in question is often locally known as the " Fox rocks," and again it is named from the farms where the cliffs occur, as " Pethtle" rocks, " Efaw " rocks, etc. This stratum has been the main agency in preserving all of the very high beds of the Peruio-Carboniferous from erosion.
The interval below the Gilmore sandstone for L'OO to 250 feet consists of red shales, occasional thiu limestones, and gray saudstoues, but con-

llf

32 THE NORTHERN BITUMINOUS COAL FIELD.

(BULL. 96.

tains no beds sufficiently characterized to be identifiable over any considerable area.
THB NINEVEH SANDSTONE.
At 225 to 250 feet below the Gilmore sandstone, we come to another ' great sandstone deposit which, from its good development near the vil- j lage of Nineveh, Greene County, Pennsylvania, has been designated from that locality. Like the Gilinore sandstone above, it is usually an excellent building stone, and has long been used for that purpose on the Baltimore and Ohio Kailroad, near Littleton, Wet /-el County, West Virginia, where it crops out in a great cliff along the hills 150 to 200 feet above creek level.
This same stratum may also be seen in the hills two miles above Jol- I lytown, Greene County, where it has long been quarried on the land I of Thomas White for building purposes. It is of a yellowisli gray cast, rather coarse-grained, but soft, and splits readily into rectangular blocks.
THE BELLTON COAL GROUP.
At 275 to .300 feet under the Gilinore sandstone we find the uppermost of a series of thin coals which, from their tine exposure at the village of Bellton, Marshall County, West Virginia, have been termed the Bellton group. These coals, few of which are rarely more than one foot thick, occur within a rock interval of 200 to 300 feet, and when all are present, as in the Bellton section (Fig. 5), there are five distinct beds, though not all of them are persistent over any considerable area. The three beds given in the Dunkard Creek section (Fig. 1), viz, the Nineveh, Dunkard, and Jolly town, coals, are the most important members of the group. Interstratified with these coals are shales, sandstones, and two important limestones.

THE NINEVEH COAL.
V
This is the uppermost member of the Bellton group, and was named from the village of Nineveh, Greene County, Pennsylvania, by Professor Stevenson.
The coal rarely exceeds one foot in thickness, yet it is generally quite pure, and is frequently used for smithing purposes.
In the hills at Bellton it crops out 290 feet above Fish Creek, and the same coal is seen in the railroad cut at the western portal of Board Tree Tunnel, 75 feet above track level.
On the head waters of Duukard Creek it is known as the John Taylor coal, and although only one foot chick is highly valued as a smithing fuel.
THE NINEVEH LIMESTONE.
Below the Nineveh coal at an interval of 25 to 30 feet there comes a limestone which has a very extended distribution. It was called Limestone No, X by Professor Stevenson in bis Report K,Qreene and Wasli-

WHITE]

ington Counties, but itis here designated from the same village in (Ireene County which has given name to the coal and sandstone already described.
This limestone usually consists of several layers separated by shales the whole of which sometimes foots up nearly 20 feet, as in the section at Board Tree Tunnel (Fig. 4), but its usual thickness is seldom more than 10 feet. Frequently a stratum of bituminous shale is found interstratitied with the layers of limestone. Some of the latter are quite pure, and furnish excellent lime. It has a very wide distribution, as may be seen from its presence in each of the first seven sections already given. The same stratum extends clear through to Jackson County, West Virginia, and nearly to the Big Ivanawha River, where it occurs high up on the summits of the hills and is hence termed the "Ridge" limestone, by the farmers.
There is a tine exposure of this rock at Limestone Hill Post-oUice, on the Parkersburg and Charleston turnpike, near the corners of Wirt, Wood, and Jackson Counties,West Virginia. It is there nearly 30 feet thick, in several layers, aud contains many minute fossils, all apparently of fresh-water types.

THE HOSTETTEK COAL.
Occasionally a bed of coal occurs at 75 to 100 feet below the Niueveh limestone. It has been stripped out of the run on the old llostetter farm near Burton, Wetzel County, West Virginia, where it is 12 to 15 inches thick and rather pure. It also appears to be present in some localities uear the head of Duukard Creek, and in a local section near lielltou. it was seeu 15 inches thick at 130 feet below the Niueveli coal.

THE FISH 'CKEEK SANIJSTONE.
At 135 to J50 feet below the Nineveh coal, there often occurs a very massive sandstone. It makes the great clill's along the waters of Fish Creek in Springhill Township, Greene County, Pennsylvania, and was designated from this stream by Stevenson in his Report K.
The rock in question is frequently quite massive, and it makes an excellent building stone. It is very conspicuous in the region of Deep Valley, Pennsylvania, where it forms long lines of vertical cliffs 25 to 30 feet high. It may also be seen in clirt's along the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad, above Littleton, in Wetzel County, where it is quarried for building purposes.
THE DUNKAKD COAL.
Below the Fish Creek sandstone, at an interval of 1 to 20 feet, another coal bed is often found, which, from its occurrence along the bed of Duukard Creek for a considerable distance,was named the Duukard coal by Professor Stevenson. It is seldom more than 12 to 15 inches thick, but is almost invariably double, having a thiu layer of slate uear its

center. At Deep Valley, Pennsylvania, however, this parting thick-

ens up to live feet or more and thus separates the coal into two well-,

defined beds, each of which is 8 to 10 inches thick. In the roof shales

of this coal at Mr. Lee Garrison's, in Gilmore Township, Greene County,;

Pennsylvania, tincly preserved fossil plants abound, principally of the*

genera Neuropteris and Odontopteris.

j

This bed is frequently stripped along the streams for local use in

Greeue, Monougalia, WcUol, and Marshall Counties.

THK JOLLYTOWN' LIMICSTONK.
Below the Dunkard coal, at an interval of "5 to ;$0 feet, there occurs a bed of limestone which is rather persistent. It is well exposed in the . vicinity of Jollytown, Greene County, Pennsylvania, and has been dug- j iguated from that locality. As may be seen from its presence in Sections 1 to 5 and also in !),-this limestone has a wide distribution, though at the head of Dunkard (Fig. 1), and on Fish Creek (Fig. .1), the stratum is only 1 to 15 feet thick. In Washington County, Pennsylvania, however, it thickens up to 10 feet or more and is usually a rather pure limestone.
Till'. JOLLYTOWN COAL.
This is the lowest member of the Bellton coal group, and underlies the Jollytown limestone by an interval of 25 to 'M feet. The coal was named by Professor Stevejison from a village in Greene County, Pennsylvania.
This is the only coal of the Uellton group that ever attains dimensions of li to 3 feet, and can therefore be mined by drifting, since in the vicinity of Wise, Mouongalia County, West Virginia, and below this along the South Fork of Dunkard Creek, it is nearly .'J feet thick, and is mined to a considerable extent /'or local use. The coal is not very pure, but in the absence of any other bedsit tinds a ready market. In the Belltou section (Fig. 5) this coal has been identilied with the lowest bed exposed there. This is only a few inches thick and quite slaty, so that it is possible the Jollytown bed is the one nextabove, and which in that section has been referred to the Dunkard coal.
Along Dunkard Creek the Jollytown coal is nearly always present, and seldom less than 1 to 2 feet thick. It becomes a very important key rock over a wide region, since there are seldom any other coals below it for an interval of lioO feet. It extends almost without a break across Greene, Monongalia, Marion, and Harrison Counties, but appears to thin away in Doddridge.
Throughout Monongalia, Greene, and Marshall Counties, the interval between this bed and the Washington coal below is about 275 feet, but westward, in Washington County, Ohio (Section 8), the interval thins away to 200 feet, and practicully the same measurement is found iu Washington County, Pennsylvania (Sections 'J and 10).

TIIK Uri'Kli WASHINGTON LIMKSToNE.
Three limestones were named from Washington, Pennsylvania, by I'rol'essor Stevenson an Upper, Middle, and Lower one and two of these are shown in the section (Fig. 0) from the typical locality.
The Upper Limestone is a very important bed in Washington County, since it has a thickness ot'"0 to JO feet, and is generally very pure. It is usually of a dark blue color, and is much used for macadamizing roads and burning for agricultural and other purposes. This rock appears to be identical with the limestone seen in the bed of JMinkard Creek near the mouth of Negro Unn, above Jollytown, Circeue County, Pennsylvania, where it carries a bituminous shale on its top, lilled with tish remains and other minute fossils, and underlies the.Iollytown coal.
Ill the bed of Fish Creek at Hellion, Marshall County, West Virginia, we tind a limestone with a tish bed on its top, which appears to be identical with the Upper Washington deposit.

Till'; M1DDLK WASHINGTON UMI'.SIONK.
About midway in the interval between the Upper Washington limestone and the Washington coal there is frequently found another limestone bed. It is very persistent in Washington County, Pennsylvania, and is often 15 to 20 feet thick and of a bullish color.
On Dunkard Creek it appears to be represented by a stratum seen just above the road at Kent's Mills, where it is only three feet thick. This limestone, like all of those in tin; Dunkard series, contains minute, undetermined fossils, and the bituminous shales accompanying them bold iileuty of lisb scales, teeth, etc., us well as fragments of plants.

At 70 to 80 feet above the Washington coal, there occurs a bed of impure coal and coaly shale which is often present in the section along Dunkard Creek. Sometimes the entire bed is four to five feet thick, but little of it is ever merchantable coal, being seldom more than a bituminous slate. It is well exposed in the hills about lilauksville, and Brownsville, in Monougalia County, and there contains many bivalve crustaceans.
P.ituminous shale is often found at this horizon in Washington and (Jreene Counties, Pennsylvania, and in Washington County, Ohio (Fig. 8), a coal bed 2J feet thick seems to occur at the same place iu the series.

TUB MARIETTA SANDSTONES.
The Washington "A" coal is often absent, and the portion of the series for 100 to l-!5 feet above the Washington coal is then frequently occupied by two or three beds of massive sandstone. These crop out in the hills below Marietta, Ohio, where they have long been extensively quarried for grindstones and building stone, and they have beeu

designated from that locality. There are often three of them, each 25 to 40 feet in thickness, and separated by thin shales, so that in such eases they might be called the Upper, Middle, and Lower Marietta sandstones. Sometimes, however, as near Rock Lick, Marshall County, West Virginia, the shales thin out and let all of the sandstones coalesce into one mass more than 100 feet thick.
These beds form the great cliffs at Raven Kock, Pleasants County, West Virginia. The upper one is extensively quarried at the Jackson quarry in 1'arkersburg, West Virginia, and it with its associated rocks forms long lines of cliffs up the Little KanawhaKiver, where they have been extensively quarried in the vicinity of Elizabeth and other points.
It is one of these beds that makes the big cliffs on the hill above the
famous Mc(!ugan gas well in Washington County, Pennsylvania. These rocks are sometimes gray, but more frequently of a yellowish or bullish cast, and moderately coarse ingrain. They also occur in Ritchic Wirt, Jackson, and Putnani Counties, West Virginia, where they cap the narrow ridges in long lines of clill's.
In (irceneand Washington Counties, Pennsylvania, andMonongalia County, West Virginia, this interval of 100 feet above the Washington coal is generally occupied by shales, limestones, and thin, sandy beds, massive sandstones being exceptional.

TIIK IILACKNVII.LK L1MKSTII.NK.
Ill some portions of Washington, (Jreene, and Moiioiignlia Counties, a limestone occurs with considerable persistency at .'>0 to 50 feel above the Washington coal. This was numbered Limestone 111 by Professor Stevenson in his (Jreene and Washington report, but as it comes to the surface near the bed of Dunkaid Creek, in the village of IMacksvillc, MonongaHa County, West Virginia, it has been given a geographical name from that locality. The rock is generally gray, quite pure, and only three to five feet thick. It is seen in Section 2 at l»i feet above the Washington coal. It soon disappears southward from the Pennsylvania line.
TIIK lAJWKK WASHINGTON I.IMKSKINK.
At Washington, Pennsylvania, a limestone of unusual thickness (20 feet) forms the roof of the Washington coal, and it, was designated, from that locality, the Lower Washington limestone by Stevenson. It has a wide distribution in (Jreene, Washington, Ohio, Hclmont, Marshall, and MonongaHa Counties, but disappears southward from these. It often attains a thick ness of 20 to JiO feet in Washington County, but is always interstratilied with much shale, and outside of Washington County is seldom more than 5 to 10 feet thick. Frequently some of the layers contain so much carbonate of iron as to prove a fair ore. These iron-bearing layers arc often interstratilied with bituminous shales, and iu such cases tie iron layers are covered with fossil plants. It is on

TIIK WASHINGTON COAL.

This bed, which is the only one in the Dunkard series that is workable over a wide area, was first described by the writer, and named tin* Brownsville coal from its occurrence at the village of that name in Mouongalia County, West Virginia. Subsequently, however, the same ' coal was found in greater development at Washington, Pennsylvania, ' and it was designated from that locality by Professor Stevenson. i It is always a multiple bed, being separated into two or three layers by divisions of slate. Occasionally these divisions are numerous and the entire thickness of the bed is 8 to 10 feet, but in all eases the only pure or merchantable coal is the bottom portion, which seldom exceeds two and a half to three feet. The upper part of the bed is nearly always very impure, since, it contains so much ash and slate as to constitute it a mere bed of richly bituminous shale.
This coal is much more persistent than any other coal of the PermoCarboniferous series, since it occurs everywhere in the northern area of these rocks, and does not disappear to the southwest except bpyoud the Little Kanawha River, in West Virginia, while in Ohio it seems to he persistent even to the southwestern margin of these deposits. In Washington and Meigs Comities, Ohio, it is frequently referred to by Pro
lessor Andrews as the Iloltson coal. faction at Fnrwhigton, Hfttri»n County, \\'es1 Virginia. The following
section of this coal, taken near Parmington, Marion County, West Virginia, well illustrates the structure of the. bed when it is thick:

THE NORTHERN BITUMINOUS COAL FIELD.

[HULL. OS.

Through Washington County, Pennsylvania, this coal has a thickness of 5 to 0 feet, but very little of it is merchantable.
It is frequently exposed along the Ohio River hills between Wheeling and Parkersburg, being at low water in the latter town.
Before disappearing to the southwest it dwindles down in thickness very much, since at Harrisville, Kitchie County, it is only 2 feet thick, and at the Grahauiite mines, near Hughes Kiver in the same county, only U feet.
It is mined for local supply in the vicinity of Smithville, Hitch in County, where it is only 15 inches thick and 150 feet above the level of Hughes IJiver.

At this locality the Lower Washington limestone forms the roof above the bituminous shah-. No. 1, and it also contains much iron.
Occasionally a thin coal is found resting immediately on top of tiie Lower Washington limestone, and that condition of atlairs exists at. Brown's Mills, where a bed of coal and black slate, in all 2 feet thick, occurs 10 feet above the top of the Washington coal. The bed is not persistent enough to merit a separate name, however.

Till! WASHINGTON SANPSTONK.
Very frequently no fire clay is present under the Washington coal, and the latter rests directly upon a flaggy sandstone, often finely laminated, brown, micaceous, and containing vegetable fragments in great quantity. This stratum,which was called the Washiugtou sand-

stone by Professor Stevenson, occurs over a wide area in Monongalia, Jreene, and Washington Counties, but is not persistent very far south if the Pennsylvania line.

TIIK LITTLK WASHINGTON* COAL.

; Just nnder the Washington sandstone, and 10 to 20 feet below the Washington coal, there sometimes occurs a thin bed of coal, seldom attaining afoot in thickness. It is more persistent in Washington County, ^Pennsylvania, than elsewhere, and hence was designated as above by Stevenson. It is seldom seen south from the Pennsylvania line, and in jcireene County even is represented only by a thin bed of bituminous elate.
i TIIK WAYNKSJIURG "It" COAL.
I
! Below the last little coal bed there usually occur shales, thin sandIstones, and occasionally a limestone, down to about 45 feet below the i Washington coal, where another small bed is found quite persistent in Monongalia, Greene, and Washington Counties. It, is seldom more than >:i loot thick, but, sometimes attains to two. It lias never been seen south of Monongalia County, and is of little economic importance.

THE COI.VIN'S UVN LIMESTONE.

P.elow the last coal come 30 to 35 feet of shale and thin sandstones, and then we get a limestone that was numbered Limestone l(a) by Professor Stevenson, but I have given it the above geographical designation from its occurrence at the locality of Section 2, where it is 3 feet thick and quite pure. It is oft en of a bullish cast, however, and contains too much iron to slake well on burning. In Washington County, Pennsylvania, this stratum thickens up to S and 10 feet, but it m seldom seen south of the Pennsylvania line.

TIIK WAYNEsniMiii "A" COAL.

This occurs just nnder the last mentioned limestone and like it is conlined to the northern end of the Permo Carboniferous area. It some times attains a, thickness of 3and 4 feet, but is generally slaty and worthless, so that it has seldom been mined. It occurs quite generally across Monongalia, Marion, and llarrison Counties, and is possibly present in Ritchie County near Ilarrisonville, but beyond that it has not l»een identified. Its horizon is usually GO to SO feet above the WayuesHiirfj coal proper.

TIIK MOITNT MOKIUS LIMESTONE.

:;_

Separated from the coal last described by only 2 to 5 feet of clayey xlialcs there sometimes occurs a limestone which, although noted, was not named by Stevenson in his Keport K. It is well exposed on the north bank of Dunkard Creek at Mount Morris, Oreene. County, Pennsylvania, and has been designated from that locality. The stratum

40

is often only 1 to 2 feet thick, and seldom wore than 5 feet except in Washington County, Pennsylvania, where it is occasionally thicker.
This limestone is uot persistent, and is seldom found south of the Pennsylvania line, being frequently absent even in Greeue "and Washington Counties.
THE WAVNKSnURO*8AND8TONK.
Just under the horizon of the Mount Morris limestone, and separated from it by 2 to 5 feet of shales and .clay, there comes a very important sandstone. This was long ago termed the Wayneslmrg sandstone, from its line development near the town of that name in Greune County, Pennsylvania. It is one of the most persistent members of the Permo-Carboniferons series, since its eastern outcrop can be followed in an almost constant line of cliffs from dreene County, Pennsylvania., clear across West Virginia to the Rig Kanawha River at Winfield.
This stratum ia the only one in the series that is generally conglomeratic or contains quartz pebbles larger than coarse sand grains. On account of this peculiarity the rock in question becomes a very important guide to the geologist in the. interior of West Virginia, where HO many of the Dunkard Creek coals and limestones have disappeared, for it retains its pebbly character over a very wide area. When at its greatest, development the thickness of this stratum approaches 75 and even JOO feet. It is usually a grayish white rock, with a yellowish cast on freshly broken surfaces, and its weathered bowlders are, usually covered with ridges and streaks of harder iron-bearing sand. The rock splits readily and frequently furnishes excellent building stone, the piers of the Haiti more and Ohio Railroad bridges across the Monongahela River near Fairmont having been constructed of it.
Along the western border of the outcrop of this rock it dwindles down and changes its character entirely, being frequently represented in Washington County, Pennsylvania; Marshall and Ohio Counties, West Virginia.; Hclmont and Monroe Comities, of Oh jo, by sandy shales and flaggy sandstones, and occasionally even a stratum of limestone may be found at this horizon.
In passing down the Ohio River below Marshall County the horizon of this sandstone passes below water level, but when it reappears near Saint Mary's, in I' leasants Comity, the rock has regained its massiveness, and is a coarse pebbly nanilstonc, 50 feet thick, and from this point on down the Ohio River, whenever above the le.vel of the same, it is always a massive sandstone. From Hlennerhasset Island, below Parkersburg, this rock is almost constantly visible either in the bed or binds of the Ohio on down to 25 miles below the mouth of the Great Knnawha. It is the emergence of this stratum from the bed of the stream which makes Letart Falls in the Ohio River. It is this rock which forms the great cliffs in the top of the hills at Red Rock, in Put-

nam County, on the Great Kanawha, and the same may be seen as a bed of pebbly sandstone at many points in Jiitchie, one at the famous Grahamite mine being especially noteworthy, for it is the great sandrock through which the celebrated fissure extends at the base of the hills, and it is there 75 feet thick.
Through Ritchie, Gilmer, and Oallioun Countjes a bed of brecciated limestone occurs at the base of this stratum and incorporated with it, which is quite persistent and seems to replace the usual underlying \Vaynesbnrg coal, which is there absent.

THE CASSVI1.LK I'l.AXT SIIALK.
The Waynesburg sandstone often rests directly on the underlying Waynesburg coal, but more, frequently a bed of dark gray shale, f> to 15 feet thick, intervenes. This shale is always prolific in fossil plants ami is especially so in the vicinity of Cassville, Monongalia County, West Virginia. It is from this locality and horizon that- so many of the fossil plants were obtained which are described.in the Second Geological Survey, Pennsylvania, Report PP, by Fontaine and White, and it is from the same shale that so many plants of Permian and even JYiassie types' have been procured, Ta-niopteris, Saporta-a, P.aiera, ami Pachypteris being among the number. No systematic search has ever Ue'en made at any other locality, and hence it, is entirely probable that the list of fossil plants could be largely increased were this bed thoroughly explored in other regions. Other promising localities of the Cassville. shale which have been slightly explored are Carmichacl's, Greeno County, Pennsylvania,; Georgetown, Monongalia, County; and West Union, Doddridge County. In connection with these roof shales, and sometimes interstratilied with the top members of the underlying coal, there occur at Cassville numerous remains of insects, the principal ones being fossil cockroaches, of which Gerablattina seems to be the principal genus.

THE AGK OF THE PTTNKARD CREF.IC 15K.DS.
The fauna of these rocks has never been systematically studied and its relationships determined. What desultory work has been done in this line goes to show that the animal forms consist principally of minute shells of crustaceans, fish remains, and insects, many of which are probably nndcscribed. No Mrachiopods have ever been seen in these rocks, and hence one important line of evidence, which might help to determine their relative age is wanting. Some geologists have been inclined to regard them as belonging in the Carboniferous proper because of the absence of the Permian reptilian fauna, and other typos (ioniiiion elsewhere, but as the deposits are. mainly of fresh water origin, the absence of such types is to be expected. Hence until the minute fauna occurring in these limestones and black slates shall have been carefully studied, the geologist must rely on the evidence of fossil plants.

These bare been studied by Prof. Win. M. Pontaine and the writer, the results being published in Report PP, Second Geological Survey, Pennsylvania. The conclusions there given show that the flora is closely and unmistakably allied to the Permian of Europe, since it contains so many types that are peculiar to those rocks or even related to Mesozoic forms. The tacts and conclusions set forth are sufficient to convince Prof. Archibald Geikie that these rocks are of the same age as the reptiliferons beds at Antun.
The conclusion that these rocks are of Permian age has not been accepted by all American geologists, though none have given any reasons for discrediting the evidence of the fossil plants on which it is based, and until it is contradicted by the animal remains or otherwise shown to be erroneous, no other hypothesis is tenable in view of the evidence at hand. The list of plants' from which the Permian ageof these Dunkard beds is inferred, together with the general discussion of the same, is given in Chapter III, pages 105, 120, Report PP, Second Geological Survey, Pennsylvania.
The recent discovery of an undoubted Permian invertebrate fauna in Texas by Prof. C. A. White and Mr. Cummins (American Naturalist, February, 1SSO), confirms the conclusions of Profs. Cope and Marcon with reference to the existence of a great Permian series of rocks in this country, and hence there is no longer any reason for doubting that America contains deposits which are equivalent in part at least to the Permian of Europe. The Texas deposits, as described by Prof. White in the article referred to, arc so exactly similar litliologieally to these uppermost beds of the Appalachian region, that, the description of the one might well answer for that of the other, and there can be very little doubt that the two series are equivalent. Singularly enough the beds have practically the same thickness, 1,000 feet in Texas, and 1,100 in West Virginia and southwest Pennsylvania.

C A P T K R III.
THE UPPER COAL MEASURES, OR MONONGAHELA RIVER SERIES.
THICKNESS, CHARACTER, AND UXTENT.
This series of rocks begins at base with the Pittsburgh coal and extends up to the Cassville shale. The thickness varies between 200 feet along the north western outcrop in Ohio and 380 feet in (lie Monongabela Kiver region, but in the center of the Appalachian (rough a boring at Browutown, Harrison County, West Virginia, carefully measured with steel line, reveals a thickness of 41.'? feet from the top of tlio \Vaynesburg coal to the bottom of the Pittsburgh bed.
Within the interval there belong six distinct coal beds, though only four of these are workable over any considerable area. These coals have their greatest development along the waters of the Monongahela Uiver, and hence the series was long ago named after that river by Prof. II. D. Rogers.
The character of the rocks intcratrntifiod with the coal beds changes greatly in passing from the Monongahela River southward to the (Ireat Kanawha. At the northern end of the basin in Marion, Monongalia, (Ireene, Washington, Fayette, al| d Westmorland Counties, limestone forms about one-half of (he rock material, and the same is true on the western side in Hrooke, Ohio, Marshall, and Hclmont Counties. Red shale is unknown in the series at the, north, but in passing southward from Harrison and Lewis Counties (he limestones practically disappear, and with them all of the coals except the Pittsburgh. With their disappearance red shales come in and apparently replace (he limestones, so that on the (Ireat Kanawha. nearly one-fourth of the rock material in this series is red shale, while the, thickness is reduced to 270 feet. Along with this change in the character of the rocks (here occurs a great change in the topography made, by these beds, for at (he north, where, limestone is abundant, sandstones are few and shaly, so that a gentle, rolling topography results, with a very rich soil and one of the finest gra/.ing and farming regions in (he country, while lo the, southwest, after the, limestones have disappeared the sandstones thicken up and become more massive, thus giving rujrged and precipitous slopes with narrow valleys.

Here, as will be seen from the above section, the Bedstone coal, whicli belongs between the rittsburgh and Sewickley beds, has thickened up into merchantable condition. This coal contains alittlc more sulphur than either the Pittsburgh below or the Sewickley above, but it makes a very fair fuel for domestic and steam-producing purposes. It is softer than either of the other two and would coke well.
The Kedstone, Pittsburgh, and Sewickley beds of this section foot up a total thickness of 21A feet, including partings, aud about 17 feet of this is morchautable coal.

The same lledstone coal makes its appearance in this section ; in fact it underlies all of the region intervening between Scott's and Robinson's Kuns, thinning out south ward as well as northward. It underlies an area of probably 5,000 acres where it is of workable thickness. In the oil-well borings on Doll's Itun, and as far west as Manuington and Fairview, this bed is still present, though appareutly not of workable

thickness.

THK UPPER COAL MEASURES.

From the foregoing sections it will be perceived that the beds in the Upper Coal Measures which have, received, distinct names are in descending order as follows:

Waynesburg coal, llrowutowu sandstone, liittlo WiiyniiHlmrg coal. WayiiPHburj* liiiictttono. Union) own siMiil»tonc. IJniontown noal. Union tow n liinostoue. (ircat limestone.

These several beds we shall now notice more in detail.

CHAUA<!THIMSTH! HORI/ONS.
Tin: WAYNKSIUMM: COAL.
This, the highest member of the, series, is generally quite persistent around the northern end of the. coal field, but followed southward through West Virginia it soon becomes patchy and interrupted, so that beyond the line of Marion County the coal is only occasionally present along the eastern and central portions of the Upper Coal Measure belt, its horizon being frequently occupied, as at llarrisville, Uitchie County, by a breeciated limestone.
On the (Jrcat Kanawha this coal occurs near the center of the Appalachian trough over a small area in the vicinity of Arbuckle, and its structure there is given in Section L'8.
Along the western side, of the Held, down the Ohio River and across southern Ohio, this coal is fairly persistent. It dips tinder the Ohio Uiver !it New Martinsville, but rises to daylight again near St. Mary's, where it is only 1 to 3 feet thick, and quite sulphurous.
In the Macksburg oil region it is the principal bed, according to the Ohio geologists, and has a thickness of 4 feet.
This coal is almost universally doable, being separated into two layers by a. division of shale and slate. This is so common at the northern end of the Held that it is known there as the "horse-back" vein. In Monongalia and Greeno Counties the bed is often 8 to 10 feet thick and separated into tliree layers, the upper division of slate being very tinssilifcrous, and often, as at Cassville, West Virginia, containing many insect remains, together with fossil plants.
The coal from this bed is usually rather hard, and comes ont in large blocks; but it frequently contains injurious quantities of sulphur. This renders it unfit for smithing, as well as for the manufacture of coke and gas, but it is generally a useful fuel for steam and domestic purposes.

UNIX ORE.

.

The shales which underlie the Waynesburg coal sometimes contain a considerable quantity of iron nodules, and they were once mined in

58 THE NORTHERN BITUMINOUS C!OAL FIELD.
Morgan Township, (Jreene County, Pennsylvania, and used in manufacturing iron. The, same ore occurs near Bethel Church, Cass District, Monongalia County, at 15 to 20 feet below the coal.
TIIK I1UOWNTOWN SANDSTONE.
In many portions of Marion and Ilarrison Counties, West Virginia, the interval beginning 5 to 10 feet below the Waynesburg coal is occupied by a hard, gray, massive sandstone, 20 to 35 feet thick. It is finely exposed along the bed and bluffs of Ten Mile. Creek, at and below liiowntown, llarrisou County, West Virginia, and has been designated from that locality. The deep, rocky cuts along the Pialtimore and Ohio Kiiilroiit], beginning 1 milo oust of Manningtoii, Marion County, and extending to the mouth of Mod's Ifun, are all in this sandstone. It is sometimes called the "Gilboy" sandstone, from a rocky cut of that name near Mannington. This is nearly always a water bearing st ratuin, and the oil wells of Marion County have to be cased below this rock iu order to shut oil' the fresh water.
TIIK MTTI.K WAYNKSllttW; COAL.
At many localities around the northern end of the Upper Coal Measure area a thin streak of coal or bituminous slate occurs at 25 to 40 feet below the Waynesburg coal, and it was termed the Little Waynesburg coal by Prof. Stevenson. It seldom exceeds I foot in thickness, and is of no economic importance. It is usually separated from the main coal above by shales and sandy beds, and should probably be regarded as an offshoot from the Waynosbnrg coal proper. It is seldom seen south from the Pennsylvania line, though it, occurs along the Ohio River at several places.
TIIK WAYNRSIH7RG UMESTONK.
Directly under the last described stratum there occurs a limestone of very wide distribution. Its place is generally about 40 feet below the Waynesbnrg coal, though sometimes it is less, and occasionally a few feet more. It is usually of a dark gray color, and several of the layers make excellent lime for agricultural and building purposes. The thickness in Pennsylvania and northern West Virginia is seldom less than 8 feet, and frequently double that, but south westward, toward the Great Kanawha region, the limestone disappears entirely.
TIIK UNIONTOWN SANDSTONE.
At 00 to 75 feet below the top of the series there frequently occurs a massive, gray sandstone whose hori/on comes immediately above the Unioutowu coal; and hence, although the stratum in question is not prominent at Uniontowu, it has been designated from its relations to the underlying coal.
The rock has occasionally been mistaken for the Waynesburg sandstone, which, belongs nearly 100 feet above. It is well exposed at Bob-

WIIITF.)

town, Greene Comity, Pennsylvania, where it crowns the suininit of the liill overlooking Dunkard Creek as a bold cliff.
In tlie Georges Creek coal field a 'massive sandstone occurs 2f>0 feet above the Pittsburgh coal, and it was once referred b\ (lie writer to the Uniontown hori/on under the name of " Westernport sandstone," but .subsequent study seems to place it in the horizon of tin- \Vaynes burg sandstone.
THK I'NIONTOXVN COAL.
This bed underlies the Waynesburg coal by an interval of SO to 100 feet, and is of economic importance only in Fayelte and \Vasliington Counties, Pennsylvania. It was named by Kogcrs from Imiontown, Fayette Comity, where it is well exposed. The thickness seldom exceeds .3 feet, even in the region of its best development, and the coal has never been used except for domestic purposes, since it is usually neglected for the great Pittsburgh bed below. It often contains a clay or slate parting near the center, 4 to (5 inches thick, and is rather too rich in a.sli for a first-class fuel.
Southward from Fayette County, through fJreene, Monongalia, Marion, and Ilarrison, this coal thins away to a bed of black slate, mixed with slaty coal that is often rich in fish remains and bivalve crustaceans, which may be found in abundance near Davistown, Greene County, Pennsylvania.
Along the Ohio lliver at Wheeling, Bellaire, Clarington, and other points, this bed is sometimes represented by a thin streak of black slate or coal. In the Salisbury basin of Pennsylvania it is recogni/.cd by Messrs. Platt, and is there over 3 feet thick, with slate near center.

TIFF. UNIONTOWN I.IMKSTON'I!.

, "'_' ' '

To the division of the "Great" Limestone which immediately underlies the last described coal bed, Dr. Stevenson gave the name Uniontown, since it seems to be fairly well separated from the great mass of limy deposits below. Thisdivision is usually 10 to ir> feet thick, though occasionally it surpasses these figures. The rock is frequently impure and of a bullish color, being niagnesian, and occasionally a good cement rock, as at Uniontown, Pennsylvania. This is the only member of the "Great" Limestone which appears to be persistent from the Pennsylvania line southward across West Virginia to the Big Kanawha River, since an impure limestone only 2 to 5 feet thick occurs at this horizon in the vicinity of Raymond City and other points in that region.
In the Salisbury basin this limestone occurs only 100 feet above the Pittsburgh coal, and is 10 to 12 feet thick, according'to Platt.

THE "OUEAT" I.IMF.STONK.

This name, given by Rogers, is generally applied to all of the great mass of lime deposits which intervene between the Uniontown and Sewickley coals, though, as already stated, the name Unioutowii is now
givcu to the uppermost division of the same.

THE NORTHERN BITUMINOUS COAT, FIELD.

f 111:1.1.. AS.

At many localities in dreene, Washington, Fayette, and Monongalia Counties there .are nearly IfiO feet of limestones and limy shales at this horizon, and the same beds hold their place, though with diminished thickness, across to the Ohio Kiver at Wheeling. Westward and southward, however, from Ohio and Marion Counties, these limestones disappear very rapidly, so that at Clarksburg on the one hand, and west ward through Ohio on the other, they have practically disappeared, and in their stead we lind shales, gray at first, but gradually getting reddish toward the Little Kanawha River and the western margin of their outcrop in Ohio. On the l>ig Kanawha much red shale oeciirs at
this hori/on. These limestones are of diH'erent *|imlities, some of the layers being <|iiite pure and forming good fluxes for iron, while others are magncsiaji and make excellent hydraulic cements.
The only fossils ever seen in any of these limestone beds are fish remains and minute ostracoids.

TIIK SEWICKI.KV SANDSTONE.

At many localities where the " (Ireat" Limestone is well .developed there are no other beds except, limestones and shales in all of the interval between the Uniontown and Sewickley coals, but in other regions a sandstone, frequently makes its appearance just above the Sewickley coal. This has been called the Sewickley sandstone, and while it is often flaggy, yet again it becomes massive, and even pebbly, varying in thickness from 20 to (JO feet. Its massive character is well shown along the Monongahela River between Morgantown and Fairmont, in the vicinity of the Big Falls.

THE SKWICKr.F.Y COAL.

Directly under the Sewickley sandstone, or in its absence the "Great" Limestone, there comes the Sewickley coal, a bed which is widely persistent, though the area where it is valuable is not so large.
The bed attains its maximum thickness and importance along the Monongahela River in <5reene, Monongalia, and Marion Counties, being there .r> to (J feet thick, with only one slate parting of 2 to 3 inches near the center. The coal is generally high in both ash and sulphur, but is open-burning and makes a rather fair domestic, fuel.
The following represents the general structure of this bed along the Monougahehi lliver in Mari9ii and Monongalia Counties:

Followed down the Monongahela Kiver, the bed retains about the same structure as far as the mouth of Whitely Creek, (Ireene County, Pennsylvania, when the slate partings thicken up, and new ones come iu and dissipate the coal in several thin layers through 25 feet of rock

material, and from thence on down that river it is of no importance. But followed in the other direction, up the Monongahela, this bed holds a thickness of<> to ii feet through Marion County until the Harrison County line is approached, when it again splits up into three or four divisions separated by several feet of shales and slates, anil when Clarksburg is reached there remains only 1 foot of coal at this horizon (Section 18), which soon disappears entirely toward the southwest.
From the Monongahela region this coal dips down westward under the great mantle of Permo-Carboniferons beds, and when it reappears on the Ohio Eiver, in the vicinity of Wheeling (Section ID), F.ellaire (Section 20), and Pipe Creek (Section 22), we find it split up again into three or four layers, and the separating slates several feet thick, thus giving the whole bed a thickness of 20 to 30 feet, with the main coal layer at the top.
This uppermost division of the Sewickley is separated from the Pittsburgh below by an interval of SO to 100 feet, and attains considerable importance iu the counties of Belmont, Harrison, Guernsey, Monroe, Morgan, Muskiugum, Noble, etc., and has there been mined under a variety of names, among which are " Upper Baruesville," " Upper l>ellaire," "Cumberland," " Meigs Creek," and several others. 1'rof. Orton, while intimating its identity with the Sewickley of Pennsylvania (Vol. V, page 1059, Ohio Geology), prefers to call it by the name of Meigs Creek, from a stream iu Morgau County along which it is well developed.
Throughout much of this Ohio region the coal is 3 to 44 feet thick, and nearly always has a clay or bony streak near its center. It also frequently 1ms a rider coal in the roof, and the entire bed is rather rich in ash and sulphur, according to Orton.
In Fayette County, Pennsylvania, the Sewickley coal has a thickness of i to 5 feet through several townships, according to Stevenson, but northward through Westmoreland it thins down and is unimportant. It is scarcely known iu the Ligonier basin, but in that of Salisbury is 2 feet thick and !)() feet above the Pittsburgh.
Iu the Georges Creek basin of Maryland and West Virginia the bed is 5 to 7 feet thick, 90 to 115 feet above the Pittsburgh, and an excellent coal for steam purposes.
The oil-borings across Monongalia and Marion Counties reveal this coal present iu good thickness 10 to 15 miles west from the Monongahela River, and 100 to 110 feet above the Pittsburgh coal. The oil drillers usually call it the "Mapletowu" coal, from a locality in Grceue County where it is mined.

TIIK SEWICKl.KY LIMESTONE.
The interval between the Sewickley coal and the one next below is often occupied largely by limestone, especially in Greene, Fayette, Washiugton, Moaongalia, and Marion Counties, and to the one which

THK NOKTHKRN BITUMINOUS COAL K1KI,D.

ltl'1.1.. 65.

comes next below the coal Messrs. Platt have given the name Sewiekley. It has also been termed the Fish pot Limestone by Stevenson, from a small stream in Washington County. I have deemed it preferable to apply the name Sewicklcy to the whole limestone group which lies between the Sewickley and lledstoue coal beds. This interval is 40 to (JO feet thick and sometimes contains two beds of sandstone intercalated with the limestones. Along the Monongahela Itiver in Greene, Monongalia, and Marion Counties, these limestones are well developed, and many of the layers furnish exeellent lime for mortar and agricultural uses, while near the base of the group occur some excellent limestone Hags at Laurel Point, Moaongalia County.
The only fossils ever noted in these beds are minute fresh-water types. These limestones disappear southward from Ilarrisoii County, West Virginia, there being only 9 feet of them in the Clarksburg section, and none on the Little and Big Kanawha Hivers. The same thing takes place in Ohio, westward from Washington County, the interval being occupied by shales and sandstones. In Pennsylvania this Sewickley limestone holds a prominent place eastward from Washington and Greene, through Fayette, Westmorelaud, aud Somerset Comities.

THE KKDSTONK COAL.

In Fayette County, Pennsylvania, a small coal was found cropping

out along Hedstone Creek, at an interval of 40 to 45 feet above the

Pittsburgh, and this was named from that stream by the geologists

of the First Pennsylvania Geological Survey.

Monongalia is the only county in West Virginia where this bed is

workable, it being there, on Scott's and Robinson's Ifuns, 4 to H feet

thick and of fair quality, though having rather too much sulphur and

ash for manufacturing purposes, it is also workable in several town-

ships of Fayette and Westmorland, being 3 to 4 feet thick. In the

Salisbury basin of Somerset County, Messrs. IMatt identify the Ited-

stoni 1 coal as a slaty bed, 4 feet thick, at -15 feet above the Pittsburgh.

It lias not been reliably reported from the Georges Creek lield unless

it be represented by one of the rider layers in the roof of the Pitts-

burgh bed.

In the vicinity of Wheeling, JJellaire, and other points on the Ohio

Uiver, this bed is only a few inches thick, never becoming workable

anywhere in Ohio.

Through central West Virginia, beyond the Little Kanawha, its pres-

ence is unknown except by a bed of black slate which is occasionally

seen at this horizon.

TIIK KKDSTOXH LIMESTONE.

At many localities along the Monongahela Kiver in Harrison, Marion, Monongalia. Greene, Washington, Fayette, and Westmorland Conn ties, there occurs a bed of limestone often 10 to -0 feet thick, and. iin-

mediately underlying the Itedstone coal. From this latter fact it was termed the Itedstone limestone by Messrs. Platt, who find the same bed in Somerset County,-10 to 15 feet above the Pittsburgh coal. It often contains several layers, which make fairly good lime for many purposes, aud is occasionally used for tltix in iron furnaces.
This limestone is also in great force in the vicinity of Wheeling, licl laire, and viciuity, where it occupies nearly the cut ire interval between the Itedstone and Pittsburgh coals, and is extensively quarried as a tiux for the furnaces there.
It, like all the other limestones, disappears south west ward through West Virgiuia, aud is not known beyond the Little Kanawha River.

THE riTTSHUHtill 8ANDS10NK.
Very frequently, and especially when the Itedstone limestone is well developed, there is nothing but shales intervening between it and the Pittsburgh coal, but when the limestone is absent, or but poorly represented, there is often present a coarse, massive sandstone immediately above the Pittsburgh coal, and to this Mr. 11. 1). Rogers long ago gave the name of Pittsburgh sandstone. It varies in thickness from L'5 up to 70 feet, and is usually coarse, friable, and often pebbly. Hood building stone has never been obtained from it, since it yields so readily to atmospheric agencies.
This rock is especially massive in the vicinity of Hartford City, Pomeroy, aud other contiguous regions, and the same may be said of the eastern line of its outcrop from Pennsylvania clear across West Virginia to the Kentucky border.
In the Georges ('reek, Salisbury, and Ligonicr basins, however, this rock makes but little show iu the topography, its place being occupied by soft shales.
TIIK rlTTSUUHiai COAL.
The last and lowest member of the Upper Coal Measures is the celebrated Pittsburgh bed, the most important mineral deposit of the Appalachian field.
It was formerly thought that this coal bed was entirely persistent; that wherever its horizon was to be found, there the coal might be expected with absolute certainty. This generalization, however, was founded on data obtained only from the northern half of its area. In Pennsylvania, for instance, no area has yet been discovered where, at the proper geological horizon for this bed, it does not exist. Kven in central Hreene, at a depth of 1,500 feet below the Pcrino-Carbouiferous summits, the drill of the petroleum seeker invariably finds this coal bed, while the isolated peak of Itonnd Top, in the Broad Top coal basin of Bedford County, 50 miles distant from any other outcrop of the coal, likewise contains it. lint when we pass southwest ward across the West Virgiuia aud Ohio coal field, Pennsylvania conditions of course continue

for many miles, lint ultimately there comes tt change, and when we look for the Pittsburgh bed it is goii'e, or so reduced in thickness that the geologist can only recognise it by its associated rocks. The region of country covered by this barren area is quite extensive, and seems to be rudely coincident with the line of the Volcano or Burning Springs anticlinal of West Virginia.
The following counties in that State have the coal but poorly developed or wanting at the horizon where it belongs: Calhoun, Koane, VVirt, Kitchie, I'leasants, and Wood. This belt projected northward through Ohio takes in the counties of Washington, Noble, and Morgan, in all of which tho coal is thin or wanting altogether. Thus it
happens that over a belt of country 30 to 50 miles wide, and running nearly north and south across the Appalachian coal Held, the spread of this bed, so even and persistent at the north, is here irregular, interrupted, and wanting. West from this belt the coal comes in again and is fairly regular in parts of Kanawha, Pntnain, and Mason Counties, east from the Big Kauawha; but west from that stream the bed is thin, patchy, and of little importance through Cabell and Wayue, till it disappears from the center of the great Appalachian trough iu tho hilltop*) overlooking the Big Sandy Kiver.
In Ohio, also, a considerable area of this coal comes in west from the barren belt, and extends through Meigs and Athens Counties with fairly good thickness, but westward from them, in Gallia, the coal is again thin and uncertain.
The foregoing sections, Nos. 11 to 3li inclusive, show in a general way the detailed structure of the 1'ittsburgh coal, so that only a few others need be given in this connection to exhibit its structure in every important region of its widely extended area..
As will be seen from these sections, the coal is nearly always separated into two well defined portions (the roof and the main bench) by a layer of clay, and there are often several divisions of the roof, as also of the main bench. The layers of coal in the roof are usually not more thanl to l.l feet thick, and separated by shales of about the same thickness, while the divisions of slate in the main bench are mere knife edges, seldom exceeding an inch in thickness and generally.not wore than half that amount.
Along the Monongahela liiver, two of these slates are especially constant, since they come about '2.^ to 3 feet above the bottom of the bed and are 4 to 0 inches apart. They are usually known as the " bearing in" slates, and are seldom more than one-half inch thick. Then 1 to U feet below these there is generally another thin parting of slate which runs through tho bed with great persistency, dividing the lower portion
ii into two layers known by the miners as the "brick" coal, and "bottom " coal. Of course there are other partings which occasionally make their appearance in the bed at some localities, but they are irregular and not persistent.

As will be seen from the above, it would appear that the three main divisions of the Pittsburgh bed, viz, " breast," " brick," and " bottom," are here separated by shales, 1(5 and 18 feet thick respectively, instead of mere partings of a fraction of an inch, as on the Monongahela and elsewhere, thus spreading the 21 feet of coal through an interval of 55 feet. It is also worthy of note that although the partings have here increased so wonderfully, yet the total thickness of coal remains the same as in the central part of the Georges Creek P»asin.

FOSSILS OF THE UPPER COAL MEASURES.

A carefnl comparison of the structure of this famous bed at a great many points very widely separated exhibits such a striking resemblance to that just given above that we can scarcely attribute it to chance, but must find the explanation in the prevalence of nearly uniform conditions over the immense area covered by the Pittsburgh marsh.
The great excellence of this coal for steam and domestic purposes, and also for the manufacture of gas and coke, combine to render it the most, valuable bed of coal in the entire Appalachian field.
Page plate (5 gives a view of this bed at Connellsville, the center of the coke-making indnstry, and in this the peculiar columnar structure of a typical coking coal is fairly shown.
It was formerly believed that this bed would not make first-class coke over any large area outside of the Connellsville basin, but recent developments along the Monongahela River in Marion and Monongalia Counties, West Virginia, have proved this belief erroneous, since it is there successfully coked on a large scale.
By crushing and washing, where there is too much sulphur present, there is no reason why this bed will not make coke equal to that of the Conuellsville, throughout all of the region south and west from the latter.
The roof coals of this bed are never mined; not because they do not furnish good fuel, but because they are always interstratified with shale, which renders the mining difficult. These roof layers often amount to 3 or 4 feet of good coal, and thus this large quantity of fuel is continually wasted, though the time will doubtless come in the distant future when the Pittsburgh bed will be mined over again for the
coal now neglected in its roof and bottom.

FOSSILS OF TIIK IJPl'F.U COAI. MKAStJIiF.s'.
The flora of the Pittsburgh roof shales as well as of the entire Upper Coal Measures is very meager, and only a few of the very common types, like Ncnropterix hirxuta, N. Jlexuosu, and Pi'coptcrix <trborcsrcns, are usually found, while the fauna of the whole group, so far as known at present, seems to be restricted to fresh water types.

CHAPTER IV.
THE BARREN MEASURES, OR ELK RIVER SERIES.
i THICKNESS, CHARACTER, AND EXTENT.
Below the Pittsburgh bed we descend into a very natural group of rocks (No. XIV) which was long ago clearly recognized by the Rogers brothers in both Pennsylvania and Virginia. The group as defined by them extended from the base of the Pittsburgh coal down to the top of the Mahoning sandstone, and was called the Lower Barren Measures; but subsequent investigation seems to render it more desirable to extend the group downward so as to include the Mahoniug sandstone. This brings the group within the definite limits of two important and very persistent coal beds, the Pittsburgh above and the Upper Freeport below ; and hence, for purposes of comparison, study, and all the uses which classification subserves, is more desirable than the old system, since the top of- the Mahoning sandstone is too variable a quantity for the limit of any group.
I have already indicated in a previous chapter that a larger view of the Carboniferous Measures, which overlooks details invaluable for classification to the working geologist, would run a line through the middle of the Barren Measures, and call everything above it, to the top of the Dnnkard Creek series, Upper Carboniferous; that below it, to the base of the Pottsville conglomerate, Middle Carboniferous, and the rest down to the Catskill, Lower Carboniferous. Such a classification of the Appalachian Carboniferous may be useful for comparison with the Carboniferous system in other regions and countries, but it is too general for the practical geologist, and can never supplant that which has stood the test of long and continuous use. Hence we deem it best to retain the limits of the Barren Measures intact, with the slight modification just suggested, and already long in use by tue Second Geological Survey of Pennsylvania.
1 have adopted the name Elk River series as a geographical designation for these beds, since they are very finely exposed along that stream between its mouth at Charleston, West Virginia, and Bnixtou CourtHouse, or Suttou, nearly 100 miles above.

THE ELK RIVKU SKK1K8.

This series, as thus limited above and below by important coal beds, consists of two very different members; an upper one composed largely of shales, therefore soft, easily eroded, and always making rounded hills and rolling topography; the other, or lower, composed largely of massive sandstones which resist erosion and thus form steep cliffs, deep gorges, rugged topography, and wild scenery generally.
These sand rocks form a coping to the Lower Coal Measure hills, and cap the summits long after the soft beds above have disappeared.
The soil formed by the soft member, while rather thin and not to be compared in fertility to that of the Upper Coal Measures, yet with care and a liberal use of lime yields excellent crops and always makes good grazing lands. But the lower portion, being almost destitute of lime, and containing so much sa:ul, forms a very poor soil, on which only the scantiest crops can be grown.
The upper portion always contains a large percentage of red and marly shales, which make a broad band of red soil from Pennsylvania clear through central West Virginia, to and beyond the Kentucky line on the one hand, and thence circling around through eastern Kentucky and southern Ohio, back to Pennsylvania again on the other. These red clays are the fruitful source of landslides, bad roads, and many other troubles. They cave easily in drill holes, and thus give endless annoyance and expense to oil and gas drillers. Their tendency to slide causes much expense in cleaning out railroad cuttings, so that a proper knowledge of their character by engineers would lead to economy of money in building and maintaining both railroads and wagon roads.
The coal beds of this series are, with one or two exceptions, noted
for their variableness and uncertainty. They may be in fair development on one farm, and absent entirely on the adjoining one. They are also usually rich in ash and poor in carbon, and although they are patchy in their distribution, yet the main beds appear to maintain the same horizons in the stratigraphy, and can thus be identified with reasonable certainty over wide areas. The sandstones found within the limits of this group are of more economic importance than the coal beds, since the former nearly always furnish most excellent building stone, while the latter are commercially valuable only over limited areas. Iron ore in valuable quantity exists locally at several horizons in the Barrens, and these will be referred to hereafter in detail.
The limestones of this series, like the coals, are generally thin and impure, so that they are of more importance in determining the stratigraphy than for economic purposes.
The, entire thickness of the group varies much in different portions of the Appalachian field, reaching a maximum of 800 feet in the vicinity of Charleston, West Virginia, while along the northwestern outcrop of the beds in Ohio the minimum is not much above 300 feet.
In Pennsylvania and northern West Virginia the average is alxmt
GOO feet, but it sometimes runs up to 030 and down to 550.

This is nearly twice the thickness that the Ohio geologists report for the Barrens along the northwestern margin of their outcrop, but all of the measures thicken very rapidly toward the southeast from this portion of Ohio.

As may be seen from these sections just given, many of the beds which have received distinct names are not persistent. They occur at some localities but are wanting in others, and hence are so variable that they are never all found iu one section.

CHARACTERISTIC HORIZONS.

THK PITTSBURGH COAL ORKS.

In Fayette County, Pennsylvania, a group of iron ores come immediately below the Pittsburgh coal, and have been mined for the manufacture of iron for nearly 75 years. They have been very carefully studied by Stevenson, who describes them in his report (KK) of the Pennsylvania Geological Survey. He gives the following as the general section of the ores :

Pittsburgh coal................................. Clay ............ ..............'.................2 to 8 feet. Blue Lump ore...... ........................... 1 to 0 foot. ('lay...... ...... ................4 indies to 1 foot (i inches. Condemned flag ore.............................1 to 0 foot. Clay ................'...... ......4 inches to 2 feet C inches. Hi); Bottom ore....................1 foot to I foot X inches. Clay ...................................10 inches to 5 feet. Ri'd ling ore ..............................2 inches to (i fcet. Clay ...........................................1 to 3 fi-et. Yellow ttsig ore...................................4 inches.

-

This succession does not, of course, represent the structure of the ore layers at all localities, as the thickness and quality are constantly varying.
The '' Blue Lump" and the "Big Bottom " beds are of the most importance, and it is from the former one especially that Mr. F. II. Oliphant manufactured iron so long and successfully at Fairchance. These ores are confined principally to the Blairsville basin, in Fayette County, though they extend into the edge of Monongalia County to the
south, and have been recognized on the edge of Greeue County to the west.
When these ores are not present their places are often occupied by ferruginous limestones or shales, though occasionally a sandstone stratum comes in close under the coal and cuts out everything else. This interval, immediately below the Pittsburgh, for 30 to 40 feet is more variable than any other portion of the Barrens, and hence it is useless to attempt to classify its rocks.

THE LITTLE PITT8I1URCH COAL.
At a varying interval of 25 to (iO feet from the top of the Barrens there often occurs a thin and usually impure coal bed, which has been termed the Little Pittsburgh coal, from the fact that it is so close to the great bed above. The thickness sek.oin exceeds two feet, and it is often only halt that. The best development of this coal which the writer has ever seen occurs in Fairfax Knob, Tucker County, West Virginia, at the locality of Section 45, where the bed is nearly 4 feet thick and is locally known as the " coking vein," from the fact that it Las the typical structure of a good coking coal.

WHITK.]

THE "BARREN MEASURES.

87

Occasionally there appear to be two of these beds, one at 20 to .'50 feet below the Pittsburgh ami the other at 50 to 75 feet below, but they may probably both be splits from the same bed.
The Little Pittsburgh coal is quite persistent at the northern end of the Appalachian coal basin, but it disappears sonthwestward across West Virginia and is seldom seen beyond Uarrison County. It also fades away southward in Ohio, since it does not appear in any of the Ohio sections, unless it should be the " Jeffers" coal of Prof. Andrews, in Gallia County. That, however, may possibly represent the Pittsburgh bed. In the vicinity of Wellersbnrg, Somerset County. Pennsylvania, there appear to be two of these Little Pittsburgh beds, and the upper contains 3 to 4 feet of good coal, while the lower is only 18 inches thick.
THE PITTSBURGH LIMESTONES.

There are very frequently two limestones in the shale interval of 50

to 75 feet below the Pittsburgh coal, one of which comes above the

Little Pittsburgh coal and the other a lew feet below. They are both

known under the general name of Pittsburgh, limestone ; but it would

be better to call the first one Upper Pittsburgh and the other one

Lower Pittsburgh. The first is seldom more than 3 to 5 feet thick, but

the latter is occasionally much thicker, as*it is the more persistent of

the two, being purer and frequently quarried and burned into lime for

agricultural and other purposes.

,

THK CONNKLLSVII.LK SAXD8TOKK.

;

At a short interval under the Lower Pittsburgh limestone there is often found a massive sandstone which is frequently conglomeritic. This rock rises from the bed of the Youghiogheiiy River at Connellsville, and was named from that locality by Dr. Stevenson. Being one of the cliff rocks in the Barren Measures, it has played an important part in shaping their topography. It is especially hard and massive in the Cumberland or Georges Creek basin, and the rounded hills which hold the "Big" (Pittsburgh) "vein'' rest on a platform of this rock, which, owing to its erosion-resisting power, makes a bold terrace far up the mountain sides after all the soft boils above have disappeared. It is this great bed of pebbly sandstone that caps the summits in the center of the trough south from Elk Garden, after the Pittsburgh coal has disappeared, forming almost level plateaus over thousands of acres where the great Pittsburgh bed is missed by an interval of only 50 to GO feet.
The same pebbly sandstone mark's the snmmitsof the hillsat Beling-
ton, Harbour County, West Virginia, and forms huge dill's at many
points along the Monongahela River between Fainnont and Morgan-
town. At Connellsville the top of this stratum lies about f>0 feet under the
Pittsburgh coal; but this interval is sometimes as small as 40 feet, and

88

THE NORTHERN BITUMINOUS COA& FIELD.

[BUU. 68.

again increases to 80 or 90. When not pebbly it frequently furnishes excellent building stone. The thickness varies from 25 to 50 feet, but it is often absent as a massive rock, and then its place is filled with sandy shales or flaggy sandstone.
THE LITTLK CLAKK8BURG COAL.
By this name has been designated a bed of slaty coal which occasionally makes its appearance close under the Connellsville sandstone, and 100 to 1-5 feet below the Pittsburgh coal.
At Clarksburg, West Virginia, the coal in question crops out along the bod of Elk Creek for a considerable distance, and is li to 2 feet thick, but poor and slaty. It is called Litlle Clarksburg to distinguish it from the Pittsburgh coal, which is extensively mined in the vicinity of that town, and is locally known as the Clarksburg bed.
Very frequently this coal is represented by a bed of black slate, which is filled with fish remains, teeth, scales, etc. The deposit in question is rarely more than 14 to 2 feet thick, and is often absent altogether, so that it is of very little economic importance, (hough in the Wellersburg region of Somerset County, Pennsylvania, it attains a thickness of nearly 0 feet, and contains some good coal, being known as the "0-foot "bed.
THK CLAnKSBl'KG LIMI2STONK.
Directly under the last described coal there often occurs a limestone which is finely exposed in the vicinity of Clarksburg, along the bed of Elk and the West Fork Kiver. The upper portion is there rather slaty, and tilled with fossil ostracoidsand fish remains. The next layers under this are very compact, and come out in peculiar rhomboidal blocks. This eutire limestone series is 20 to 30 feet thick, and some of the layers are quite ferruginous, so much so that they were mined for ore many years ago at an old charcoal furnace on Elk. Some iron ore was also obtained near Clarksburg from the roof shales just above the Little Clarksburg coal, and used in this furnace. The Clarksburg limestone is rather widely distributed in Pennsylvania and northern West Virginia, and is frequently mined, since many of its layers furnish good lime for fertilizing and building purposes.
If;-. THE MORGANTOW.V SANDSTONE.
At 25 to 40 feet under the Clarksburg limestone, and separated from it by soft shales, we find one of the great sandstone horizons of the Barren Measures. This rock was named by Dr. Stevenson from its flue exposure at Morgan town, West Virginia, where it has been extensively quarried and used iu building the State University and other structures. At this typical locality the top of the stratum lies about 200 feet below the Pittsburgh coal, and the thickness of the sandstone is 25 feet. It is^of a yellowish gray cast, of medium grain and hardness, and splits readily into blocks of any desirable size. Scattered

WHITK.]

THE BARREN MEASURES.

89

through the rock are stains of peroxide of iron and also a considerable quantity of feldspar grains, which are generally decomposed, thus giving the surface of the stone a mealy look. I n some of the crevices and cavities of the sandstone pure kaolin has accumulated from this source. The base of the sandstone is often couglouieritic and sometimes brecciated.
This is a quarry sandstone nearly everywhere that its outcrop extends. All along the Monongahela River it has been quarried and used in building the locks of the Slack Water Company. The stone dam, No. 9, was built of rock from this stratum. It is one of the most persistent members of th«j Barren Measures, and often makes high cliffs. It caps the hills in the vicinity of Grafton, West Virginia, where it is also quarried, and it makes a line of conspicuous bluH's from there to beyond Newburg, along Three Fork, and far up into Harbour County along the Valley River. Along the North 1'otomac River, in Mineral, Grant, and Garrett Counties, the same rock is found, and on the Great Kanawha, Guyandotte, Big Sandy, Big and Little Muskinguin, t\nd other tributaries of the Ohio, this bed is generally conspicuous. At Huntington, West Virginia, on the banks of the Ohio, it, is 50 to (»0 feet thick, while on Crooked Run, Monongalia County, near the Pennsylvania line, the stratum is 100 feet thick. It is the first oil rock on Dunkard Creek, and some of the wells produced largely from it. In the deep borings of Washingron County, Pennsylvania, where it underlies the surface 500 to 1,000 feet, this stratum is 35 to 50 feet thick, and generally contains salt water.

THE ELK LICK C'OAI..

Immediately under the Morgantown sandstone, or separated from it by only a few feet of shale, there comes a coal of very wide distribution which occasionally attains workable dimensions.
This name was given the coal in question by the First Geological Survey of Pennsylvania, but/the place of the bed in the series remained uncertain till Messrs. Platt, of the Second Survey, recently determined the matter finally by identifying the massive sandstone above it at the typical locality as the Morgantowu.
This coal attains a thickness of 4 feet in Somerset County, Pennsylvania, and has there been mined to a considerable extent for local use.
In Westmorland, Fayette, and Alleghany it seldom exceeds 2 feet, and is gent-rally less, but quite persistent.
In Preston County, West Virginia, north from Cheat River, this bed has been mined to a considerable extent and is known as the " top vein." In the summits near Bruceten it is 4 feet thick and a rather good coal.
At Morgantown it is nearly 4 feet thick, but rather poor and slaty. South from Monougalia County, it is occasionally seen, but is not so

90 THE NORTHERN BITUMINOUS COAL FIELD.

(BULL. 05.

thick as at the northern end of the field. At Glenville, Gilmer County, it is in the bed of the Little Kanawha liiver, and 18 to 20 inches thick.
The same coal is also recognizable on the I>ig Kanawba, but is there quite thin. In the section (48) at Huntingtou, West Virginia, Mr. Selby finds this coal 2 feet thick but very slaty.
It is not often reported by the Ohio geologists, and hence may frequently be absent from the measures in that State.

THE ELK LICK LIMESTONE.
fn sections .37 and 43, a limestone is seen at a short interval below the Elk Lick coal, and from its occurrence at this horizon in Somerset County, Pennsylvania, it has been termed the Nik Lick limestone by Mr. Franklin 1'latt, of the Second Geological Survey, Pennsylvania. The stratum in question occurs at 200 to 240 feet under the Pittsburgh coal, and is not al way* present.
As exhibited in Somerset County, Pennsylvania, this limestone is of a light gray color, and often tinged with buff, the same being true of it in Monongalia. Platt reports it as 12 feet thick in Somerset, but in Monongalia it is only about half that, and is not persistent.

THK ClilNOIDAI. LIMESTONE (GREEN FOSSIUFF.KOfS LIMESTONE, AMKS LIMESTONE).
The next step downward in the rocks takes ns to a very important horizon and one which marks a change from fresh or brackish water deposits to marine conditions, for here we get abundant marine fossils for the first time in descending the column of rocks.
The bed in which these fossils occur has received several names. The geologists of the First Geological Survey of Pennsylvania called it the Green Fossiliferous limestone, the Ohio Survey has termed it the Ames limestone, while the Second Geological Survey of Pennsylvania has termed it the Crinoidal limestone. This latter name is so well known now in geological literature that it is probably best to let it stand, though as a synonym and geographical designation the Ames limestone may be retained.
The character of this stratum and its fossils have been admirably worked out by Stevenson, who first showed its importance as a stratigraphical horizon. It comes almost exactly midway in the Barren series, and hence it is a constant datum from which the geologist can measure either upward or downward to identify the rocks.
When once thoroughly known it can not be confused with any other rock in these measures, since it is the highest bed that contains abundant Krachiopods.and Lamellibranchs. and its lithology is distinctly different from anything else. Prof. Stevenson thus aptly describes its general features : "Dark bluish or greenish graj', tough, and breaks with a granular surface much resembling that of a coarse sandstone. * * *. In all cases it is fossiliferous and contains immense numbers of criuoidal stems and spines or plates."

WHITE.]

THE BARREN MEASURES.

91

Its common fossils are: Froductus Neltraxcetms, P. Prattcnidnwi, P. longispinm. P. semi-reticulatus, Hcmipronites crassus, Splriftra camcrata, S. plano-convexa, Athyri* xubtiUta, Lopltophyllum prolifcrwm, Xeacrinus mucro«j»nt(8, together with the undetermined plates and stems of criuoids, x Throughout Pennsylvania this stratum comes about 275 to 300 feet below the Pittsburgh coal, and the same distance above the Upper Freeport, though occasionally this last interval is increased to 3."iO feet. The rock is rarely more than 1} feet thick, and often not so much, but is wonderfully persistent. Even when not present as limestone its horizon is almost invariably made known by the fossiliferous shales which accompany the bed.
Through Ohio this rock is almost continuously present from the point where it enters the State near Steubenville clear around to where it leaves it at the Kentucky line near Gatlettsburg.
Opposite Stenbenville the bed is 8 to 10 feet thick, but this is unusual, since it is only 1 to 3 feet at most points in Ohio.
The interval between this rock and the Pittsburgh coal decreases westward to 200 feet on the Ohio Kiver nt Wellsburg, and farther west in Ohio the interval still further declines to 140 feet, but where it leaves the State at the southwest it increases again and gets to be 300 feet opposite Huntiugton, West Virginia.
Through this latter State the limestone holds its place very regularly in the series from the Pennsylvania line southward into Harrison and Lewis Counties, and it is also present on the Volcano uplift at Burning Springs and other points, still holding its' characteristic fossils. It disappears, however, in passing from this Little Kanajrha region south-
ward to the Big Kanawlia, for when we come to this latter stream the fossiliferous limestone is gone, and its horizon replaced near Charleston by a thin, impure limestone which holds only minute fresh water forms. It is highly probable, however, that the crinoidal bed comes in again a few miles north from Charleston, since on the Big Sandy it was followed 20 to 25 miles above the month of that stream, and there it still retains its crinoidal phase, though getting very impure where last seen in that valley.
THE CHINOIDAL COAL.
Immediately under the last described limestone we very often find a thin coal bed, which seldom exceeds 18 inches in thickness, and hence is of very little economic importance. In Somerset County, Pennsylvania, Mr. Franklin Platt identified with this coal No. 8 of the Berlin (37) section, a very impure, slaty bed, occurring in several layers in the vicinity of Berlin, where it is altogether 7 feet thick, and locally known as the Platt coal. If this identification be correct, this is the greatest development the coal ever attains.
There is only one other locality besides the Berlin region where thia coal has been mined to any considerable Extent, and that is at

Here it was mined and used for fuel in drilling the numerous oil wells once put down there, and it is still taken out on a small scale for domestic purposes, though only 20 inches thick. Some very finely preserved fossil Brachiopods and Lamellibranchs have been obtained from the roof shales of the coal at Burning Springs, since it there comes only 2 to 5 feet below the Crinoidal limestone.
The "Weller" coal, near Wellersburg, Pennsylvania, is probably identical with this bed.
I!KI> SIIA1.K I1KDS.
Throughout most of the Pennsylvania and West Virginia region, the Crinoidal limestone is underlaid by very soft, red, and variegated shales, and marly clays. They make a broad red band in the soil wherever they extend, and are a great nuisance along roads and railroads, since when wet they decompose into a greasy mud, which produces many landslides and slips.
It is this stratum which causes so much trouble to the oil and gas drillers of southwestern Pennsylvania and the adjoining regions of West Virginia, since it is so easily reduced to mud, which runs into the hole and fills it up, so.that casing must be put through the stratum as soon as the drill Las penetrated it. Krom this tendency to slide out into the drill hole, it is termed by the oil drillers the " caving " rock.
Over a largo portion of Ohio and in many regions of West Virginia a hard, bluish gray limestone, not at all or but sparingly fossilifcrous, occurs near the center of this shale interval. The bed is 3 to 10 feet thick, and in Ohio is generally called the Kwiug limestone. It is shown in the West Virginia sections at Burning Springs (47) and at Huntington (48), and it is recognizable at many other points in the State.
The rest of the Barren Measures from this red shale down to theMaLouing sandstone is extremely variable. Sometimes it is nearly all shales, much of which is red, and "caves" in drilling through it, just like that under the Crinoidal limestone, and again as in the Berlin section (37) it contains 3 or 4 coal beds, and as many limestones. Some of these, however, are rather persistent ami will be referred to in detail.

TIIK HAKEKSTOWN COAL.
At some localities in western Pennsylvania a bed of coal is found 75 to 90 feet under the Crinoidal limestone. This bed is mined in the vicinity of Bakerstown, Alleghany County, and it has been designated from that village. As there exhibited, it is not quite 3 feet thick and rather slaty. In the Berlin region a coal called the Price bed seems to come at this horizon. It is about 4 feet thick and furnishes sonic valuable fuel in Somerset County.
In Section 37 will be found some thin coal beds under the Price coal, which are rarely represented in any other section of the Barrens.

THE BARREN MEASURES.

93

Among these are the Coleman, Philsou, and the one a few feet under the Price bed; but they are all local, though occasionally we tiud traces of some of them in other regions than Somerset County. This whole interval for 100 feet below the Crinoidal limestone is so extremely variable that the classification for one region is of very little use in another. An instance of this is seen at Saltsburg, Pennsylvania, where a great sandstone 100 feet thick comes into the series a few feet under the Crinoidal limestone horizon. This was termed the Saltsburg sandstone by Stevenson, but it is hardly persistent enough to classify as a regular member of the Barrens. In the Charleston, West Virginia, region a massive pebbly sandstone occurs not far from the horizon of the Saltsburg rock, and the one which caps the hilks at the mouth of the Big Sandy Eiver may be identical with the same bed.

THE CAMBRIDGE LIMESTONES.
At many localities in Ohio two dark fossiliferous limestones occur only HO to 30 feet apart, and Prof. Orton, director of the Ohio Geological Survey, has named them respectively the Upper and Lower Cambridge limestones. In Ohio these beds generally occur from 90 to 130 feet under the Crinoidal limestone and are always very fossiliferous.
In many regions of Pennsylvania two dark fossiliferous limestones occur, which correspond to the two in Ohio, only there they are GO to 70 feet apart, and the upper one 90 to 120 feet under the crinoidal bed, while the lower one is 150 to 190 feet below the same horizon. 1 have identified the two in Pennsylvania with the two in Ohio, and have also adopted the Ohio names, since the Pennsylvania beds are known under several names in different parts of the field, while the Ohio names are now well established. The upper one is the lighter colored of the two, and while generally fossiliferous, the fossils are not so abundant as in the lower limestone. This upper one was termed the Pine Creek limestone in my Report Q of the Pennsylvania Survey, while in Somerset County it seems to be identical with the Colemau limestone of Platt.
At Morgantown, West Virginia (Section 413), this bed is dark, quite fossiliferous, and lies 85i feet below the Criuoidal limestone.
The term Black 1'ossiliferous limestone of the First Pennsylvania Geological Survey Reports was probably applied quite as often to this upper rock as to the lower one, since at times they very closely resemble each other, and contain practically the same fossils.
The interval separating the two limestones is generally shale in Ohio, but in Pennsylvania it is sometimes a massive sandstone, and 00 to 90 feet thick.
The Lower Cambridge limestone is identical with the one termed Brush Creek limestone by the writer in Report Q. Second Geological Survey of Pennsylvania, but the geological horizon of that limestone was there placed lower than it should have been by 50 to CO feet, since it was considered to belong between tue two members of the Mahouiug

sandstone, instead of above both members, and hence the term Brush Greek limestone should be dropped from the nomenclature, and Lower Cambridge substituted. This lower limestone is very fossiliferous, often being a mere mass of Brachiopods and Lamellibrauchs, of which the most common are Chonctcn mesoloba, Athi/ria subtilita, Pruductus Nebracensis and a large Soleuomya, together with Nautilus occidentalis and Orthoceras cribroxum.
This bed seems to be quite as persistent in Ohio as the Grinoidal limestone, since it is present in almost every section at the proper horizon, from Stetibenville clear around to Ironton, near which latter poiut it is only 75 feet above the base of the Barrens.
In the hills at Catlettsburg, Kentucky, a dark fossiliferous limestone
occurs at ICO feet above the Upper Freeport coal, but this is probably the Upper Cambridge, and the same limestone occurs in the summits of the hills opposite Louisa, Kentucky, at 200 feet above the Upper Freeport bed. It is barely possible, however, that this may be the Lower Cambridge limestone, since the Barrens thicken very rapidly southward from their, north western outcrop. In the Berlin section, (37), the Lower Cambridge limstone appears to be represented by the Philson limestone of Platt. The " calcareo siliceous rock" of Hildreth, in Ohio, appears to represent the same bed.

TUB MA8ONTOWN COAL.
At an interval of 5 to 20 feet below the Lower Cambridge limestone there occurs a coal bed which has quite a wide distribution. It attains its best development in the region of Masontown, Preston County, West Virginia, and it has been designated from that village. It is there, and at many other points in the Preston basin, mined for domestic purposes, being known as the "4-foot" bed, and is a dry, open-burning coal, highly prized for domestic fuel. It is everywhere preferred to the Upper Freeport, which is accessible in the same region.
This appears to be the same bed which the writer described in Report Q, Second Geological Survey of Pennsylvania, under the name of Brush Creek coal, since a diamond drill hole has recently shown that the Brush Creek bed lies 135 feet above the Upper Freeport coal instead of 75, as formerly supposed, and hence it is deemed best to drop the name Brush Creek altogether for both the coal and the limestone. This Masontowu coal is generally the first one above the top of the Mahoning sandstone, and the interval separating it from the latter varies from 5 to 50 feet. Very frequently the coal is only one-half to 1 foot thick, and sometimes it is represented only by black slate.
Near Gallitzin, Pennsylvania, it is seen in a cut on the old Portage Kailroad, where it is only one-half foot thick, but it is overlaid by 3 to 4 feet of black slate. The coal is here 140 feet above the Upper

Freeport coal as measured in the McCoy shaft, which starts at the horizon of the Masoutown bed.
This coal is reported as present at many localities in Ohio, though there it seldom exceeds 2 feet in thickness. It is probably this bed which has been opened near the summit of the hill opposite Louisa, Kentucky, where it is 2 feet thick and rather slaty,
In the Beliugton basin, Barbour County, West Virginia, this coal attains a fine development and is often 1 to 5 feet thick with 0 inches of bony coal near the center.

THE 1HONDALK LIMESTONE AND ORB.
Directly under the Masontown coal there is occasionally found a bed of buffish gray limestone, which at Irondale, Preston County, West Virginia, and adjoining regions, is accompanied by a bed of iron ore immediately under the limestone.
When the ore is present, however, the coal above is generally absent, as is the case at Irondale and Gladeville, Preston County, where the ore has been used to a considerable extent. It varies in thickness from 1 to 2 feet, and is rather siliceous, there being only about 38 per cent of metallic iron in the ore. It conies 155 feet above the Upper Freeport coal, and hence its horizon is assigned to that of the Masoutowu coal, since the interval agrees, and then a similar limestone 3 feet thick is seen under the coal at Albright and other localities in Prestou County.

T1IK MAHON1NG SANDSTONE.
This is the lowest sandstone deposit of the Barren Measures, and although at times consisting of one solid rock, yet it is generally complex. The usual rule is for the mass to divide into two sandstones, an Upper and Lower Mahouiiig, each 40 to 50 feet thick, with a shale interval between containing a coal bed and limestone or iron ore, but sometimes when the group reaches a great development, as on the Big Kanawha (Section 49), it contains three coal beds, and as many sandstone divisions. This is exceptional^ however, the normal structure having only two sandstones with one included coal, the whole series being 100 to 150 feet thick.
The wild scenery and poor soil of the lower portion of the Barrens are largely due to these sandstones. Being frequently quite hard and eveu pebbly, they cap the hills long after all the other members of the Barrens above have disappeared, and they have thus protected the underlying Lower Coal Measures over wide areas where the latter would otherwise have been carried away by erosion.
In Wyoming County, West Virginia, they cap the summits of Guyandotte Mountain at an elevation of 3,000 feet above the sea. Much of the Lower Coal Measures between that mountain and the Great Kauawha liiver would have been swept away but for this massive coping.
It is the same friendly cover that has preserved largo areas of the

[HILL 65.

f. Coal Measures on tbe summits of tbe Alleghany Mountains, and in isolated basins like Broad Top. Tbe great tuuuels on tbe Pennsylvania and Baltimore and Ohio Railroads, Gallitzin and Kingwood respectively, pass under domes of this sandstone group. Some portions of this sandstone nearly always furnish good building rock, tbe Government locks on the Great Kanawha being constructed of it. The same stone is also largely quart led along the Ohio Kiver hills in Beaver County, Pennsylvania. The Upper Mahoning is generally more massive than tbe Lower one, and is tbe conglomerate member, since it is often a mere mass of quartz pebbles, having once been quarried for mill stones on Cheat Kiver near Morgantown. In tbe Great Kanawha region this rock is extremely hard and siliceous, and at many points a mere bed of pebbles, some of
which are as large as an egg.

TIIK-,MAHONING COAL.
This is the coal bed which is so often bound up between the two great divisions of the Mahoning sandstone. It was formerly called the Brush Creek by the writer, but as the place of that coal was misunderstood, it is thought best, as already stated, to drop the uanie entirely, and replace it with the name Maboning, since it comes in the middle of the Maboning sandstone. It is possible that the Gallitzin coal of Platt in Cambria and Blair Counties may belong at this horizon, but owing to the uncertainty connected therewith it has been deemed best not to adopt that name.
This is a very widely distributed coal bed, and frequently attains commercial importance. It is the coal No. 7 of the eastern Ohio series, where it is .'> feet thick and very excellent fuel. It is mined at many localities in Ohio, as well as in Pennsylvania.
On the Great Kanawha lliver, a few miles above Charleston, this bed swells out to a thickness of 17 feet in the vicinity of Ccalburg; but much of this is slate and bone, there being only f> to (! feet of good coal in the bed. There is probably a considerable area of this coal of merchantable thickness in tbe region southwest from the Great Kanawha, since it is several feet thick along (be summits of ridges in the Huff Creek Mountains, at the southern line of Logan County, and the same bed is ~> feet thick along the Tug branch of Big Sandy, and in the Peach Orchard region of Kentucky, where it occurs 1W5 feet above the Peach Orchard bed (Winnifrede). The coal is quite hard, and in many places a " block" coal through this southwestern region. The interval of this bed above tbe base of the Barren Measures varies from 50 to 175 feet, this latter being the figure at Coaiburg and Peach Orchard.

TIIK MAHONINO UMKSTOXK.
Occasionally a limestone comes into the series immediately under the Mahoniug coal. In Beaver County, Pennsylvania, it is often 5 to 8 feet

Till: 15AURKN MKASUUES.

97

thick, and is locally termed the '' Summit" limestone. It is not a persistent bed, being much less s;> than the coal of the same name above, and when present it, is often iiiumre and ferruginous. In fact it is occasionally an iron ore, the Johnstown ore of Pennsylvania being identical with this stratum.

TllK UPPEK ANI> MI1XII.K CANNKI.TO.M COALS.

Along the (Ireat Kanawha, where all of the measures have thickened

up so abnormally, two other coitl beds make their appearance in the

Barren series below the Mahoning coal, and they have been termed the

Upper and Middle Cannelton, from a locality on the Kanawha where

both are exposed. The former has there been mined for a long time in

the summit of the hills, where it furnishes 5 feet of excellent "block"

coal. It comes 90 feet above the base of the series, but the interval

constantly decreases northward, and at Charleston is only 40 to 50

feet. As this interval decreases the coal becomes inferior, until at

Charleston it is represented by some coaly streaks only, about the mid-

dle of the Lower Mahoning sandstone.

The Middle Camiclton coal never attains commercial value, and is

found only in the region of Cannelton and southward. It is slaty,

worthless, never more than 3 feet thick, and comes 20 to 25 feet above

the base of the Marrens.

The Lower Mahoning sandstone is generally of a bluish gray color,

quite homogeneous, and often an excellent building stone. Though

occasionally containing pebbles, it is much freer from them than the

Upper. Mahoning. The thickness varies from .'50 to 50 feet, except in

the Kanawha region, where it splits up into two or three divisions, and

is more than 100 feet thick.

The shales which separate the Upper and Lower Mahoning sand-

stones are sometimes red, or variegated, as in the Sewickley section

(,'M); and, occasionally, as in the vicinity of Tnnnelton, Preston County,

West Virginia, good tire clay occurs at the horizon o,f the Mahoning

limestone.

. -;

Both members of the Mahoning sandstone are occasionally oil-pro-

ducing, but more generally the upper one, this being tlie main oil rock

at Bobtown, on Dunkard Creek, Grecne County, Pennsylvania, and

on Whitely Creek. It is known to the oil producers as the "Dunkard

sand,'' and it is also oil-bearing in the Macksburg and other regions of

Ohio.

The shales which usually intervene between the base of the Mahon-

ing sandstone and the Upper Freeport coal often contain fossil Brach-

iopods and Lamellibranchs, a* well as the common coal measure plants.

They are quite variable in thickness, the Lower Mahoning sometimes

cutting out the shales entirely and resting on the Upper Freeport coal,

while again the shales may thicken up to 50 feet.

TI1K KANAWHA BLACK FLINT.

In the midst of the shales at the base of the Barrens, and apparently

at the horizon which usually contains the marine fossils, there occurs

along the Great Kanawha River a peculiar dep 'sit, known locally as

the "Black Flint." It makes its appearance in the section first at

Charleston, and occurs from there southward along the river until the

Barrens disappear from the summit of Gauley Mountain, 50 miles dis-

tant.

The distribution of the Hint appears to bo confined to a belt along

the river 10 to 12 miles wide, since at 5 to (> miles back on cither side it

generally disappears from the section, so as to be no longer recogniza-

ble. It is not conQned to the Kanawha region however, since the

deposit is visible near Clay Court House, on Elk River, and near the

California House, on the crest.of the Burning Springs anticlinal, where

it crosses Hughes River at the corner of Wirt and llitchie Counties.

The rock varies from 5 to 15 feet in thickness, and is usually of a dark

or bluish black color, though at the California House it is light colored.

Being almost indestructible by atmospheric agencies, it has played a

conspicuous part in shaping the topography in the Kanawha region,

since it protects the underlying beds from erosion. Through the agency

of heat and cold it finally breaks down into oblong and rudely rectang-

ular blocks which everywhere line the beds of streams and cover the

surface below the line of outcrop. The Indians manufactured arrow

heads and other implements fr.mi this material, so that pieces of it have

been found as far north as Pennsylvania. It is evidently a marine

II

deposit, since it is distinctly stratified, and specimens of J)iacin(t, 8pirifertif and Prodncttut arc common in the loss siliceous layers. The flint

is evidently derived from the skeletons of diatoms and protozoa, though

no microscopic examination has been made.

C FI A P T K R \r.
THE LOWER COAL MEASURES, OR ALLEGHANY RIVER SERIES.
THICKNESS, CHARACTER, AND EXTENT.
Below the Barren Measures or Elk River series there occurs a group of rocks (No. XIII) which always holds valuable coal beds. From the fact that they are finely exposed along the Alleghany River, they were long ago called the Alleghany River series, and their geological position in the general scale of the Carboniferous gave them the name Lower Coal Measures. The discovery in recent years that the next lower group of beds (the Pottsville Conglomerate) sometimes holds workable coal, has been .used as An argument by some geologists for breaking up the old nomenclature and rearranging the Carboniferous into new groups, but this nomenclature is so convenient, and expresses the natural divisions of the rocks so well, that it would be very unwise to make any such changes as have been proposed, since it would be of no particular service and would only bring confusion to the minds of many people interested in Carboniferous geology who are now thoroughly conversant with the old and tried nomenclature of Pennsylvania and Virginia. Hence, while for strictly scientific purposes it may bo well to group the Carboniferous rocks on a wider basis as proposed in a former part of this report, yet for every day field work in practical geology, the old nomenclature can not be improved upon.
The Lower Coal Measures, as now limited, begin at the top with the widely distributed and valuable Upper Freeport coal bed (a horizon which is easily recognized anywhere by the field geologist) and extend down through several, beds of shale, limestone, coal, and sandstone till a horizon is reached where a marked change in lithology takes place, the sandrocks becoming harder, more massive, and often pebbly, accompanied with a corresponding change in the character of the imbedded fossils.
The thickness of this series varies greatly in different portions of the field, being not far from 300 feet in western Pennsylvania, and seldom less than 250 feet anywhere in that State, except in the Broad Top field. But westward through Ohio the thickness of these measures declines uutil around the northwestern border of the field it is less thau 200 feet. Southward from this region of Ohio, where the Lower Coal Measures are thinnest, they thicken up rapidly until on the Great Kaiiawha River the series is 1,000 feet thick, and the same on the Guyau-

dotte and Tug Rivers. Just where this great thickening up begins in going.south westward from the Pennsylvania, line is not exactly known, but there arc good reasons for believing that much the greater portion of it takes place be.yond the Little, Kanawha Kiver.
Tim topography made by these rocks is generally very much the same, except where the thickness is very great. It is nearly everywhere characterized by a hilly country, terraced with a series of parallel benches which, as Lesley long ago showed, mark the outcrops of the several coal beds, since the soft rocks usually found with every coal are more rapidly eroded than the harder ones above or below. These coal benches are not confined to the topography of the Lower Coal
Measures, since they are due. to a general law of erosion, but are only more, conspicuous in this series because the coal beds are more numerous and closer together.
Through Pennsylvania, Ohio, and the northern half of West Virginia, with few exceptions, the hill slopes of these measures, while often rather steep, are not too rugged for good arable and gra/.ing lands, and the soils are usually rich; but in the southwestern part of West Virginia, where these rocks have increased in thickness so largely, wo find a network of narrow ridges, generally capped with the Mahoning sandstone, from which the surface falls away at an angle of 25° to 40° to the beds of the streams, 1,000 or more feet below, thus practically confining the arable land to the narrow valleys, which are frequently trenched into the top members of the next underlying or 1'ottsville series of rocks.
It was formerly supposed that this series held valuable coal only in a broad belt around (he margins of the coal field, and that in the center of the Appalachian basin, where these beds are buried under ],.rjOO to U,000 feet of superincumbent strata, they contained no coals thick enough to mine; but the recent drillingof many oil and gas wells over the central portion of the field has proved the supposition to be unfounded, for the drill has many times penetrated thick beds, of coal in this series at localities where, they underlie the surface by an interval of more than 1,500 feet. Hence, aside from local irregularities always to be found in any coal field, there is no reason for believing that the Lower Coal Measures do not contain one or more good coal beds under nearly every portion of the Appalachian field, and where it would seem to be otherwise the inference has been founded largely on defective records of borings, in which no attention was given to the character of the beds encountered unless they proved to be " sands." Hut while it is true that recent drilling has shown valuable coal in this series along the central portion of the trough where it was formerly supposed to bo absent, yet it is true as a general law that the coal beds of this series are thicker and better and more numerous around the margins of the Appalachian field than toward the center. This is illustrated by the

distribution of the Clarion and I'.rookville beds, which are valuable oiily aroHiid the margin of the coal area.
Owing to the geological position of the Lower Coal Measures, their beds have a much wider spread and are accessible over a larger area than those in the Upper Coal Measures, so that when in the distant future the upper coals and the easily accessible areas of the lower ones shall have been exhausted, there will still remain far down in the trough of the Appalachian field a great wealth of fuel which can be obtained by deep shafting. It is true that at many localities disclosed by the drill only one good bed of coal has been found in this series where it lies so deep beneath the surface, but that is also true of the surface outcrops, and many places can be found where not even one good coal bed occurs in the surface section, and many others where two are the exception.
The main strata of this series,which have been recognized and traced over a wide area in the three States with which this report deals, have received the following names in descending order:

Upper Freeport coal. Upper Frceport limestone. Upper Freeport sandstone. Lower Freeport coal. Lower Freeporr limestone. Lower Freeport sandstone. Upper Kittannini; coal. Johnstown (Cement) limestone. Middle Kittanninj; eonl.

Lower Kittannin<{ coal. Lower Kittauuin<r lire clay. Lower KittuMtiinj; sandstone.
Kulirstone iron ore. Ferriferous limestone. I'ntiiani Hill limestone. Clarion coal. Hrookvillc coal.

Other beds have been named in this series wliicli have ;i local dis-
tribution, but those given above are the main one.s which can be traced and identified over wide areas.
Prof. Orton, director of the Ohio Geological Survey, has shown that all of the main beds of (he Pennsylvania Lower Coal Measures can be followed and identified entirely across the Ohio coal field to where they enter Kentucky ; and the writer has receiitly shown (The Virginias, ]88f») that they also stretch unbroken around the southeastern margin of the Appalachian field, from the Pennsylvania line down through West Virginia to the Great Kanawha, and on across the Guyandotte to the Big Sandy, so that the identifications of the main beds of coal, limestone, and sandstone of the Lower Coal Measures have now been carried from Pennsylvania to the Kentucky line, on both sides of the Appalachian field.
As illustrations of these measures, in most of the important coal regions of the area in question, we shall now present a number of vertical sections. The identifications of the several beds in these sections have been made with all the care and light at present attainable, and while it is not claimed that they are final in all cases and free from error, yet they express the best efforts of the writer, and it is confidently believed

1(12 TIIK XOUTMKRN

COAT, ITKLD.

that their publication will serve to stimulate a more careful study of the general stratigraphy by field geologists and those interested in mining enterprises, so that finally whatever of error may be embodied in these identifications will be discovered and eliminated. It-is certain that the first effort to harmonize the- stratigraphy over such a large area will bo somewhat provisional, and hence the writer not only expects, but welcomes, the kindly criticism of his brother geologists, knowing that all will be pleased when the true order and succession of these beds are definitely determined in the several important regions of the Appalachian field.
Ill some cases, like that at Hlossburg, where it has been impossible to identify the main coal beds with any degree of certainty, the writer has given only the local names for the beds, leaving I ho reader to draw his own conclusions from the general structure of the section; but there are very few cases where some one of the seams in a given section can not be reasonably determined.
We shall begin these illustrations of the Lower Coal Measures at the most northern point of the Appalachian Uasin, and proceed southwestward through the field.

I Fere we find a ferruginous limestone making its appearance under what the section shows to be the Middle Kittaiming coal, and it is possible that this same bed may have occasionally been identified with the Johnstown Cement limestone in this portion of Pennsylvania, which would be erroneous, since that bed belongs under the little coal, No. 8 of the section, while, the Johnstown Cement bed, as correlated by Messrs. Platt and others, comes just under the Upper Kittanning coal.
The section also exhibits the great variations that may take place in the thickness of the intervals between important coal beds, that between the two Freeports being here reduced to only 128 feet.

CO It

Tliis section shows that there is a third Freeport coal, coining nearly midway between the upper and lower ones, at this, their typical locality, a fact that has been frequently overlooked by geologists, and that has led to error in identifications. This Middle Freeport coal, as I have termed it, is not persistent; but the fact that there is such a bed in the series occasionally should lead to careful scrutiny of this portion of the column of rocks before positive identification of the
Lower Freeport coal. This latter bed, No. 7, also has elements of possible confusion in its
structure here at its type locality, since, as may be seen from the section, it is a double bed, made so by L'.l feet of tire clay, in which a nodular limestone occurs. It is possible that these -parting rocks may expand to several feet in some regions, and thus give two Lower Freeport coals, as indeed they are known to do.
I have included No. 11 as a part of the Freeport sandstone, since at one locality the coal bed No. 10 thins out entirely and lets Nos. 0 and II unite into one solid sandstone; but it is possible that No. 'J alone should be included under the uauie Freeport sandstone, as originally intended by llogers,

Here the Upper Freeport coal lies 150 feet below drainage and 700 feet below the tops of the immediate hills.
No. 13 appears to represent both the Upper and Middle Kittaiining coal beds, which are brought practically together, and also very close to the Lower Kittannitig bed by the thinning away of intervening rocks.
The interval under the Lower Kittanning bed here is revealed by a diamond drill hole which was put down 150 feet below the latter

stratum. The Lower Freeport coal is not present, but its horizon is clearly
indicated by the bed of fire clay, Xo. 8, at 45 feet under the Upper

Freeport coal. The Freeport sandstone, No. 12, has a large development, and where

it comes to the surface, 4 miles above Newburg, is nearly 100 feet

thick.

Sectinn at Sterling Mines, near tfoittz/lalc, Pennnyleaniii. At the Sterling mines of It. 11. Powell's Sons & Co., Clearfield County, a diamond-drill boring was sunk through the Lower Coal Measures, beginning 10 feet below the level of the main coal mined in that region. I copied the record of this bore hole from the oflice of the company, and it, combined with the surface exposures, gives the following succession (Fig. 88):

The coal at the top of this last section has been identified as the Lower Frceport bed, throughout the Clearfield region, by Messrs. Platt, Chance, and other Pennsylvania geologists; but it seems to me that this section, taken in connection with the one at Clearfield (Fig* 86), tends to prove that the coal in question is the Upper Freeport. This interpretation is further con finned by the presence of the Lower Mahoning sandstone on above No. 1, and a thin coal, the Mahoning bed, at 00 to 80 feet above the latter, while crowning the hills is the Upper Mahoning sandstone, whose top is 100 feet above No. 1. Then, too, the structure of the coal itself is the same as the Upper Freeport, a few miles distant, where it is mined along the Pennsylvania llailroad, iu the edge of Blair County.

Here we get the beginning of an important feature in Ohio Lower Coal Measure stratigraphy, viz: a duplication of tlie Ferriferous limestone. The lower bed, Xo. 15, occupies the regular horixon of the Pennsylvania "Ferriferous" bed, but there comes in above it here a stratum, Xo. 12, of (siliceous limestone, not seen anywhere in Pennsylvania, but becoming the ore-bearing limestone of the Ohio series, and known as the " Gray " limestone, the ore on its top being of the same character as the Uuhrstone ore of Pennsylvania and apparently identical with it.
Prof. Orton, director of the Ohio Geological Survey, thinks that on entering Ohio the Great Ferriferous limestone of Pennsylvania splits into two portions, the upper part representing the " Gray " limestone and the lower or blue portion of the Ferriferous representing the " Putnain Hill" bed of Ohio. Tin's seems to be the most probable view of the matter, though it is barely possible that the lower or I'utnam Hill stratum is an entirely new deposit, and has no representative in Pennsylvania, or this may be true with reference to the upper limestone, No. 12.

This section dilfers but little from that tumid in \\estern Pennsylviiniii. The "P.iihMtoue" or "Uaird" ore, which was not noted in this, is present in other sections at its proper hori/.ou on top of No. 11. The Putiiam Hill, or lower division of the l-Yrriferous limestone, seems to have disappeared, either by coalescing with (lie upper one or failure of deposition, and the same appears to be true of the Upper KittanniiiR coal, unless it is to be found in the upper layers of the complex Middle Kittanning No. (J, which is not improbable.

Section at Clmrlesloii, \Vext Virginia. As we leave the northwestern margin of the Appalachian field in southern Ohio, and pass southeast-
ward toward the other or eastern side of the same, the Lower Coal Measures thicken up quite rapidly, as will be seen from the line of sections which will now be given along the Great Kanawha Itiver. The following one (Fig. Ill), from the month of Elk Itiver, at Charleston, is the record of Edwards gas well No. 3. It begins at the level of the Upper Freeport coal, and the record was obtained from Mr. W. S. Edwards, the superintendent of the gas company:

The thickness of the measures is here about three

times greater than in the .Flocking Valley, 100 miles

north from Charleston. .lust where this rapid thicken-

ing begins has not yet been determined, owing to the

absence of reliable borings between the Hocking Valley

and Charleston, but it is probable that the most of it

comes in Irom the Ohio h'iver southward to Charleston,

since the borings at Pomeroy and Hartford City disclose

no unusual thickness of the Lower Coal Measures.

The identification of coal No. <S in the above section is

open to question, as it may possibly represent the Lower

li:. 111.-Section Kittanning bed.

under Charleston, W. \ a.

There may have been other bedsof coal passed through

by the drill in the well from which this section is taken,

since it is seldom that drillers for oil and gas exercise much care in ex-

amining the drillings for coal.

Colonel Jordan states that no particular search was made for coal here, and hence several beds may have been passed unnoticed. It is also possible that the. top of No. XII is placed about 100 feet too low by the section above, since the ordinary driller frequently neglects to note changes in the character of the strata through which the drill passes; hence it is quite probable that a considerable thickness of No. 115, which the drillers called "sandy shale," may have been really the top portion of the No. XII series.
The Freeport sandstone, No. S, exhibits an unusual development here, and it is possible that the lowest division included in No. S is not really a member of this stratum, but belongs lower in the scries.
No. 10 is probably a representative of the Ivittanning sandstone.

THE LOWER COAL MEASURES.

lit

Here both the Lower Kittanniug and the Clarion coals show in their structure the effect of the general thickening up of the whole column of rocks. Three miles north from this, the Clarion or Eagle coal is a good bed, which, with its partings of slate, is only 4A feet thick, but the partings gradually thicken aud new ones come in till the structure shown in No. 24 is obtained.
A small coal which has been termed the Little Eagle conies into the section in this region, aud seems to have a wide distribution around the southern margin of the coal field. It is a very pure coal and may be a lower member of the Clarion bed.
The Eagle limestone, No. 30, was named from a mining village 3 miles below the locality of this section, where it is finely exposed in the cuts of the Chesapeake aud Ohio Railroad. It and the shales below it are crowded with the Lower Coal Measures fossils, the general faciesof ' the fauna being very similar to that found in connection with the Ferriferous limestone in western Pennsylvania, but the general section forbids the supposition that it is identical with the latter. At one time I entertained the idea that it might be the representative of the Putnam Hill limestone, of Ohio, but a closer study of the Ohio section renders that hypothesis untenable, since the Putnam Hill bed belongs above the Clarion coal and not below, as does the Eagle limestone.
No. 33 is a very bituminous shale, since lubricating oil was once manufactured therefrom, and it may possibly represent the Erookville coal of Pennsylvania.
A comparison of this section with those on the other side of the Appalachian basin at Buchtel (lOfi) and Shawnee (105) will show the wonderful expansion of these beds from 175 feet at the latter localities to a thickness of more than 1,000 feet at Armstrong's Creek, and the same thing is shown graphically in map, Section C. That such a great expansion of these measures should show only the same number of workable coal beds as the section at Shawnee was hardly to be expected, but it is true beyond question. The coal beds themselves give evidence of this great expansion of the general column in the slates and other impurities with which they are interstratined.
The interval (105 feet) which here separates the Middle and Lower Kittanniug coal beds appears excessive, since it is only 100 feet a few , miles below, but there can be very little doubt of the figures given, and
there are no coal bods between Nos. 7 and 17, it is evident that No. must be the Middle Kittanning. The top member of the Pottsville conglomerate is in the bed of the Kauawha, where the section shown in Fig. 115 ends.

No. L'O is known as the "coking coal" in the Wyoming region, since it has the typical structure of such coal, and looks very much like the same (Eagle) bed on the Ivanawha.
The Little Eagle bed No. 22 is also very good coal here, and its inU-rval below the main seam has increased from 20 to 05 feet.

In passing southward up the I5ig Sandy River, at the southwestern line of West Virginia, the Lower Coal Measures thicken up at about the same rate as they do along the Kanawha, as will be seen from the following sections. The first one (Fig. 118) is from a sur-

The place of the Upper Freeport coal here is deter-

mined with comparative certainty by the massive Ma-

honing sandstones, which come in above No. 1, and

also by the occurrence of the Mahoniiig coal, with its

characteristic structure, at 235 feet above the Peach

Orchard bed, and 135 feet above where the horizon of

**' the Upper Freeport lias been placed.

No. 15 is very probably a "split" from the Middle

Kittanning bed, No. 18, and should be regarded as

a part of the latter.

The Lower Kittaiming bed, No. ±J, is given as re-

ported from a bore hole at "Old" Peach Orchard, by

Prof. Shumard, who examined the drillings at the

Fin. llO. 01,1

time the boring was made, and the rest of the section below this is from a deep boring made for gas, about 3 miles distant, the record of which was obtained from

Mr. F. H. Oliphant, the civil engineer under whose superintendence

the deep well was bored.

There has been much variance of opinion among geologists who have examined the Peach Orchard coal bed as to its horizon in the series, some placing it as far down in the column as the Clarion coal, but this section shows that it is either the Lower Freeport coal of the Pennsylvania,
column or else one that is probably a "split" from the latter, viz, the Winnifrede bed of the Kanawha series.

Some have supposed that No. 3 of this last section is

identical with the Peach Orchard bed, but it seems to

occupy a horizon a few feet below the latter, and I have,

_^ therefore referred it to the Winuifrede bed

p j of the Kanawha column.

No. 19, which is locally known as the

"Wartield" coal, is the same one as No. 2li

of Section 119, and the representative of the

Lower Kittanning bed.

The "siliceous" limestones, Xos. 13 and

TIIK riTKi: i i:i:i;i'oiii COAL.

Asniaybescen by thescclions just -iveii,

a very important coal bed comes ;ii the

summit of the Lower Coal Pleasures col mini,

and marks the latter oil' from the I'.arrens

above. This coal, which was named the

Upper Kreeport coal by 1'o^ers, has a very

wide distribution in the Appalachian fielil

and is the source of much valuable coal

and coke. The coal is not entirely persist-

ent, however, beinjr frequently too thin to

i-^^'^^s^ti^c^n. mine, and from lar^e areas it is absent en-

' v' u ' Xa-

tirely, though its horizon in the measures

can then still be determined, and generally without much dilliculty.

The bed is probably more regular and i>ersistent in Pennsylvania than

148 TIIK NUKTIIKUN IJITI'MINOUS COAL I-'IKLD.
in either of the other two States (Ohio and West Virginia), but even there it is not always found in workable condition, being thin or wauling in some portions of nearly every county where its outcrop extends.
One of the main features which characterize* this bed is its complexity, since it is always separated iuto two or more benches by divisions of slate. This complexity of structure is illustrated at the type locality (Section G(>), and so far as the writer knows it is never entirely absent anywhere in the Appalachian tield, whenever the bed is thick enough to mine. These parting slates vary in both number and thickness in dilferent regions, so that there is nothing characteristic about them over the whole Held, but yet in any particular district or coal basin their number and position in the bed are quite regular.
Another peculiarity of the .coal is that it, nearly always cokes well whenever attaining anything like its normal thickness and hence in several regions is locally known as the "coking vein.'7 There art> many districts where this bed will produce coke but little if any inferior to that of the Pittsburgh, in the famous Connellsville basin, and when the latter is exhausted the next source of supply to the Pittsburgh and Pennsylvania region generally must come largely from this horizon. Still another feature of this coal is its tenderness, and by this it can often be distinguished from the very hard Mahoning coal next above, (which often rivals this bed in si/.e), since as a rule the coal from the Upper .Freeport horizon does not bear much handling without breaking up most of the lumps, although they often come out of the mine with large size. This is true of the bed everywhere in Pennsylvania and West Virginia (except in the south western part of the latter State, where it is often a splint coal), and Prof. Orton reports the same thing as characterizing it all over the Ohio lield.
There is frequently alayer of impure cannel or highly bituminous slate in the roof of this coal, and in the Cireat Kanawha region a.fine deposit of cannel coal occurs at this horizon. This is true of the Cannelton locality, but whether any of the cannel deposits on Coal River, south from the Kanawha, belong at this same geological level is as yet undetermined, since the latter have not been sulliciently studied, though the flora would indicate that the. Peytona deposit belongs at the horizon of the I'ppcr Kittanning coal.
The several sections that have already been given (Nos. 50-llil), indicate-the structure of the Upper Freeport bed in many regions, but there remain others where it is equally important, and some of these will now be given.

This poor condition of the bed seems to be maintained southward along the Georges Creek basin to Piedmont (Section 9li) and up the North Potomac (Sec.tion !>3) to near its source (Section !>4) before the coal becomes valuable again, since there the whole, bed thickens up to 8 feet, and is extensively mined at Thomas, on the West Virginia Central .Railroad, in spite of the fact that, - feet of bony, worthless coal still remains near the center of the bed.
In the. Ligonier basin of Westmorland and Fayettc Counties, Pennsylvania, Prof. Stevenson reports this' bed of inferior quality, being filled witli knife edges of slate and containing too much sulphur for the manufacture, of coke, though it often lias a good thickness. This condition of a Hairs is continued southward along the Ligonier basin into Preston County, West Virginia, until we begin to approach the vicinity of Cheat Uivcr, when a great change takes place in the character of the coal, the, sulphur and thin slates disappearing and the whole, becoming a most valuable, coking coal.

This is the same, coal that has long been coked for the manufacture of iron at Iroiidale, Pivston County, and also near Austin, on the Haitimore and Ohio Railroad. At both of these localities the coal below the " big " slate is not taken out on account of the expense of mining the latter.

Southward from this, through the edge of Kandolph, the coal has been

eroded by the waters of the P.uckhannon, but beyond Helvetia and the

Florence Pass we come to an elevated plateau, from which the Uiick-

hannon, Little Kanawha, and Holly (a tributary of the Elk) Rivers all

take their rise, and here, in Webster County, 7 miles northeast from

At this loculiiy, as well as in I'owell Mountain and on Stroiul Creek, a very good <|iiality of splint coal is obtained from this bed.
From Nicholas Court House on southwestward to the Great Kanawha River no openings have been examined along the crop of this coal, but at Cannelton, in Fayctte County, we find it a valuable bed of cannel coal with a thickness of 1.1 to 4 feet, while - to 24 feet of bituminous coal rests immediately on the latter.
Two miles below Cannelton, at the mouth of Upper Creek, the bed thickens to II feet, but the layers of coal are so interstratified and diluted with slate and muddy sediment that the whole is worthless. A few miles farther down the Kanawha, at Kast IJank and Crown Hill, a portion of this great bed becomes the excellent splint coal, 3 to 4 feet thick, which is mined at those localities, but farther down this rivetthe bed again becomes impure and remains practically worthless from Coal burg on down until it disappears under the river at Charleston.

From this point on west to the Kentucky line on the Tug River noth-

ing is known of the Upper Freeport coal, ;iml at Warlield it. seems to

be absent from the section, but this may possibly be due to the fact

that its horizon there overtops the summit of the hills.

In western Pennsylvania, there are large areas, especially in Heaver

County, where this coal is either absent or else too thin to mine; so it

enters Ohio not as a persistent bed, but occurring in patches, and this

characteristic, seems to remain with it there, from the Pennsylvania line

entirelv across the State to the Kentucky border at Ironton.

Even along the Ohio Biver from the Pennsylvania line down to where

this bed dips below the same, it is generally absent* and Prof. Orton

thinks it is still absent in the Hteubenville shafts, the coal mined there

being the Lower Freeport bed, instead of the Upper Freeport as was

formerly supposed.
If lu eastern Ohio it is known as bed No. C in the Ohio scheme of num-

bers, but in other portions of the State, as Prof. Orton lias shown, it

was often called No. 7. The following list of Ohio names for this bed

will indicate regions in that State where the bed becomes prominent:

"Big Vein" of Salinesville, "Dell Boy," "Cambridge," "Alexander,"

"Bayley's Kun," " Norris," " Happy Hollow," " Waterloo."

Section IICKI- Kcnorti, Went Virginia. After passing beneath the Ohio

lliver above Steubenville, this bed never emerges from the same until

within 2 miles of the Kentucky line, and if the Steubenville shaft

coal be the Lower Freeport, then the Upper one is absent over a wide

region along the Ohio Biver, for it appears to be absent in several bor-

in«'s, notablv at Parkersbnrgand Pomeroy. It is reported from a boring

at lluntington, however, as 1(1 feet thick, though where it comes up to

the level of the Chesapeake and Ohio Kailroad at the east end of the

Big Sandy bridge, 10 miles below lluntington, the bed is worthless,

Below the coal just described, at an interval which varies from 0 to 40 feet, there comes a limestone which was named from the same locality as the coal. It is quite generally distributed in Pennsylvania, northern West Virginia and Ohio, but in the southwestern part of West Virginia it appears to be absent, since it has never been reported from the region along the Big Kanawha and its tributaries, nor from the region between that and the Big Sandy.
The limestone is usually of a light gray color on fresh fracture, but some of the layers are always buflish when weathered, owing to included irou. Frequently the rock presents a brecciated aspect, as if made from the broken fragments of an older limestone.
Fossils are rare in this bed except a minute univalve which looks as if it might be of fresh water origin. Some layers of this stratum generally contain a considerable amount of carbonate of magnesia, and occasionally enough to constitute it a good rock for the manufacture of hydraulic cement.
The thickness varies from 1 foot up to 30 feet as a maxim :im, though the average, might be placed at ~> to 8. It makes an excellent lime for fertilizing purposes, and is much sought after to enrich the barren soil lauds above, though it is occasionally mined for use in blast furnaces, as on the Alleghany Kiver between Freeport and Kittanning, where it is unusually thick.
In Ohio this bed has been given several names, as "Shawnee," "White," " Buchtel," etc. There, also, as in Pennsylvania and West Virginia, it occasionally becomes iron-bearing and some or all of its layers develop into iron ore, which is known in Ohio as the "Buchtel" ore, and in Pennsylvania as the " Summit" ore.

THE KOI.lVAIi KIIIE CM.AY.
When the Upper Freeport limestone is absent, or but slightly represented, there occasionally comes into the section at its hori/on a bed of excellent tire clay, which from having long been mined near Bolivar, "Westmoreland County, Pennsylvania, is generally known as the Bolivar clay. As there developed it shows a line quality of non-plastic clay which is used in the manufacture of lire brick and gas retorts. It also occurs in several other regions of Westmoreland County, as well as iu Fayette and other Pennsylvania counties.

This clay has been reported as valuable at only two or thive points in Ohio, viz, in .letl'erson and Mnskingmn Counties, while, in West Virginia it is known to be valuable in only one region, viz, ou Deckers Creek, in Preston ami Monongalia Counties.

TIIK Ul-l'Kl: FllEKFOKT SANDSTONE.
As a rule the main portion of the interval between the Upper ami Lower Freeport coals is occupied by sandy shales or thin Haggy layers of sandstone, separated by shales, but occasionally a bed of massive sandstone makes its appearance at this horizon and it has received the name of Upper Freeport Sandstone. It is quite prominent in some portions of Pennsylvania, but appears to be generally absent in Ohio. It is also conspicuous along the Great Kanawha and in all the region of West Virginia, southwest from there, sometimes attaining a. thickness of 7o feet, while in Pennsylvania it is seldom more than .'ill feet.
When this sandstone is not present as a massive rock there occasionally occurs a thin bed of coal in the interval between the Upper and Lower 1'Yeeport coals, and 1 have termed it

THE MIDDLE FKKKI'OKT COAL.
This bed is shown in Section GO at the typical Freoport locality, and as already stated in connection therewith, its presence in other sections may, have led to some confusion in identifications. It is not a regular member of the series, however, and is probably uever much thicker thau at Freeport, viz, li feet.
The interval between the Upper and Lower Freeport coals varies greatly in thickness, running up sometimes to 80 and again thinning away to 'JO-odd feet, as shown in Section 05.

TIIK l.OWKI! FKKKrOKT COAL.
This bed is quite as variable, or even more so thau the Upper Freeport above. The rule is that whenever one of these beds has a fair development the other is poor or worthless, but in addition to this uncertainty, they are both frequently thin, or practically absent from the section at the same time, so that no one should look upon any of these coal beds as being continuously valuable over wide areas.
As shown in Section G(i at the type, locality of this bed, it is even more complex in its structure than the Upper Freeport above, being split into two well defined layers separated by a stratum of clay and limestone. It is quite probable that this dividing layer may at times thicken up greatly as all other rocks do, and separate the two layers of coal by an iuterval of several feet, thus making two apparently distinct coal beds, but which should really be classed as members of one.
If Messrs. Chance and Platt are correct in the identifications of the Lower Freeport coal in JclVei-son and deal-field, there are large areas in both of these counties where this coal is quite valuable, since it is 4

to 7 feet thick and of excellent quality, though it is always separated into two or three benches by partings of slate.
The upper portion of the Lower Freeport bed often lias a tendency to become cannelly, as at Freeport, and some highly bituminous shalo is frequently present at this horizon, even when the coal is absent.
Another very fine development of the Lower Fret-port coal is in the vicinity of Fairmont, Clarion County, Pennsylvania, where according to Chance it is 5 to 7 feet thick without any partings, and furnishes an excellent quality of gas coal, as it does in the Reynoldsville regiou of Jefferson County.
In Ohio the reputation of the coal as a patchy deposit is fully sustained, since Prof. Orton says of it (Vol. V, p. 10(>, Ohio Geological Survey), "this is a seam the horizon of which can be followed throughout the entire field, but which becomes workable at comparatively few points."
In eastern Ohio it is called No. o, but iu Stark County ami southwestward it is known as No. Oa, while the synonyms, "Whan" "Steubenville Shaft," "Roger," " Hamdeu Furnace," and "Hatcher" indicate localities where the bed becomes important.
If the " Stcnbeuville Shaft" bed really represents this coal instead of the Upper Freeport, then there is quite a large Held of it along the Ohio River, for it is found of good thickness iu every boring as far south as Moundsville, West Virginia, where it underlies the Ohio by more than 000 feet.
Section near Philippi, Barbour County, West Virginia. In Preston, Monongalia, Mineral, and Tucker Counties, West Virginia, this bed is quite thin and often absent entirely, so it is not mined till \ve go south into Barbour County, where it thickens up and in the vicinity of Philippi exhibits the following structure:

Nothing is known of the Lower Freeport from Philippi on southwestward along the eastern margin of the Appalachian Held until the Great Kanawha River is reached, except in the Roaring Creek field, where it is only 2 feet thick and 25 feet below the upper bed.
But from the fact that this coal becomes one of the principal beds in the Kanawha region, and from there on southwestward into Kentucky, it is inferred that it is also a valuable bed at some points between Philippi and the Big Kauawha.
On this latter stream the Lower Freeport appears to be the parent of two valuable beds known respectively as the Coalburg and Winnifrede veins. The former certainly belongs to this horizon, anil the luttcr

probably does, though formerly I was inclined to refer it to the horizon of the Upper Kittanning. Tlie Lower (Joul Measures thicken up so greatly in that region, liowever, ami the intervals separating the (Joalburg and \Yinifrede beds from the top of the series and from each other vary so much that it seems more probable they are both members of the complex Lower Freeport coal. The Coalbnrg and Winifrede beds are themselves complex, being always separated into two or threebenches by layers of very hard slate or bony coal locally known as "nigger head." They usually furnish the variety of coal known as "splint," and the Kanawha ".splint'' is highly prized as a general" domestic fuel. These two beds are quite irregular in their thickness and
one or both are often too thin to mine, but they appear to be much more regular and persistent southwest from the Kanawha than the Upper Freeport, since they furnish valuable coal clear across to the I!ig .Sandy Itiver, the celebrated Teach Orchard coal of Kentucky coming at the horizon of either the Coalburg or Winifrede bed, or both combined. This latter view is the more probable, since at the tunnel near the New Teach Orchard mine the coal is seen splitting up till it is scattered through more than 40 feet of rock material.

The conditions preceding tlie spread of a great coal marsh seem to bave been eminently fitted tor the prod action of limestone deposits, especially in the Pennsylvania and Ohio regions, for, witli few exceptions, a limestone is found close under every coal bed, and this is true of the Lower Free port horizon. This limestone very much resembles the one under the Upper Freeport coal, except that it is usually thinner and more earthy. It also contains the same univalve fossil, and no others, so far as the writer is aware, thus showing that it too is a freshwater deposit. It contains a considerable quantity of carbonate of magnesia and occasionally, as at the locality of Section 103, furnishes material for the manufacture of hydraulic cement.
Considerable iron ore is also found at this horizon, and the limestone is generally of a bullish cast from the disseminated iron. From this fact it and the Upper Freeport limestone above are generally called the
"bull1 '' limestones in southern Ohio. In West Virginia this limestone has not been recognized anywhere
in the northern part of the State, and it is certainly absent entirely along the Great Kanawha. An i in pure limestone is sometimes found in connection with the Peach Orchard coal of Kentucky, which is possibly identical with the Lower Freeport.

THE l.OWKK KHKEPOKT SANDSTONE.

The next lower stratum that has a general distribution over the Appalachian field is known as the Lower Freeport sandstone. Section CG shows the thickness and structure of this sandstone at its typical locality, and there it is seen to be double, with a coal embedded in its lower portion, the whole being Gli feet thick. That the 15 feet of sandstone under the coal at Freeport belongs properly with the main sandstone above is known from the fact that at one locality the coal is seen disappearing entirely and then the two beds of sandstone unite into one solid mass.
This rock is always of a grayish white color, generally quite hard, often containing pebbles as well as much feldspar, which decomposing permits the rock to disintegrate readily and weather into fantastic

shapes. It is more persistent as a massive rock than the Maboning even, but unlike the latter it is seldom used for building purposes. This is owing to its hardness, coupled with the fact that it will not stand the weather well, and also it is often so gnarly and twisted in its bedding that it will not split evenly.
This sandstone is never less than 30 feet thick in the Pennsylvania region, and it frequently rises to 75 and even 100 feet in some localities, making a bold din" or blnlf wherever its outcrop is above drainage, and thus becoming a conspicuous feature in the topography of the Lower Coal Measures.
Throughout a large portion of Jleaver County, Pennsylvania, this
sandstone is 75 to 80 feet thick, and near its center is a very hard caleareo-siliceous layer 2 or 3 feet thick, which may possibly represent the Johnstown Cement limestone, in other portions of the State.
The sandstone maintains about the same thickness throughout eastern Ohio as in Heaver County, and continues on around to .southern Ohio with a thickness of;{() to 50 feet.
It enters West Virginia from Pennsylvania as a very massive bed, 50 to 75 feet thick in Monongalia and Preston Counties, while in Tucker, Taylor, Harbour, and Randolph, it is still thicker and more pebbly even than the Pottsville conglomerate. Southwest ward through Randolph. Webster, Vraxton, and Clay, this sandstone keeps on increasing in thickness, and when the Big Kanawha is reached it has swelled out in a wonderful manner, becoming 250 to .'500 feel thick, and remaining the same across to the Big Sandy, often crowning the hills and ridges with cliffs weathered into turreted and chimney-shaped forms. When attaining this immense thickness it often consists of three or four sandstones, with shales and two or three coal beds interstratilied.
This rock has produced a small quantity of oil at Fairview, Marion County, West Virginia, and is generally known as the "gas sand," iu the drillers' parlance, since it often produces considerable quantities of natural gas.
THK UI'l'Kl! KITTANNIXO COAL.

Throughout several counties of .Pennsylvania a third bed of good coal occurs at 80 to 1JO feet below the top of the series, and to this Messrs. Chance, Platt, and other Pennsylvania geologists, have, given the name Upper Kittanning, though the bed in question is not workable at Kittanuing or anywhere near that town, as may be seen from Sections (50-(j(! along the Alleghany River, since it is thin and unimportant in that region. The Messrs. Platt at one time identified this coal with the Lower Freeport bed in Cambria, Clearneld, and Jefferson Counties, calling the coal which is now termed Lower Freeport there the Middle Freeport, and it is barely possible that this lirtt arrangement of the stratigraphical order was the correct one, iu many regions, siuce, as. already shown (see 00), there is a Middle Freeport coal even

nt Free port, and in addition the Lower Freeport bed is itself so complex that either halt'of it might at any time separate from the other and both become independent beds.
But however the questions suggested may turn out, the fact remains that at many localities in Pennsylvania, at least, there are three distinct coal beds between the Ferriferous limestone and the Lower Freeport coal, as shown in Sections 64, G5, and GO.
Westward in Ohio, however, the Upper Kittanning coal appears to be, either wanting entirely in most cases or else coalesced with the Middle Kittanning bed, since Prof. Orton finds no place for it as a regular member of the Ohio series, but puts it down as a synonym for the Lower Freeport seam. (See Vol. V, p. 120, Ohio Survey.)
In West Virginia the Upper Kittanning bid first appears in the sections along the Tygart's Valley River (90 and 97), where it is 2 to 3£ feet thick, and a rather fair coal; but it appears to be absent entirely in the Newburg shaft, Preston County, unless it is combined with the Middle Kittanning there, while in the North Potomac basin near Davis it is represented by a mere streak. In the Kanawha field two or three thin beds come at this horizon, and one of them is frequently canuel, and the same horizon can be recognized on the Guyandotte River, in Wyoming Comity (Section 117).
Chance says that it is the main cannel horizon in Pennsylvania, the New ISethlehem, North Washington, and Murrinsx ille cannel deposits coming at this horizon. If the Darlington cannel, of Beaver County, comes at this same horizon, then the interval separating the Upper and Middle Kittanning beds has there thinned entirely away, and thus
brought the two into direct contact. This might well be, since the Darlington cannel rests directly on 2 feet of bituminous coal, below which, through a shale interval of 30 feet, comes the undoubted Lower Kittanning coal, underlaid by its great bed of lire clay. This would account for the absence of the coal in Ohio, if it really does unite with the Middle Kittanning before crossing the Pennsylvania Ohio line.
This bed appears to attain its greatest importance in Pennsylvania, along the eastern border of the coal field through the counties of Jefferson, Clearfield, Cambria, and Somerset, where it has been fully described by Messrs. Platt and Chance. The general sections already given show the horizon and structure of this bed at numerous points, so that no further description of it is necessary.

THE JOHNSTOWN (OEMENT) LIMESTONE.
Lying only 2 to 5 feet below the coal just described, there occurs, over a wide region in Pennsylvania, a bed of magnesian limestone, which Mr. Franklin Platt named the Johnstown Cement, from its occurrence at the city of Johnstown, Cambria County. It is almost an exact counterpart of the Lower Freeport limestone of the comities farther west in physical aspect, chemical composition, fossils, and everything else, and

this is one of the facts which, taken iu connection with the entire absence of this limestone in the western tier of counties and in Ohio, has sometimes led to the suspicion that possibly the Johnstown Cement and the Lower Freeport limestone of Butler and Beaver Counties are identical. Still there are other facts of stratigraphy which appear to forbid such an hypothesis, and hence, until it can be shown otherwise by more positive demonstration, we must accept the stratigraphical horizon given the Johnstown Cement first by Messrs. Platt, whoso labors moved it up from the horizon of the Ferriferous limestone, to which the First Geological Survey of Pennsylvania had erroneously assigned it. The stratum ranges in thickness from 1 to 8 feet, and when it is 5 feet or more some of the layers often make good lime for agricultural or other purposes; but when the bed is only 1 to .'i feet thick it is usually too impure to slake well. This stratum has not been recognized at any point within West Virginia with which the writer is familiar, and it thus appears to be generally absent from the series iu that State.
THE MIDDLE KITTANX1NO COAL.

Whatever uncertainty may exist concerning the exact horizon of the coal which has just been described under the name of Upper Kittaniiing, there is none with reference to the next lower bed, for it is such a constant member of the series that its relations to the other rocks are seen in nearly every section. This bed was formerly called the Upper Kittanning, until Messrs. Platt and Chance discovered that the coal last described was a member of the Kittauning group, and then the coal in question was lowered to the name of Middle Kittanning.
In the vicinity of Kittanning (Section 03), and along the Alleghany lliver below (Sections 64, 05, and 0(5), this bed is thin and unimportant, but west from this it thickens up and is the most important seam in Butler, Lawrence, and Beaver Counties, the coal being quite pure and highly esteemed for gas, steam, and domestic purposes, though it seldom exceeds 4 feet in thickness, and is often much less. This is the famous " Clinton," "Rock Point," and "Hog Hollow" coal along the Beaver Kiver. It is always divided by one or more thin slate partings, one of which is usually near the bottom.
Eastward from Butler County, through Armstrong, Clarion, Jefferson, and Cleartield, this bed, according to Platt and Chance, declines much in thickness and value, so that it is seldom mined, except occasionally for domestic purposes.
Still farther eastward, however, in the Broad Top coal field of Huntingdon and Bedford Counties, it thickens up and is apparently represented by the " Barnet'" coal of that region.
Southward from Pennsylvania, in Maryland and northern West Virginia, this coal is sometimes thick enough to mine, though seldom exceeding 2i to 3 feet. At the southern end of the North Potoiuao

coal basin it practically unites with the Lower Kittanning below, and is mined with the latter where that bed is opened near Thofnas; but at the Davis mine, further south, the parting slates have thickened up to 20 feet and separated it from tl*e Lower Kittamiing again.

Here it is possible that both the Upper and Middle Kittanning beds are represented in No. 2, and they are only 15 feet above the Lower Kittanning coal.
In the Great Kanawha field, this bed, although only 3 to 4 feet thick, is very pure and valuable, being known there under the names of "Cedar Grove," "Trimble," "Arno," and others.
In the Wyoming County section (117) two beds are often found .at this horizon, separated by 20 feet of shales, but the lower one appears to be the main coal. The same thing is seen in the Peach Orchard section (110), where the lower one is a "splint" coal, thin, but of excel-
lent quality. Iu Ohio this coal becomes the most important bed of all the coals in
that State, according to Prof. Orton, since it is almost constantly workable from where it enters Columbiana County on the east to where it leaves the State near Ironton at the southwest. The numerous names it has received in Ohio will serve to illustrate its importance in the mining industry there, of which the following is a partial list: " 'So. 4, in Ohio and Yellow Creek Valleys atthe east; " No. 6," in Stark County and southwest ward; " Ilaminondsville Strip Vein," " Onasburg," " Pike Run," " Dennison," V Coshocton," " Upper Zanesville," " Upper New Lexington," "Nelsonville," "Straitsville," "Great Vein" of the Hocking Valley, " Carbondale," " Mineral City," " Upper Zalcski," " Washington Furnace," " Sheridan," etc.
The tracing of this bed through Ohio, and its identification at many points where it had formerly been confused with other beds, is due largely to the labors of Prof. Orton, the present efficient director of the Ohio Geological Survey. The structure of the coal where it attains a considerable thickness, as in the Hocking Valley, is always quite complex, there being several parting slates, as may be seen from Sections 105 and 106.

According toOrton this bed changes in character from a good coking eoal in eastern Ohio to an open-burning one from New Lexington southwestward. The reader will lind the eoal fully described in Vol. V, Ohio
Geology. The interval separating the Middle Kittanning coal from the Lower
Kittamiing bed varies greatly both in thickness and composition in the different, regions of the Appalachian field. In western Pennsylvania and eastern Ohio the interval is usually only 20 to 30 feet and generally occupied with dark slates or shales holding iron nodules, and it seldom surpasses 10 feet anywhere in Pennsylvania, while in northern West Virginia it locally thins away to an insignificant parting, but to the soiithwestward in the Great Kanawha region, and from there across to the l>ig .Sandy, it often swells up to 100 feet and occasionally attains a thickness of 105 feet (Section 315), with some massive sandstone at several horizons. In southwestern Ohio a massive" sandstone .'SO to 40 feet thick often occupies the interval to the exclusion of shales.
In the Great Kanawha region a siliceous limestone makes its appearance in this interval and seems to have quite a wide distribution in that region and soiithwestward to the Big Sandy. It is well exposed near the mouth of Campbell's Creek, and I have designated it the Campbell's Creek limestone from that locality. This stratum seems to be present even in northern West Virginia, since in Sections 93 and i)G, at Moatsville and Valley Falls, respectively, a bed of siliceous limestone occurs 20 feet above the Lower Kittanning coal.
Along the Tug Fork of Big Sandy there are siliceous limestones at

several horizons above the Campbell'a Creek bed, as shown in Section 119, there being two and sometimes three within the horizon of the Lower Freeport sandstone, so that these must not be confounded with the one in question.
The bottom layers of this shale interval immediately above the Lower Kittanning coal-are nearly always filled with fossil plants. They occur in great variety and abundance wherever the rock material in the roof of the underlying coal is a shale, and this is the horizon par excellence for the collector of plants from the Lower Coal Measures.
These beds have been thoroughly explored at only one locality in the. Appalachian field, viz, Cannelton, Beaver County, Pennsylvania, where Mr. I. F. Mansfield has collected systematically for Prof. Lesqitereiix during several years, the results of which are recorded in Report P, Vols. I and II, Second Geological Survey of Pennsylvania. The list includes a large number of species, several of which are peculiar to that locality.
THE LOWER KIT-TANNING COAL.
The next lower bed of this series, though formerly named simply the Kittanning coal by Rogers, is now called the Lower Kittanning. Although seldom attaining any unusual thickness, it is probably the most persistent bed in the entire Appalachian field, and has a workable thickness over a larger area than any other. In Pennsylvania it furnishes from 3 to 4 feet of valuable fuel over large areas in every county where its outcrop is due. Of course, like all other coals, it thins down locally and becomes worthless over considerable areas, but the barren patches on the horizon of the Lower Kittanning bed are fewer and
smaller than those at the horizon of any other coal in the entire Lower Coal Measures. If the Middle Kittanniug is the more important, coal in Ohio, the Lower surpasses it in Pennsylvania and West Virginia, so that the difference in favor of the former in Ohio is much more than offset in the latter two States. This coal is also a composite seam, and when it acquires considerable thickness is often split into several divisions by separating slates. In the Pennsylvania Held these slates are usually mere knife edges, and add but little to the total thickness of the bed, except in the eastern portion of the field f where in Clearlield, Bedford, and Huntingdon it often has a layer of impure tire clay or gray shale separating the bottom member from the middle one.
The " Fulton vein" of the Broad Top field appears to be identical with this coal, though the writer was formerly inclined to regard it as identical with the Clarion (see T 3, Second Geological Survey of Pennsylvania), and bed "A" of the Tiptou Run series is probably the same.
The " Bloss vein" of Tioga County seems to be referable to this same horizon both with reference to structure and its position in the column of rocks (Sections 50 and 51).
In the Georges Creek field of Maryland this is often known as the '' (i foot" bed, and its structure there is given in Section 92. From Elk

Garden southward along the North Potomac to where this bed passes under drainage level, near German, it is so badly split up with slate as to be rather valueless, but whSre it emerges to daylight again on the other side of the Cheat-Potomac divide, near Thomas, it has become a splendid vein nearly 11 feet thick, as shown in Section 94, from which G feet of excellent coal is mined without taking out the bottom member. As already stated, the bed attains its great thickness in this region by the thinning away of the shales which usually separate the Middle and Lower Kittanning beds, thus permitting the two practically to unite into one. The coal from it here is prized for smithing purposes quite as highly as the celebrated Blossburg bed, with which it appears to be
identical. It has also been successfully coked in this Tucker County field, since it is nearly always a good coking coal everywhere.
Section at Ncicbnrg, Preston County, West Virginia. In the deep shaft at Newburg, Preston County, West Virginia, the Lower Kittanning has the following structure:

Sections 05 and 06 show the structure of this bed where it is brought to the surface by the Chestnut Ridge anticlinal, on the Tygart's Valley River, below Grafton, West Virginia, and, as will be seen, it is there about 5 feet thick.
On the Great Kanawha River, above Charleston, this is one of the princip.il coal beds, and has long been known there as the Campbell's Creek vein. At this locality on Campbell's Creek the coal is 4 to G feet thick with only two parting slates, but in passing southward up the Kanawha new partings come in and the old ones thicken up until the bed, with its included rock partings, swells out to a thickness of nearly 50 feet, and two of the members are mined independently, the upper one being known as the Peerless bed and the lower one as the Blacksburg. The upper member never exceeds 3 feet, and is usually about 20 feet above the Blacksburg member, which is often 4 to 5 feet thick and is the "Coal Valley gas vein." On the Mount Carbon property, 25 miles south from Campbell's Creek,.the 20 feet of shales which usually separate the Peerless and Blacksburg members of the Lower Kittanning coal thin away to a few inches locally, and both are taken out of the same drift. This is also the condition of afl'airs at the famous Anstead mines of the Hawk's Nest Coal Company on top of Gauley Mountain. At the head of Cabin Creek, a tributary from the south bank of the Big Kanawha. the Peerless and upper half of the Blacksburg member come completely together, forming a bed of excellent gas coal 5J feet thick.

THE KITTANNING FIRE CLAY.

171

In Wyoming County, West Virginia, this coal, which is locally called the " Cook vein," has a good development, the whole seam with its parting slates being about 25 feet thick, as may be seen from Section 117, but the main portion of the bed is about 7 to 8 feet thick, separated into three layers by slate partings of 4 to G inches thick.
This coal rises above the level of the Tug Fork of Big Sandy about 3 miles below Warfleldand 30 above Louisa. It has been mined to some extent for local use at Warfleld, and is known in that region as the " Warfield coal." Its structure there is given by Section 119. Above Warfleld it dips down under the stream and does not come up again for about 10 miles, or some distance above the mouth of Pigeon Creek, but from there on up Tug River it is constantly accessible for .about 40 miles, until the southward rise of the rocks throws the coal above the tops of the hills near the mouth of Ben Creek, 95 miles above the mouth of Tng. Along this line the coal is seldom less than 3 feet thick and frequently 4 to 5 leet, with only one slate parting 3 to 5 inches thick. At the month of Lick Creek and GO miles from Louisa this coal is 100 feet above the river, and reported 6 to 7 feet thick, with only one thin slate near the center.
In Ohio the Lower Kittanning coal is almost as persistent as in Pennsylvania, rarely being absent entirely from the section, and generally having a thickness of 3 feet, with a maximum of 5.
In the deep oil-borings across southwest Pennsylvania and northern West Virginia this coal is quite persistent, being frequently reported at a depth of 1,500 to 1,800 feet beneath the surface.
The following list of names has been given it in Ohio : Coal No. 3 in Ohio Valley and along Yellow Creek, No. 4 at Leetouia, No. 5 in Stark County and southwestward; also " Creek vein," " Potters vein," " Lectonia," "Mineral Point," "Lower New Lexinglon," "Newcastle," etc. % This coal is often neglected in Ohio even when it has a thickness of 1H to 3 feet, because of the great development of the Middle Kittanning coal only a few feet above. Both of these beds have now, through the labors of Newberry, Orton, Eoy, and others, been traced from the Pennsylvania Hue clear across Ohio to where they pass into Kentucky at Ironton, and have been so well described by Orton in Vol. V, Ohio Geology, that it is unnecessary for the writer to dwell on them longer.

THE KITTANNING FIRE CLAY.
Lying directly under the last described coal there comes in many regions a great bed of splendid fire clay which often-overshadows the coal in value, since many millions of dollars are invested in manufacturing the several lines of articles which can be made from this clay. The bed has been named from Kittanning, where it is mined, and here as well as at many localities in Ohio the clay does not all immediately underlie the coal, but some of it is found a few feet lower and nearly on top of the Ferriferous limestone.

172

THE NORTHERN BITUMINOUS COAL FIELD.

(BULL. OS.

Eastward from the Alleghany River this clay does not appear to be very important, but westward from that point it is generally present, and attains its maximum development along the Beaver, and westward from there down the Oliio; the famous potteries at New Brighton, Kochester, East Liverpool, New Cumberland, and other points in these valleys all deriving their clay from this horizon.
In the Beaver County region the thickness is generally about 8 to 10 feet, but occasionally runs up to 15 and down to 5. It often consists of two portions, an upper " soft" clay and a lower "hard" clay, the latter being used in the manufacture of fire brick, etc. In western Pennsylvania and eastern Ohio this clay bed is often a very valuable element
in settling questions of stratigraphy which would otherwise be extremely difficult of solution j in fact it is valuable for this purpose clear across the Ohio coal field, since, according toOrton. although not entirely persistent, yet it furnishes valuable clay mines in every county of its outcrop from the Pennsylvania line across to the Kentucky border.
In West Virginia (except along the Upper Ohio River) the deposit is seldom of value, being too siliceous, and it has been developed in only one region, viz, near the locality of Section i)7, at Nuzum's, on the Tygart's Valley River. Here along the crown of the Chestnut Ridge anticlinal the coal above locally disappears, and then a valuable bed of hard clay replaces it, but when the coal comes in again the clay disappears, just as it often does in Ohio, when the hard Ilinty clay is present. The (Hade Fire Brick Works at. Nii/uins manufacture a good fire brick from this bed.
THK K1TTANXING SANDSTONE.

The interval between the Lower Kittanning coal and the Ferriferous limestone varies greatly in thickness, sometimes only the clay bed just described intervening, and again the interval thickens up to 60 to 75 feet or even more. Whenever the interval attains anything like these last figures we generally find a massive sandstone between the coal and the limestone, and to this has been given the name Kittanning. It sometimes, as on Buffalo Creek, Butler County, Pennsylvania, develops into a great cliff rock of massive and even pebbly sandstone, cutting out the underlying limestone (Ferriferous). It often furnishes good quarry stone, and a rock occupying this horizon in the series has been quarried and used in building the Government lock and dam near Coal Valley, on the Great Kanawha River. In this region the interval between the Lower Kittanning coal and the Ferriferous limestone thickens up to 150 feet, and a local bed of coal, the Brownstown, comes into the series about half way in the interval. In Wyoming County and westward from there the Kittanning sandstone thickens to 100 feet, as seen in (Section 117.
TJ11-: UUIIHSTOXK IRON" ONE.

Resting immediately on top of the Ferriferous limestone there occurs over a very wide area a deposit of iron ore. In Pennsylvania it is often

underlaid with cherty material, and hence Ions -1S° received the name of " IJuhrsrone ore," but it is there also called Ferriferous ore. In Ohio it has a wide distribution and is known under several names, among which are " Baird" ore, "Gray" ore, " Limestone" ore.
The ore generally lies in immediate contact with the limestone, in it slab-like sheet one half to 1 foot thick, but occasionally, as in Lawrence County, Pennsylvania, on the Houck farm, it locally thickens up to L'O feet, entirely replacing the underlying limestone, while again it is absent over wide areas, or represented by nodules scattered through the overlying shales. When the Ferriferous limestone is absent, its place in the series can often be correctly assigned from the existeuce of this ore, as is the case in Section 97, at Nimuu's Mills, West Virginia. This'bed was formerly the main ore from which the charcoal furnaces of western Pennsylvania drew their supplies,and it is still the main feeder for these furnaces in southern Ohio. In northern West Virginia some iron ore occurs at this horizon in Alonongalia and Preston Counties, and a few inches of it may be seen near the coke ovens on (ilady Fork, below Thomas, Tucker County, but in the Great Kanawha region and southward toward the Big Sandy it appears to be completely absent as a distinct stratum, though nodules of iron sometimes come at this horizon.

THE FEKUIFKROUS LIMKSToXE.
The occurrence of the iron ore just described resting upon a bed of limestone over a wide area suggested the name ''Ferriferous" which the early geologists applied to the limestone as well as the ore.
This is the most important and widely distributed limestone of the entire Coal Measure column, important both in an economic sense and as a stratigraphical horizon which with ordinary care can be unfailingly recognized by geologists as well as anyone else interested in determining the correct order of the rocks. It dilfers from the other limestones that we have had so far in the Lower Coal Measures, in being a genuine marine deposit, abounding in fossil crinoids, corals, brachiopods, lamellibranchs, univalves, etc., a list of the more common forms of which is given on pages 46 and 47, Eeport QQ, Second Geological Survey of Pennsylvania.
In Pennsylvania this limestone is confined to the counties west from Chestnut Bidge, attaining its maximum development in Clarion, Armstrong, Butler, Beaver, and Lawrence, where it is frequently L>5 feet thick, or even more, and seldom less than 10 except it has locally thinned away entirely.
Tliis limestone enters Ohio at Lowellville on the Mahoning River with a thickness of 15 feet, but westward it changes ATery much from its Pennsylvania type, becoming reduced in thickness, sometimes entirely absent, and occasionally splitting into two beds separated by 15 to 50 feet of shales, the lower one of which has been called the Piitnam llill limestone from its occurrence ia au emiueace of that uaiue at

Zanesville. Tn one way or another, however, it has been satisfactorily traced by Orton across the Ohio field to where it enters Kentucky from Hanging Rock.
A layer of Hint or " bnhrstone" is often incorporated with the top of this bed in Pennsylvania, and the same thing holds true for Ohio, but below this the rock is generally gray for 10 to 16 feet and of great purity, being especially prized as a flux in the smelting of iron ore, and used almost exclusively for this purpose in the Pittsburgh region. The lower portion of the stratum is generally of a bluish color, and its layers are shaly, being interstratitied with thin films of clay and other impurities, and occasionally a distinct bed of shale separates the blue layers from the gray above. Hence it seems very probable that, as Prof. Orton once suggested, this shale layer probably increases in thickness through some regions of Ohio, thus separating the upper portion, as the " Gray " limestone, from the lower or blue part, which has been called the Putnam Hill. Onone point, however, in this connection, the writer cannot fully agree with Prof. Ortou, and that is concerning the presence of workable coal beds between these two divisions of the limestone. There is certainly none at Zanesville, the typical locality for the Putnaiii Hill limestone (Section 104), neither is there any atShawnee (Section 105), nor at New Lisbon (Section 103), nor Sprucevale (Section 102), so that it appears more probable that the supposed workable coal between the two layers of the limestone is founded upon an error m identification.
Another characteristic of this limestone is that when it becomes thin and impure it almost Jilways exhibits the "coue-in-cone" structure, though there are other horizons in the Coal Measures which show the same feature, notably the Mercer limestones.
The most northern point at which this limestone has been found in
I Pennsylvania is in the southern portion of McKean County, where Mr. Ashburner identifies with it a siliceous limestone occurring in the vicinity of Clermont. In the North Potomac coal basin this limestone has been seen by the writer near Gormau, Garrett County, Maryland, and also below Thomas, along Glady Fork of Black Water. In each case, however, the deposit is entirely different from the marine type of western Pennsylvania and Ohio, and resembles more the fresh water limestones under the Freeport coals, since no marine fossils were observed at either locality; in fact there is no point in West Virginia or Maryland where the marine type of this limestone is known to exist, so far as the writer is aware. Along the Great Kanawha River, in the vicinity of Caunelton, a bed of siliceous limestone occurs 75 to 100 feet under the. Lower Kittanning coal, and it has been identified with the Ferriferous limestone horizon as shown in Section 115. It occasionally exhibits the " coue-in-coue " structure but is not fossiliferous. Immediately uuder the Ferriferous limestone in western Peuusyl-

vauia there are often 5 to 10 feet of black fossiliferons shales, especially when the limestone is thin or locally wanting, so that the horizon can thus be frequently recognized without the presence of the limestone since the fossils in the shales are practically the same as in the latter.

THE CLAKIOX COAL.
Mr. H. Martyn Chance has recently shown (W, Second Geological Survey of Pennsylvania) that the coal bed which comes so close under the Ferriferous limestone in western Pennsylvania, and was formerly called the Scrub-grass coal, is really an off-shoot from the Clarion, and hence it is unnecessary to retain the name Scrub grass, which should be replaced with Upper Clarion.
The main bench of the Clarion coal occurs through western Pennsylvania at an interval of 10 to 30 feet below the Ferriferous limestone. Its usual thickness is about 3 feet, though it often swells to 4 or 5. When well developed it generally contains one or two part ing slates, and one of them thickening up causes the upper bench to approach the Ferriferous limestone, and it was then taken for a separate coal by the geologists of the First Pennsylvania Survey, but, as Chance suggests, this should be called the Upper Clarion bed in view of its origin. This upper member is thick enough to mine in only a limited area around the northern outcrop of the same in Clarion, Duller, and Jefferson Counties.
The Lower or main Clarion bed is of considerable importance in Pennsylvania, and generally furnishes some areas -of good fuel in nearly every county where its outcrop occurs, though as a rule the coal is
rather high in both ash and sulphur. In eastern Ohio this bed acquires some importance in the vicinity of
Leetouia and New Lisbon, and is there often parted by a vein of lire clay 1 to 4 feet thick, the upper coal alone being mined, and vary ing in thickness from 2.J to 3£ feet. Prof. Ortou has also shown that the Canlield cauuel of Mahoniug Couuty belongs to the horizon of the Clarion bed.
Westward from the eastern tier of Ohio counties, the Clarion coal disappears according to Orton and is of no more importance until Vintou and Jackson are reached, but this conclusion is based upon his present view of the Putuaiu Hill limestone, which he once regarded as a "split" from the Ferriferous of Pennsylvania, but which he now appears to reject, since he puts the Clarion coal between this latter limestone and the upper or " Gray" one, and identifies the coal underlying the Putnam Hill limestone as the Brookville bed of Pennsylvania. The writer has elsewhere expressed his doubt of the existence of any workable coal between these two limestones, believing that the identifications on which the couclusion was fouuded are erroneous, so that if we substitute Clarion coal for "Brookville" in Prof. Ortou's Ohio series,

all diniculties concerning the disappearance of the Clarion coal between

eastern Ohio and Terry County vanishes, and the Clarion becomes one of the regular and persistent ,beds of the series clear across Ohio as it

does in Pennsylvania. In the Zauesville section (104) the writer lias

indicated his views as to the equivalency of these members of the Ohio

series. The Clarion coal attains its maximum thickness in Stark County,

Ohio, where it is 0 feet thick and a very fair steam coal, according to

Orton.

In northern West Virginia this bed is generally present in the section,

but is usually slaty and too impure to be valuable, so that it has never

been mined in that part of the State.

/Section near E«gle, Fayettc County, West Virginia. Along the Great

Kanawha Kiver a coal bed, which appears to come at this horizon, has

been largely developed for coking purposes in the vicinity of Eagle,

Fayette County, and hence is locally known as the Eagle vein. Where

best developed there, it varies from 3£ to 4i feet in thickness, and is a

splendid coking coal, having the following structure in the vicinity of

Eagle:

Iii passing up the Kanawha from Eagle the upper shale parting of

this bed gradually thickens till at the mouth of Armstrong Creek, 3

miles above, it becomes 20 feet thick and the coal has the structure given

in Section 115.

The interval between this bed and the Lower Kittanning varies be-

tween 120 and 200 feet along the Great Kanawha, thickening up to the

latter figures at Brownstown (Section 114), but southward from this in

Wyoming County the interval swells still further to 230 feet in the vi-

cinity of Oceuna, as shown in Section 117, where the coal in question

has a thickness of 5 to G feet and is known as the "coking" vein.

There is evidently a wide area of this coal between the Kanawha and

Big Sandy Kivers in which it will prove a valuable coking coal.

A bed of excellent fire clay often underlies the Clarion coal both in

Pennsylvania and Ohio, being second in value only to the Kittanning

clay above,'and often rivaling it in thickness.

The interval below the clay down to the next coal bed (Brookville)

varies greatly both in thickness and in the rock material which occu-

pies it. Occasionally the series ends with the Clarion iinderclay, which

rests immediately on top of the next lower or Conglomerate Measures,

while again, shales and a sandstone termed by Chance the Clarion

sandstone occupy this interval, which iii Pennsylvania is geklom lucre

tliau 30 to 50 feet thick.

In Ohio the interval below the Clarion clay down to the top of the Pottsville Measures is seldom more than 150 feet, the same being true in northern West Virginia, as may be seen from Sections 90 and 97.
On the Great Kanawha lliver the interval from the Clarion or Kagle coal down to the top of the Pottsville Measures thickens to nearly 300 feet, and consists of a succession of shales and sandstones, in which occur two thin limestones and two or three thin coal beds. None of the latter attain a thickness of 3 feet, however, anywhere between the Kanawha and Big Sandy Kivers, so that the workable coals of this series in that region really end with the Clarion (Eaglo) bed.
Two or three rocks in this interval of 300 feet in southwestern West Virginia require more particular notice. One of them, and the uppermost, is a very pure seam of coal, which at Eagle comes only I'O feet below the main Eagle bed, and is li feet thick. I have termed it the Little Eagle coal, since it is possibly a "split" from the main bed above. To the south it appears to be quite persistent, since it occurs iu Wyoming County in every section; but the interval separating it from the Eagle bed has there swelled to G.5 feet (Section 117) and the coal has thickened to 27 inches of the same excellent fuel as on the Kauawha.
THE EAGLE LIMESTONE.

Another rock worthy of mention in this Kanawha series is an impure limestone which occurs near Eagle at an interval of 75 feet under the Eagle coal. It is only about I foot thick, quite dark, fossiliferous, and exhibits the "cone-in-eoue" structure to a Wonderful degree, being locally known as " black marble." The stratum is immediately underlaid by dark shales, which are crowded with marine fossils of the same
type as those found in connection with the Ferriferous limestone iu rennsylvania and Ohio; in fact, so many of the species are identical, and the limestone itself so closely resembles the Ferriferous when thin, that sometimes I have been inclined to think that the two beds may possibly be identical, though this would seem to be impossible from the structure of Section 115, iu whicli the whole lower coal series is exposed both above and below this stratum. If it should turn out to be identical with the Ferriferous, however, then the Eagle coal would be the Lower Kittanning, instead of the Clarion, and the Camphell's Creek bed the Middle Kittanning, or Netsonville seam of Ohio, instead of the Lower Kittanning. The reader will understand the difficulty of correlation when he remembers that the lower coal series is less than L'OO feet thick in the Hocking Valley, Ohio, while here, only ll'O miles southward, the same series has swelled out to 1,000 feet.
The fossiliferous type of the limestone and its accompanying fossiliferous shale have never been seen by the writer, except in the vicinity of Eagle, and hence I have preferred to regard it as a local deposit below the horizon of the Ferriferous, since the fossils of the Lower Coal Measures have the same general facies at all horizons.

TUB nliOOKVlLLE COAL.
At the very base of the Lower Coal Measures, except the intervening underclay, there occurs in Jefferson, Clarion, and some other counties of Pennsylvania, a bed of usually slaty and otherwise impure coal, which was long ago named the Urookville bed, from its supposed occurrence near the town of that name in Jefferson County. This coal acquires some local importance around the northern margin of the coal Held in Jefferson, Clarion, Butler, and Mercer Counties, but southward aud westward it thins away and is often absent even as an impure bed, there being no coal whatever at this horizon where the Pennsylvania
ir series enters Ohio; and if I am correct in identifying Prof. Orion's "Brookville" coal, (Vol. V, Ohio Geology) with the Clarion of Pennsylvania, then the Brookville coal is generally absent, or at least seldom workable anywhere in that State. Very frequently the Brookville coal is represented in Pennsylvania by only a bed of black slate or coaly shale, resting on the top of the Conglomerate Measures, aud this is the case in northern West Virginia, there being no workable coal at this horizon anywhere in that State, so far as the writer is aware. Even in the Kanawha field, where this lower portion of the column is *s<> greatly thickened, the largest coal bed referable to the Brookville horizon is the one in the Wyoming County section (117), and this is only 2.J inches. On the Great Kanawha a bed of very bituminous sh.ile (Section 115), from which lubricating oil was ouce manufactured, may possibly represent the Brookville coal horizon, since it is the lowest bituminous stratum in the series there. Below this coal in Pennsylvania, aud resting immediately on the top of the Conglomerate series, there is sometimes a good bed of fire clay, and Mr. Chance refers to this horizon the clay which is mined so extensively iu Clearueld County, at Blue Ball, Wallaceton, aud other points along the line of the Tyrone aud Clearfleld Railroad.

C H A P T E R V I.
THE POTTSVILLE CONGLOMERATE SERIES.
THICKNKSS, CHAUACTElt, AND EXTENT.
Beneath the lowest member of the last described series there comes in a group of rocks (No. XII) which are nearly always so different from those in any other portion of the Carboniferous system that all geologists have regarded them as worthy of being placed in a distinct series. To this series several names' have been given. The early geologists of Pennsylvania called it the " Serai" or "Great" Conglomerate, while in Virginia it has generally been named the No. XII Conglomerate, or simply No. XII. Prof. Lesley has iu recent years, however, given it the geographical designation of Pottsville Conglomerate, from the great development of the series near the town of that name, while 1'rof. Fontaine, following the Pennsylvania custom of naming the several coal series after prominent rivers along which the beds are exposed, has suggested the name New River series, from that region of West Virginia where its coal beds attain a great development.
But since only one geographical name is admissible for the series, and as the term Pottsville is now so well ingrafted upon geological nomenclature through the numerous reports of the Second Geological Survey of Pennsylvania, it is thought best to retain it for the series, and at the same time retain New Ifiver for the name of the coal group which attains such prominence along that stream, thus putting it on a par with the Merger group, which occurs iu the upper portion of the series.
As exhibited everywhere in Pennsylvania and West Virginia, this series is very sharply set off from the Lower Coal Measures above and the Lower Carboniferous below, since in both cases there is a great change iu the lithology, so that the geologist finds no ditliculty in determining where the Pottsville series begins as well as where it ends.
The series as a whole possesses a large amount of hard, white, or grayish white sandstone, much of which is often cougloim-iitic. The sandstones are harder, more compactx and siliceous than auy iu the Lower Coal Series above. Bowlders of these sandstones take a smooth polish when rolled along river beds, but this is not the case with most sandrocks above this horizon.
The fossil contents are also different from those of any sandstones above, since here for the first time iu descending the column of rocks

180

[BDU.M.

do we find sigillariae aud the large lepidodeudra very abundant in sandstones.
At the base of the series the change in lithology and life remains is even more abrupt, since with the disappearance of the white or gray sandstones and conglomerates, limestones, red shales, and green micaceous sandstones appear, in which plant remains are rare aud the fossil trees are all small.
The Pottsville being composed mainly of very hard sandstones, the grains of which are cemented by silica and peroxide of iron, becomes almost indestructible by ordinary atmospheric influences, and has thus proved a most important factor in determining the topography of the Carboniferous system. Whenever these" beds come to the surface iu
West Virginia and Pennsylvania, wild and rugged scenery is sure to be found. Rapid rivers, high waterfalls, great cliff's, and barren regions generally, mark the lines where these rocks emerge to daylight. The loftiest peaks of the Alleghauy Mountains owe their origin to this
friendly mautle, while its upturned edges have preserved many coal basins from complete destruction. The deep gorges, narrow cafions, aud wild scenery of the Alleghauy, Youghioglieny, Cheat, Monongahela, New, Guyandotte, and Big Sandy Rivers are all carved out of these rocks. The Falls of the Yough, Cheat, Tygart's Valley, Kanawha, and the "Roughs" of the Guyaudotte aud Big Sandy are all made by these same beds.
It was formerly supposed that a vast sheet of pebbly material underlaid all of the true Coal Measures, and that it was destitute of coal; but the recent work of the Second Geological Survey of Pennsylvania has shown that the series is very complex, consisting of several distinct sandstone members, between which occur shales, several coal beds, and occasionally some limestone.
In Ohio it happens that the upper members are not so massive as iu Pennsylvania or West Virginia, while the coal beds which are prominent only around the margins are well developed there, so that the Ohio geologists have classed the upper portion with the Lower Coal Measures, and retained only the lowest member of the series, viz, a stratum termed the Sharon Conglomerate, as the representative of the whole series elsewhere. I shall show in the following pages that the whole series is easily recognized in Ohio, and that the western Pennsylvania type of these measures can be traced across Ohio, and hence for the sake of uniformity in nomenclature the Ohio geologists should cut off 100 to 150 feet from the bottom of their Lower Coal Measure column and combine it with the Sharon Conglomerate below, thus making several members for the series instead of a single stratum.
The coals of the Pottsville aeries, unlike those in the measures above, are persistent and valuable only around the margins of the Appalachian coal field, and for the most part only where their outcrops are above the level of the principal draiuage streams, so that the conditions for-

merly supposed to apply to the Lower Coal Measures do actually prevail with reference to the coal in this series, since hundreds of carefully kept well records testify to the absence of any workable coal beds in this series over all except the outer rims of the Appalachian field. This same fact is visible to the eye in passing inward toward the center of the field down any one of the great rivers which drain into the Ohio. The Sharon coal disappears southward along the Shenango and Mahoning rivers long before its horizon dips down to water level; the New Itiver coals fade out of the section before their outcrops touch the stream to the north; the great bed at Pocahontas does not extend indefinitely down the Guyandotte and Tug rivers, but only L'O to :iO miles, until it dwindles away to a bed too thin to mine, so that should a shaft be sunk to these beds 30 or 40 miles from their southern or northern outcrops respectively, the same massive, pebbly, white sandstones would be found, but instead of inclosing valuable coal beds they would hold only thin streaks of coal and some black slates.
Another peculiarity about these interconglomerate coals is the great difference in quality between those around the southern rim of the Appalachian field and those around its northern border, for in western Pennsylvania and across Ohio they are all open burning, hard, and generally known under the name of " block" coals, which can be used in furnaces in the raw state, while to the south, through West Virginia, Virginia, and on into Tennessee and Alabama, these same coals are very soft and tender, always cementing and making good coke. This difference is connected with different conditions of accumulation, there probably being less moisture in the great peat swamps at the north, and the vegetable accumulations taking place not under water, but partially at least in the open air. This much would be indicated by the innumerable films of mineral charcoal which characterize the northern coals and render them non-cementing. To the unequal rate of subsidence on the two sides of the Appalachian basin is doubtless owing the conditions which brought about the difference in the character of the coals.
Another peculiarity is the great purity of these early formed coals, their freedom from injurious quantities of ash and sulphur, both at the north and south. This also appears to be due to the conditions attending their deposition rather than to any difference in vegetable tissues, since just previous to the spread of these early coal marshes the whole Appalachian region was sheeted with a thick layer of clean gravel and white sand, thus effectually covering up the muddy deposits of a former epoch and causing the streams which drained into the peat bogs of that time to be pure and clear like our own mountain brooks of the present.
The thickness of the Pottsville series varies greatly in different portions of the Appalachian basin. In the bituminous regions of Pennsylvania, and everywhere in Ohio, they rarely exceed 300 feet and seldom go below 150; but south westward through West Virginia they begin to swell out, reaching 700 feet at the head of Black Water, iu

This series is .also the repository of much salt water, as well as some

oil and gas. The celebrated brines on the Great Kanawha, as well as

at Pomeroy and many other localities along the OLio Kiver, come in its

basal members, while the "first gas sand" of the Cannonsburg and

Hickory region of Washington County, Pennsylvania, is found in the

upper half of the same. This rock is also gas-bearing near Glover's

Virginia, on the Snodderly farm.

This section exhibits the beginning of the great southeastern thickening of the Pottsville series along the Big Sandy, but we have not sufficient data southward from Blame Creek to traee the rate of increase along the Tug Fork, since even the top of the Pottsville does not rise to daylight on that stream for 100 miles above the mouth Fir,.i48.-Sflction of Blaiue. When the bottom series does finally come to Kl?v'-rn"i1fmoutS the surface at the southern edge of McDowell County, ,,niiaiii,<ci«,k. Wegt virj-inia, it is not less than 1,500 feet thick, and
may possibly be 2,000, since the Kentucky geologists claim the latter thickness for these measures on the headwaters of the Big Sandy.
There is no point along the Tug River in West Virginia where a vertical measurement can be made; hence, if the exact thickness is ever determined it must be by a boring.
The black slates, Nos. 2, 11, and i;{ of the above section, probably represent the intercouglomerate coal beds.

ZOO' The New Kiver coals belong in Nos. -t and 6 of the sect ion, but they here contain no opal whatever, though only -10 miles north from the New Kiver coal lield.
The series has here increased 251) feet in thickness in !> miles, a very rapid rate, and possibly indicating that the great thick ness (5,xo feet) found under Charleston may have been abruptly instead of gradually acquire'l.
In this boring a considerable flow.of natural gas was obtained in the top of the Pocono sandstone, or " l'.ig Injun" oil sand, at a depth of about 1,000 fret. This is the locality where natural gas was first, used for manufacturing purposes in the United States, as
far back as 1841. It was utilized for evaporating salt water. One of the gas wells found here, according to report, displaced for fuel L',000 bushels of coal daily during a period of ten years. The last well, however (bored in 1887), does not produce much over 500,000 cubic feet of gas daily. The most productive wells were situated near the crest of the anticline which crosses the Kanawua Kiver at Uuruiug Spring.

(151), bnt the Pocahontas coal lies iiOO feet nearer the base of the Pottsville series than No. 18 docs on New River, and hence unless this part of the series thins away towards the southwest, which seems improbable, the possibility of identity is rather slender. The mining operations of the next few years, however, may be depended upon to settle the question, since it has a more than scientitic interest.
A cursory examination of the sections given will show that the Pottsville series generally has something like the following structure:

Sandstone (Himipwowl). Coal group (Mercer). Sandstones (Connoi|iicueRsini;). Coal group (New Kivor). Sandnlono (Shiiron).

'

Of course when the series attains such an excessive thickness as on the New lliver, for instance, the structure is more complicated than the above scheme would indicate, and yet even then a general agreement can usually be made out.
Having now glanced at the general structure of these measures, we shall take up the more important members and describe them in detail.

* . CHARACTERISTIC IIOIHZONS.

TIIF. IIOMF.WOOD SANDSTONK.
The Pottsvillo series is nearly everywhere rapped with a coarse sandstone, which is quite different in texture and general appearance from any of the sandstones in the Coal Measures above. In the vicinity of llomewood, Beaver County, Pennsylvania, this rock attains a thickness of 150 feet, and was named from that locality. It is generally quite massive, making great dirt's along the streams and covering the summits with huge blocks arranged in "rock cities." While usually quite hard, it generally splits well and makes excellent building stone, the blocks from it being almost indestructible. Although generally of a yellowish or bullish gray til ge, it occasionally consists of almost pure white quart/ grains, and hence sometimes supplies glass sand of excellent quality. This might be called the " cascade" member of I he Pottsville series, since it so often produces water-falls.
In Pennsylvania it is generally 30 to 50 feet thick, but occasionally, as at llomewood and other points, it thickens up to 75 or even 150 feet.
Westward, in Ohio, the rock thins down and is often only 15 to L'O feet thick, but still distinctly recognizable as a heavy bedded, coarse sandstone, filled with fossil stems and trunks of trees, mostly lepido dendron and sigillaria. It is seen in the bed of Little P.eaver near its mouth, and frequently between that point and Fiedericktown. It is the quarry rock in Coshoctou County referred to in Vol. V (p. 101), < >hio Geology, where it is 30 feet thick and of the. same type so often found in Pennsylvania. From this point on across Ohio, to Ironton and

i UK NORTHERN BITUMINOUS COAL FIELD.

fBI'M.. fi"..

Hanging Hock, it is frequently seen, and at the latter point makes one

of the great dill's in the steep hillside which gave name to the place,

being there 40 feet thick.

Along the Great Kanawha this rock comes to water level at the

month of Armstrong Creek, and from there on up that stream, as well

us up the New and Gaiiley rivers, is a great cliff rock 150 to L'OO feet

thick. It crowns the walls of the New Itiver cailon at Hawk's Nest

and oilier points to Nuttallbnrg and beyond, where it seems to change

suddenly in character southward from that, becoming soft and easily

disintegrating to a heap of coarse, brown sand.

On the Tug fork of Big Sandy this stratum makes great, dill's along

the hills through the "roughs" of Tug, and sinks below that stream at

the mouth of Hen's ('reek, !)5 miles above Louisa.

Ohio Pyle Falls, on the Yonghiogheuy Itiver, is made by this rock,

and Hie upper portions of the great cascades ou the Black Water and

(ilady forks of Cheat pour over the same stratum..

II, is the gas-bearing member in western Pennsylvania and northern

West Virginia.

TIIK MKCCKI: (ii:onr.

In western Pennsylvania a group of coals associated with two fossiliferous limestones makes its appearance directly under the llomcwood sandstone, ami extends almost uninterruptedly across the Ohio Held to Hanging Uock. It was lirst fully described from the vicinity of Mercer, Pennsylvania, and named from that locality. When well developed the group presents the succession seen in Section NO, and is HI to 50 feet thick.
The two limestones are veiy much alike, except the Lower Mercer is a little darker blue than the Upper, and is the more persistent. Both are crowded with fossils and are frequently cherry, some of the famous " flint ledges" of Ohio being made by one of these beds. Kaeh limestone usually carries an iron ore on its top of the variety known as " block''ore. The Upper Mercer is known as the /oar limestone in many portions of Ohio, and its ore is called by several terms, among which are "Dunkel P.lock," " I'Vanklin Block." "Main Block," " Big L'ed Block," etc. The Lower Mercer was formerly known as the "Bine" limestone, and its corresponding ore as the "Bine Limestone Block," "Little Block,"etc.
The Mercer coals are generally two, the upper one coming under UM> Upper Mercer limestone and the lower one under the Lower Mercer limestone. Occasionally there is also a coal on top of each limestone, but these beds are sporadic, and hence do not merit a designation, though Orion has applied the inline "Tioncsta" to the upper one in Ohio, as the writer did in Ifeport Q2, on Lawrence County, Pennsylvania.
These Mercer coals are generally rich in ash, and are seldom mined on a commercial scale, although they are quite persistent from western

WIIITR.I

THE CONNOQUENESSINO SANDSTONF.S.

Pennsylvania all around the northern margin of the Ohio coal field, lioth of them occasionally become cannel in Ohio, (he upper being the Strawbridge cannel of llolmes (bounty and the lied ford cannel of Coshocton, according to Orton, while the lower coal is the Flint Ridge cannel of Licking County. Neither of these beds seldom exceeds :? feet in thickness, and they are more frequently only 1 or 'J.
Eastward from Mercer and Lawrence Counties, Pennsylvania, the limestones disappear from this group and the coals thin away, except around the northern rim of the coal field, where, in MeKcan r.unity, the Alton coal group of Ashhurner probably represents the Mercer coals, so that usually only one is left, and it is generally unite impure. This bed has received a different name for nearly every locality where it, attains workable thickness. Rogers called it the Tionesta coal in Forest County, Pennsylvania, and it is (he Mount Savage bed of Somerset. Along the north Potomac River it frequently appears in the cuts of the West Virginia Central Railroad, and is there known as the " Railroad seam." It has been mined for local use just above Valley Falls, Taylor County, West Virginia, where it lies near water level, and is 1 feet thick, with a slate near center. It always presents a coarse structure, and no first-class fuel is ever obtained at this hori/.mi. Along tint New Hiver, and through all the country between it and the Tug Fork, only an insignificant coal, 1 to- feet thick, occurs at this level.
The famous Mount Savage lire day of Pennsylvania and Mar.vland comes within the limits of the Mercer group, and directly underlies the Mount, Savage coal, which it occasionally replaces.

Till'. OONNoijI KM SSINii SAXI'STONPS.
1'elow the Mercer group there comes the great sandstone hori/on par excellence of the Pottsville series. This group is generally triple, there being a massive sandstone at top, then a coal and shale interval, below which is another massive sandstone. These sandstones were first studied by the writer along the Connoqiienessing River, in Lawrence County, Pennsylvania, and they were designated from that stream. The Massillon sandstone of Newberry represents only a portion of the group; otherwise it would have precedence in nomenclature.
Kadi of these sandstone members is from HI to ."ill feet thick, though occasionally the. shale and coal separating them thins out and llie\ coalesce into one mass 15(1 to 'JOO feet thick, or even more. They aie generally quite hard, the quart/ grains being liner and more compact ly arranged-than ill the llomewood sandstone above. The color is more frequently yellowish white than any other, though sometimes it is gray.
The, (juakertown coal comes between the (wo sandstone members of the group. It seldom exceeds L' feet in western Pennsylvania or east ern Ohio, and unless it should be the ".Jackson shaft," or ' \\YIUton" coal, it does not seem to attain much importance in (hat State, though it is often present in the series as a thin bed, being represented in the

Ifanging Rock section (147) by number 13, which is only 2 feet thick, slate and .ill.
East from the Mahoning River no workable coal is known at this horizon in Pennsylvania, though a thin coal or block slate is often present.
THE SEW RIVKR COAL GROUP.
The great development of coal in the middle and lower half of the I'ottsville series along New River, West Virginia, has given name to this group. Although there are thin representatives of the group in nearly every section of the I'ottsvillo which is exposed in Pennsylvania, yet only around the northwestern margin of the, Held in that State is any valuable coal found at this horizon, namely, the Sharon coal of Mereer County. This bed ocenrs in pockets and isolated basins, in the western part of Mercer, where it is .3 to 5 feet thick, and a " block," or open-burning coal of great purity. It enters Ohio in the same patchy condition, and extends through Mahoning, Trmnhiill, Portage, Summit, Stark, Medina., and Wayno Counties of northeastern Ohio, and it is probably tho "Jackson shaft" or ' Wellston" seam of Jackson County in southern Ohio. In all cases it is the same open-burning, pure fuel, very low in ash and sulphur.
This Sharon bed and its thin rider appear to represent all the coals in the New River group, and hence it can not be called identical with any one of them, though according to Prof. Fontaine the flora of the Sharon roof shales is very similar to that found in the roof of the Qiiiiiniinont bed on New River. These roof shales of the Sharon coal through western Pennsylvania and across Ohio arc a very characteristic; feature. They begin directly under tho Connoqueiiessing sandstoues, and are often 40 to fiO feet thick, of a dark bine color, and generally contain much iron ore (carbonate) in nuggets and bands. These shales show the same character at Hanging Rock (Section 147), in southern Ohio, as they do on the Mahoning at the east.
In passing southward from Pennsylvania, along the Alleghany Mountain region, one of these New River beds thickens up to 3 feet in Garrett County, Maryland, just east from the West Virginia line, and has there been mined for local use on the land of Mr. Hrowning. It comes near the base of the Pottsvillc series, is quite soft and pure, and exhibits the same coking type as these coals all do on New River. One of these beds is also workable along Shaver's Fork of Cheat River, east from the Hcvorly Valley. This coal group, which is well shown in the Hlack Water section (133) of Tucker County, grows in importance south westward through Randolph, Webster, Greenbrier and Nicholas Counties, into Fayetto, where at Nuttallbnrg on New River we find the type section of the group (No. lf>l), which there incloses three workable coal beds besides several too thin to be of economic importance. The three workable beds are, in descending order, the Nuttall, Fire Creek, and Qninnimont, with tho intervals separating them shown in Section 151.

These coals vary from 3 to 5 feet in thickness along New River, and

are the ones from which the celebrated New River coke is now manu-

factured. The Nuttall is the most regular and persistent, being the

only one which dips below water level at the north with a workable

thickness.

They are .all quite soft, very low in ash and sulphur, and rich in fixed

carbon, making coke of the greatest purity.

The Fire Creek and Quinniinout beds are quite irregular in their dis-

tribution and thickness, but both of them furnish much good coal on

New River. I have termed the lowest bed the Quinnimont. but the

stratigraphical horizon of the Qninnimont seam is not yet settled since

it may prove identical with the Fire Creek bed, but all the coal oper-

ators agree that there are three workable coals on New River, and that!

Nos. 11, 1C, and 18 of Section li»l are these three beds, whatever their

identity with reference to the Fire Creek and Quinnimont localities

may be.

Southwestward from Fayette County towards Raleigh, Mercer, and

McDowell, the New River coals still continue, to increase in thickness

and importance, culminating in the great bed at Pocahontas, in the edge

of Virginia.

This coal was numbered III in the, original section published from Pocahnntas by Alaj. .led. llotchkiss, and it, is frei|iie,nM.v known by that
II name. Major llotchkiss thinks I lie I'ocahontas bed identical with the (^iiinnimont of New River, but, the writer can not, yet satisfactorily correlate this bed with any of the New Hiver coals which have been mined. The coal from the I'ocahontas seam is <|iiite as pure and valuable for coke, and general fuel purposes as any in the New Kiver lield, and, in fact, is the same kind ol'eo;il. Two other beds of I to 5 feet in thickness occur in the hills above the Pocahontas vein, but so far they have not Iwen mined to any extent, as they are not, regular in thickness and the great bed below monopolizes the present mining operations.

TIIK SIIARON rOXfiMIMKIMTK.
The, interval below the Sliaron coal in Ohio and western Pennsylvania down to the base of the Pottsville series is often occupied by a massive conglomerate, and when it is absent the coal with its under clay rests directly on the Lower Carboniferous beds. This conglomerate stratum was considered a separate member of the series by the Ohio geologists and as representing the entire No. X 1 1 conglomerate of Hogers in Pennsylvania'.
Hut later studies have shown that it is simply the basal member of this series. When well developed in Ohio it is very coarse, being a mere mass of pebbles from a pea, to an egg in sixe. There is no single stratum around the southeastern margin of the Appalachian lield that will exactly compare with the Sliaron conglomerate in physical aspect, though local streaks in all these great sandstones are (piite as pebbly, but just as the Sliaron coal is represented by several beds in the New Hiver section, so the Sliaron conglomerate, only 20 to 40 feet thick in

WHITR.J

TMK 1,0 WKK CAKliONU'KKOUS.

Pennsylvania and Ohio, is on New Kiver represented by .'500 to 100 feet ot'sliales, sandstones, and conglomerates.
In northern Pennsylvania the Olcan conglomerateof Ilradford County and the (iarland conglomerate of Warren have been shown by Mr. John I1'. Carll to be identical with tlie Sharon stratum, and they also iesen:lile it very much in physical characters. The coarse type of the Sharon conglomerate appears, to be confined to the northwestern rim <>l the Appalachian field, since it disappears southward uuder the other members oi' the series.
TUB l.OWKK CAIillOMKKIEors T.KI'S.

Below the base of the I'ottsville series come the red .shales am! limestones of the Manch Chunk series, and then succeed the gray sandstones of the 1'ocono, the lowest sei ics of the Carboniferous system.
Thin coals occur locally in both of these members of the Lower Carboniferous in Pennsylvania and West Virginia, but nowhere i'n these States, nor in Ohio, does any merchantable bituminous coal exist in this portion of the Carboniferous.
The Tipton Hun coals of Ulair Comity, Pennsylvania, have been eileil as occurring in the I'ocono sandstone scries for the last thirty-live years, and this conclusion is reiterated by Mr. Ashburncr in a special lepoit made as late as 1,S.S.""> (Pennsylvania (ieological Survey, Annual Kcporl, 1885, p. -50), but a single glance at the fossil plants occurring in the roof shales of the coals now mined there proves that they belong in the Lower Coal Measures, or Allegliany Kiver series, and not to the Pocono, their apparent stratigraphical position being the result of displacement, so that although the Pocono series is reported to contain valuable coal beds in Montgomery County, Virginia, it certainly docs not in any of
the three States covered l>y this report, and hence a further consideration of the Lower Carboniferous beds is not germane to this publica-
tion.
