U. S. Geological Survey
A geologic map and recent drilling data of the Sinsinawa River area, Grant County, Wisconsin, are now available for examination.
The geologic mapping and exploratory drilling in this area are part of the cooperative investigations of the zinc-lead district "by the Geological Survey and the Wisconsin Geological sjcid Natural History Survey, The data complement previous mapping of the Hazel G-reen-Shullsburg area and area east of Cuba City, and the interpretations of the data indicate that possible ore-bearing synclinal structures extend westward into the Sinsinawa River area.
Most of the geology of the Sinsinawa Hiver area x^as maTroed during 1950-51 by John W. Allingham, Arthur E. Flint, and Alien F. Agnew in order to appraise more adequately the potentialities of the area for zinc and lead exploration. The map shows areal geology and geologic structure interpreted from outcrop and drill-hole data *nd p.lso shov/s lead diggings and zinc-lead workings.

Areas that contain few outcrops, and from which little subsurface information was available, were drilled during the latter part of 1951 and early part of 1952. The Maquoketa, Galena, Decorah, and PJ.atteville formations were penetrated "by this drilling, and the descriptions of lithology and evidences of mineralization in these strata are "based upon the study of samples from 18 churn-drill holes totaling 2,367 feet. These data also were used in compilation of the map.
The geologic map and drilling data of the Sinsinawa River area are on file and may "be examined at the Geological Survey: Room 1033 (Library), General Services Administration Building, Washington, D. C., and Room 108, Wisconsin Institute of Technology, Platteville, Wis.; and at the Wisconsin Geological and Natural History Survey, Room 115, Science Hall, University of Wisconsin, Madison, Wig.
The map and an accompanying short report will "be published later as a Field Study in the Mineral Investigations Series.
