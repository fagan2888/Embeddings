Lithostratigraphy, Microlithofacies, and Conodont Biostratigraphy and Biofacies of the Wahoo Limestone (Carboniferous),
Eastern Sadlerochit Mountains, Northeast Brooks Range, Alaska
By Andrea P. Krumhardt, 1 Anita G. Harris,2 and Keith F. Watts3

ABSTRACT
The Lisburne Group (chiefly Carboniferous) is a widespread succession of platform carbonate rocks that apparently developed along a south-facing passive continental margin in northern Alaska. Marine transgressions onlapped northward across northeast Alaska allowing the Lisburne platform to extend over terrigenous deposits of the Endicott Group and local pre-Mississippian paleotopographic highs. The Wahoo Limestone is the youngest formation of the Lisburne Group in northeasternmost Alaska, ranging from latest Mississippian (latest Chesterian) to Middle Pennsylvanian (at least early Atokan) in age. The Wahoo Limestone was systematically sampled for lithostratigraphy and conodont biostratigraphy and biofacies at a relatively continuous section (about 262 m in thickness) in the eastern Sadlerochit Mountains.
Existing Carboniferous conodont zonations could not be readily applied to the study section because most zonal indicators are absent. Species diversity is low for a section that spans at least 10 million years. Twenty-four species, distributed among 14 genera, were identified in 72 productive samples; no new species were distinguished. The following biostratigraphic zones and faunal intervals were recognized: Upper muricatus Subzone (latest Chesterian); noduliferus-primus Zone (earliest Morrowan); minutus Fauna (Morrowan) containing a lower subdivision (lower minutus Fauna of early to middle? Morrowan age); and an Idiognathodus Fauna (Morrowan? to early Atokan). The presence of Idiognathodus incurvusl and Rhachistognathus minutus subspp. above the first occurrence of the foraminifer Pseudostaffella sp. in the uppermost part of the Wahoo Limestone indicates that the youngest beds are early Atokan in age. The Mississippian-Pennsylvanian boundary is

placed at 56 m above the base of the lower member of the Wahoo Limestone on the basis of the lowest occurrence of Declinognathodus noduliferus japonicus above forms transitional from Gnathodus girtyi simplex.
Established foraminiferan biostratigraphy is somewhat inconsistent with respect to conodont-based time-rock boundaries and conodont zones in the study section and in northern Alaska in general. This indicates that the standard foraminiferan and (or) conodont zonations are not locally applicable without modification.
Conodont collections from the Wahoo Limestone across the northeast Brooks Range (from Wahoo Lake to the Clarence River) show remarkably similar faunal successions but even less species diversity than that found in the study section. Fifty-six biostratigraphically significant collections documenting the distribution of faunal units recognized in the study section are described in appendix 1.
The Wahoo Limestone formed in a range of chiefly open-platform, near-shoal, and open-marine environments on the shallow, inner part of a high-energy carbonate ramp. In the uppermost Mississippian and lowermost Pennsylvanian part of the formation, shoal facies were uncommon so that open-platform and open-marine microlithofacies and conodont biofacies were not clearly separated. Grain types and, to a lesser extent, conodonts were hydraulically spread beyond their original settings making some paleoenvironmental interpretations equivocal. The use of conodont biofacies and microlithofacies in concert clarifies some of the environmental ambiguities. In the Pennsylvanian part of the Wahoo Limestone, extensive ooid and skeletal shoal tracts separated open-marine and open-platform environments producing more distinct biofacies and diagnostic microlithofacies. Rhachistognathids thrived in and adjacent to the shoal facies. After death, many of their skeletal elements remained in place; however, a substantial number were washed into surrounding environments, masking natural species associations. Similarly, mixing of carbonate grains obscures microlithofacies interpretations. The vertical succession of conodont biofacies substantiates microlithofacies interpretations that indicate that the upper part of the Wahoo

CONODONT BIOSTRATIGRAPHY AND BIOFACIES OF THE WAHOO LIMESTONE

Limestone represents a transgressive-regressive sequence passing from restricted platform to shoals and, finally, back to restricted platform. Conodont species associations, abraded conodonts and bioclasts, and grain-type associations indicate a high degree of postmortem hydraulic mixing across the carbonate platform supporting the interpretation that it represents a high-energy carbonate ramp.
Conodont color alteration indices (CAI) in the study section are chiefly 4 and 6, rarely 3, and very rarely 3.5 and 4.5. Most conodont elements have a sugary and (or) corroded texture. The anomalously high CAI values of 6 have positive correlation with grainstones and dolomitized intervals and negative correlation with quartz-rich and poorly washed carbonate rocks. The range of CAI values and textures and the distribution of high CAI values suggest local, probably low-temperature hydrothermal alteration of the Wahoo Limestone.
INTRODUCTION
The Lisburne Group (chiefly Carboniferous) is a thick sequence of predominantly carbonate rocks that extends across the Brooks Range and into the subsurface of the North Slope (fig. 1). In the northeast Brooks Range, the Lisburne Group is at least 500 m thick and is subdivided into the Alapah Limestone and overlying Wahoo Limestone. The northeast Brooks Range is the area east of the Trans-Alaska Pipeline and north of the Continental Divide, which trends east-northeast between lat 68° and 69° N. and long 139° to 147° W.
The Wahoo Limestone in the eastern Sadlerochit Mountains, Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR), was measured and systematically sampled for conodonts, foraminifers, and microlithofacies (figs. 1, 2). The study section is well exposed, contains some of the youngest beds of the Wahoo Limestone in the area, and is similar to the Wahoo Limestone in the subsurface at Prudhoe Bay (Reiser, 1970; Armstrong and Mamet, 1974). It is accessible from Kaktovik, a major embarkation point for ANWR (fig. 1).
This study was undertaken to (1) establish a conodont biostratigraphic framework for the Wahoo Limestone in ANWR, (2) determine the position of the MississippianPennsylvanian boundary in the formation, (3) integrate conodont biofacies with microlithofacies studies (for example, Armstrong, 1972; Armstrong and Mamet, 1977; Watts, 1990; Gruzlovic, 1991; Krumhardt, 1992), and (4) compare conodont and foraminiferan biostratigraphic data. Previously, foraminifers provided the primary biostratigraphic control for the Lisburne Group in ANWR. Inconsistent assignment of foraminiferan zones and lithologic boundaries by previous researchers in our study area, however, indicates unresolved stratigraphic problems (see fig. 8). More recently, conodonts have been used to refine, confirm, or as an alternative to foraminiferan age determinations (>500 conodont collections from the Lisburne Group were

analyzed by A.G. Harris from 1979 to 1994 and by Harris and A.P Krumhardt from 1989 to 1994; published and unpublished written communs.). Many of these samples indicate that conodonts have greater biostratigraphic resolution than foraminifers in the uppermost Mississippian and Lower Pennsylvanian part of the Lisburne Group. In addition, the conodont Declinognathodus noduliferus is the primary micropaleontologic indicator for the base of the Pennsylvanian (Lane and Manger, 1985). Thus, conodonts are the preferred microfossils for locating the midCarboniferous (Mississippian-Pennsylvanian) boundary.

measured sections and providing us with microlithofacies analyses of their samples. We are most grateful to J.A. Dumoulin, U.S. Geological Survey; P.H. von Bitter, Royal Ontario Museum and University of Toronto; L.M. Brown, Lake Superior State University; and G.D. Webster, Washington State University for their heroic, timely, and thorough reviews of the manuscript. This paper was considerably improved by their technical reviews.
PREVIOUS STUDIES
Schrader (1902, p. 241) first used the name "Lisburne formation" for limestone and shale exposed in the vicinity of Anaktuvuk Pass in the central Brooks Range (fig. 1). The regional extent and character of the formation were more fully described by him in a later paper in which he states that the Lisburne extends from Cape Lisburne to Anaktuvuk Pass and eastward "nearly to the international boundary and

probably beyond it" (Schrader, 1904, p. 67). Subsequently, in the central Brooks Range, Bowsher and Dutro (1957) raised the Lisburne to group rank and subdivided it into two new formations, the Wachsmuth Limestone and overlying Alapah Limestone. Brosge and others (1962) distinguished a third and the youngest formation of the group, the Wahoo Limestone, in the eastern Brooks Range.
Detailed regional biostratigraphic and microlithofacies analyses of the Lisburne Group accompanied the expansion of hydrocarbon exploration of the North Slope during the 1970's. Armstrong and others (1970) first applied Mamet's Carboniferous foraminiferan zonation to the Lisburne Group in the northeast Brooks Range, and, later, Armstrong (1972) described the carbonate lithology, coral biostratigraphy, and paleoecology. Mamet and Armstrong (1972) examined sections in the Franklin and Romanzof Mountains (fig. 1) and later Armstrong and Mamet (1974) tied the Lisburne Group in the subsurface at Prudhoe Bay to exposures in ANWR. Wood and Armstrong (1975) described the

REGIONAL GEOLOGIC SETTING

diagenesis and stratigraphy of the Lisburne Group in the Sadlerochit Mountains and adjacent areas while Armstrong and Mamet (1975) extended their biostratigraphic studies to other sections in the northeast Brooks Range. Ultimately, Armstrong and Mamet (1977) produced a regional synthesis of their investigations for the entire northern Brooks Range. Armstrong and Mamet (1978) extended their work to the Lisburne Group in the allochthonous thrust sheets in the central and western Brooks Range. Mamet and Armstrong (1984) discussed the Mississippian-Pennsylvanian boundary in the Sadlerochit, Franklin, and Romanzof Mountains and placed the boundary at the contact between the Alapah and Wahoo Limestones. A revised megafossil zonation for the Carboniferous of the northern Brooks Range and its relation to Mamet's foraminiferan zonation is given in Dutro (1987). As in Mamet and Armstrong (1984), Dutro (1987) placed the Mississippian-Pennsylvanian boundary at the contact between the Alapah and Wahoo Limestones.
Since 1985, many reports have been produced on the geology of ANWR by investigators at the University of Alaska Fairbanks (for example, Crowder, 1990; Wallace and Hanks, 1990; Watts, 1990). Of particular importance to our study are reports on the depositional environments, cyclicity, and diagenetic history of the Wahoo Limestone in the eastern Sadlerochit Mountains and the stratigraphic evolution and lateral facies changes of carbonate cycles (parasequences) across the Lisburne Group carbonate platform (fig. 2; Carlson, 1987; Gruzlovic, 1991). Additional studies describing the geology of ANWR are included in Bird and Magoon (1987), Tailleur and Weimer (1987), and Grantz and others (1990).
REGIONAL GEOLOGIC SETTING
The parautochthonous rocks of northeastern Alaska are part of the tectonically complex Arctic Alaska terrane that also includes allochthonous thrust sheets of the southern Brooks Range and the relatively little deformed autochthonous rocks beneath the North Slope (fig. 1; Reiser, 1970; Mull, 1982; Crowder, 1990). The rocks in the Arctic Alaska terrane have been subdivided into the Franklinian, Ellesmerian, and Brookian tectono-depositional sequences (fig. 3; Grantz and May, 1983; Bird and Molenaar, 1987; Hubbard and others, 1987) using terminology established by Lerand (1973) in the Canadian Arctic.
The Franklinian sequence in the northeast Brooks Range includes Precambrian to Devonian sedimentary, metamorphic, and igneous rocks. Erosion of these rocks following orogenic uplift during the middle Paleozoic produced a paleotopography that considerably influenced subsequent depositional patterns and structural deformation (Watts and others, 1988; Wallace and Hanks, 1990).

Mississippian to Lower Cretaceous sedimentary rocks of the Ellesmerian sequence unconformably overlie the Franklinian sequence (fig. 3). The Ellesmerian sequence documents a long interval of sedimentation from a northerly source onto a broadly subsiding, passive continental margin. In the Carboniferous part of the sequence, terrigenous clastic sedimentary deposits of the Endicott Group (Mississippian in age in the Sadlerochit Mountains) are succeeded by carbonate-platform deposits of the Lisburne Group. A major unconformity with a hiatus of about 40 m.y. separates the Lisburne Group from the overlying terrigenous clastic deposits of the Sadlerochit Group (Permian and Triassic) (Crowder, 1990). The upper part of the Ellesmerian sequence (Triassic to Lower Cretaceous) is dominated by terrigenous shale of the Kingak Shale (primarily Jurassic) with lesser amounts of sandstone and rare phosphatic limestone and calcareous sandstone to siltstone of the Shublik Formation (Triassic). This report concerns the Carboniferous part of the Ellesmerian sequence.
LISBURNE GROUP, NORTHEAST BROOKS RANGE
The Lisburne Group (chiefly Carboniferous) is a thick succession (>500 m) of platform-carbonate rocks that apparently developed along a south-facing passive continental margin in northern Alaska (relative to present coordinates). Marine transgressions onlapped northward across northeast Alaska so that eventually the Lisburne platform extended over much of Arctic Alaska. In most of the northeast Brooks Range, the Lisburne Group gradationally overlies the fluvial to marginal-marine deposits of the Endicott Group (fig. 4). In the Sadlerochit Mountains, however, the pre-Mississippian rocks formed a paleotopographic high so that the Endicott Group is thin or absent (Armstrong and Mamet, 1975; Watts and others, 1988). Where the Endicott Group is absent, the Lisburne Group rests with angular discordance on southward-dipping, pre-Mississippian rocks (fig. 5); this relationship influenced the structural development of northeastern Alaska (Wallace and Hanks, 1990). South of the Sadlerochit Mountains, the Kayak Shale of the Endicott Group provides a major detachment surface. Because the Kayak Shale is absent or thin in the Sadlerochit Mountains, Ellesmerian rocks (fig. 3) remained attached to the underlying Franklinian rocks, and both deformed as a unit (Wallace and Hanks, 1990). Thus, the Lisburne Group here is parautochthonous and has undergone little northward tectonic transport.
In the northeast Brooks Range, the Lisburne Group consists of the Alapah Limestone and Wahoo Limestone. Three large-scale transgressive-regressive (TR) sequences are recognized in these strata (fig. 4; Gruzlovic, 1991). Superimposed on these large-scale sequences are many parasequences of variable thickness that record the response

of the platform to eustacy and (or) changes in carbonate production and platform subsidence (fig. 4: Watts, 1990; Gruzlovic, 1991). The Endicott Group (where present) and the Alapah Limestone represent the first large-scale TR sequence. The remaining TR sequences generally correspond to the lower and upper members of the Wahoo Limestone.
ALAPAH LIMESTONE
The age of the Alapah Limestone (-200 to >500 m in thickness) is Meramecian and (or) Chesterian on the basis of foraminiferan (Armstrong and others, 1970; Armstrong and Mamet, 1977) and conodont biostratigraphy (this report). In the Sadlerochit Mountains, Alapah deposition began in the Chesterian (Mamet and Armstrong, 1984). The age of the base of the Lisburne Group is progressively older southward and westward. In the northern part of the northeast Brooks Range, continued transgression during much of the deposition of the Alapah Limestone is indicated by a transition from algal limestone into cross-stratified skeletal grainstone culminating in bryozoan-pelmatozoan limestone. The upper member of the Alapah Limestone is dominantly spiculitic dolostone and dolomitic lime mudstonewackestone containing lesser amounts of cryptalgal laminite (fig. 4: Watts, 1990; Gruzlovic, 1991) indicating restricted and (or) peritidal conditions associated with a major regression. The uppermost part of the Alapah Limestone is late Chesterian in age (Armstrong and Mamet, 1977; this report). The contact with the overlying Wahoo Limestone is relatively sharp in the study area but is more gradational and difficult to define farther to the south.
ALAPAH LIMESTONE-WAHOO LIMESTONE BOUNDARY, NORTHEAST BROOKS RANGE
The base of the Wahoo Limestone is placed at the first light-weathering, cliff-forming, fossiliferous limestone above the slope-forming, darker limestone and dolostone characteristic of the underlying Alapah Limestone (fig. 5). A similar contact was chosen by Brosge and others (1962), Armstrong (1972, 1974), Wood and Armstrong (1975), and Carlson (1987). Other authors were inconsistent in their placement of the contact (see fig. 8) and used biostratigraphic rather than lithostratigraphic criteria so that their contact approximated the Mississippian-Pennsylvanian boundary (Armstrong and others, 1970; Armstrong and Mamet, 1974, 1975, and 1977; and Mamet and Armstrong, 1984).
WAHOO LIMESTONE
The age of the Wahoo Limestone (0 to >350 m in thickness) is late Chesterian to Atokan on the basis of fora-

minifers (Armstrong, 1972, 1974; Wood and Armstrong, 1975; Carlson, 1987) and conodont biostratigraphy (this report). Brosge and others (1962) named the Wahoo Limestone and subdivided it into lower and upper members at its type section near Wahoo Lake (fig. 1). They assigned the formation a Pennsylvanian(?) and Permian age on the basis of brachiopod-bryozoan assemblages in the basal part of the lower member and brachiopods in the uppermost part of the upper member. Our conodont collections from the formation, 1.5 km west of the type section, show that the lower member is within the late Chesterian muricatus Zone at its base, and the appearance of Adetognathus lautus 15 m higher indicates the Upper muricatus Subzone (app. 1, Iocs. 4Ala, b). The first definitive Pennsylvanian strata are marked by the appearance of Declinognathodus noduliferus, the guide to the Pennsylvanian, at 155 m above the base of the lower member (app. 1, loc. 4Ald). The youngest bona fide Wahoo Limestone at the type locality is Morrowan to early Atokan in age (Watts and others, 1992; app. 1, loc. 4E). At its type locality, Watts and others (1989) referred the calcareous beds of Permian age to the Echooka Formation in their examination of the upper member of the Wahoo Limestone. A collection from 4.5 m below the top of the formation, about 5 km west of the type section, helps constrain the age of the uppermost beds to the late Morrowan or early Atokan (app. 1, loc. 4D).
Grainstone makes up two-thirds of the Wahoo Limestone at the study section indicating deposition under dominantly high-energy conditions. We recognize two mappable members of the Wahoo Limestone: light-gray, massive, cliff-forming grainstone and packstone of the lower member overlain by the heterolithic upper member that forms ledge-and-slope topography. The lower member represents a large-scale TR sequence (fig. 4) consisting primarily of bryozoan-pelmatozoan grainstone and packstone that probably formed in an open-marine environment. Four to five parasequences (each 10-20 m in thickness) are recognized within the lower member (fig. 4; Carlson, 1987; Watts, 1990; Gruzlovic, 1991); these probably formed in slightly deeper water than those of the upper member. Parasequences in the lower member are more difficult to distinguish in the field because they lack the marked lithologic contrasts characteristic of the upper member; parasequences of the lower member are best recognized by microlithofacies analysis.
In the eastern Sadlerochit Mountains, the contact between the lower and upper members of the Wahoo Limestone appears to be planar but locally has erosional relief (Carlson, 1987; Krumhardt and Harris, 1990). Farther to the southwest, in the Fourth Range and at Plunge Creek (fig. 2), this contact is gradational (Gruzlovic, 1991).
Most of the upper member of the Wahoo Limestone represents a TR sequence containing many parasequences (each 3-9 m thick) related to relative sea-level changes and the migration of ooid shoals. The ooid shoals formed a

Figure 4. Stratigraphic relationships, lithologies, and inferred depositional environments of the Lisburne Group, northeast Brooks Range. At the study section, the Endicott Group is absent, and the Alapah Limestone rests with angular discordance on

pre-Mississippian rocks (fig. 5). Only the Wahoo Limestone was systematically analyzed for this study. See fig. 3 for explanation. (Modified from Carlson, 1987; Watts, 1990; and Gruzlovie, 1991.)

L0wli MEMBER OF THE 3*-;

Figure 5. View of study section looking northeast, eastern Sadlerochit Mountains (see fig. 2 for location). Measured section follows ridgeline and includes upper 3 m of the Alapah Limestone, the entire Wahoo Limestone, and lower 1 m of the Echooka Formation. Note that the Endicott Group is absent and a marked angular unconformity separates the Alapah from underlying pre-Mississippian rocks.

broad, discontinuous belt trending westward from the northern British Mountains, near the Canadian border, to the Canning River and then possibly northwestward toward Prudhoe Bay (fig. 1). The shoals pinch out southwestward, down the depositional dip of the carbonate ramp (Gruzlovic, 1991). The lithology of the upper member varies vertically and laterally as a consequence of ooid shoal migration through time (Carlson, 1987; Watts, 1990; Gruzlovic, 1991).
A disconformity of considerable magnitude (-40 m.y.) separates the Lisburne Group from the overlying Echooka Formation of Permian age (fig. 4). Regionally, this disconformity is an irregular surface having as much as 200 m of section removed by erosion locally and as much as 20 m of local erosional relief (Crowder, 1990). The contact between the Lisburne Group and Echooka Formation is typically planar; carbonate rocks of the Lisburne Group are overlain by terrigenous siltstone, shale, and (or) glauconitic quartzose sandstone of the Echooka Formation (Crowder, 1990). Locally, erosional relief is most apparent beneath channelized conglomerates in the basal part of the Echooka Formation. Clasts in the conglomerates include limestone and chert derived from the Lisburne Group providing additional

evidence of erosion. Even though the Lisburne Group platform was subaerially exposed, karst features are rare (Carlson, 1990; Watts, 1990; Watts and others, 1992). Erosion along the disconformity produced some of the variation in thickness of the Wahoo Limestone and significantly influenced the age of the uppermost part of the formation. At the study section, the formation is not as thick as at the type section (262 m versus >330 m in thickness), but the uppermost part of the formation is as young as or younger than the highest beds at and near the type section (app. 1, Iocs. 4E, D). In some areas, such as near the Trans-Alaska Pipeline (fig. 1), the upper part of the Lisburne Group is no younger than latest Mississippian (Watts, 1991).
LITHOSTRATIGRAPHY OF THE WAHOO LIMESTONE, EASTERN SADLEROCHIT MOUNTAINS
The study section is near the eastern limit of outcrops of the Wahoo Limestone in the Sadlerochit Mountains (fig. 2). The base of the section is in the SE1/4SW1/4 sec. 5, T. 3 N., R. 31 E. (lat 69°38'24" N., long 144°34'45" W), and the

top is in the center NW1/4 sec. 8, T. 3 N., R. 31 E. (lat 69°38'03" N., long 144°34'45" W.), Mt. Michelson C-l quadrangle. This section was chosen because of (1) accessibility by helicopter (65 km southwest of Kaktovik; fig. 1), (2) proximity to measured sections described by previous workers (Armstrong and others, 1970; Wood and Armstrong, 1975; and Carlson, 1987) that were less accessible for conodont sampling, (3) excellent exposures of the Wahoo Limestone (95 percent) and its boundaries (fig. 5), and, in particular, (4) the relatively thick interval of upper Morrowan and Atokan strata.
Our measured section includes the upper 3 m of the Alapah Limestone, the entire Wahoo Limestone (262 m), and the basal 1 m of the succeeding Echooka Formation (pi. 6). The lower 3 m of the Wahoo Limestone is massivebedded dolomitized bryozoan packstone that overlies a 0.5-m-thick interval of light-gray, fenestral, dolomitic mudstone at the top of the Alapah Limestone. The lower and upper members of the Wahoo Limestone are readily distinguished; their boundary is placed at the change from cliff-forming, light-gray packstone below to orangeweathering, silty, cryptalgal(?) dolostone above (fig. 5). The contact with the overlying Echooka Formation forms a rubble-covered dip slope, but only a few meters of section are concealed. The section was systematically sampled for microlithofacies at 2-m intervals. Additional samples were taken to document obvious lithologic changes and at all conodont sample sites (table 1; pi. 6).
LOWER MEMBER OF THE WAHOO LIMESTONE
The lower member (Mississippian and Pennsylvanian) of the Wahoo Limestone is 70 m thick and is chiefly bryozoan-pelmatozoan grainstone and packstone. Rare beds of wackestone and skeletal packstone occur particularly in the basal part of the lower member and near the Mississippian-Pennsylvanian boundary and contain minor sponge spicules. Peloids, including completely micritized bioclasts, are a common constituent of the lower member and become abundant near the boundary. An interval of oolitic grainstone, 62 to 64 m above the base of the lower member, is the lowest occurrence of a lithology that typifies the upper member. Dark-gray replacement chert nodules are common throughout (pi. 6).
The lower member of the Wahoo Limestone formed on a predominantly open-marine platform that developed above restricted-platform carbonate deposits of the upper part of the Alapah Limestone (see fig. 9). Muddy and spiculitic limestone in the lower several meters of the Wahoo Limestone formed in partly restricted conditions during the early phase of a major transgression. The upper 25 m of the lower member primarily formed in normal-marine conditions, but common to abundant peloids and minor spicules suggest intermittent restriction; locally abundant ooids

imply proximity to shoals. These grain types indicate the onset of regression.
Just below the Mississippian-Pennsylvanian boundary, at 56 m above the base of the lower member of the Wahoo Limestone, a distinct interval of peloidal-spiculitic wackestone is partly replaced by reddish-brown and gray nodular chert. This chert-bearing interval has variable thickness (<0.5 to 1 m), sharp lower and upper contacts, and appears to have been deposited above an irregular surface with as much as 1 m of relief (fig. 6). The surface has been interpreted to have formed during subaerial exposure (Carlson, 1990; Watts, 1990). The chert-bearing interval overlies a skeletal grainstone that contains definitive Mississippian conodonts within 10 cm of the contact and, in turn, is overlain by a peloidal-skeletal grainstone, the base of which produced the lowest definitive Pennsylvanian conodonts in the study section (fig. 6). The chert-bearing interval was traced 1 km west to Carlson's (1987) section where Declinognathodus noduliferus japonicus, an index to the Pennsylvanian, occurs 1.5 m below the chert (app. 1, loc. IBlb), suggesting at least 1.5 m of erosion at the study section.
A comparable chert-rich interval was noted in Lower Pennsylvanian rocks (based on foraminiferan biostratigraphy) in the western Sadlerochit Mountains (Clough and Bakke, 1986; Imm, 1986). Correlation of this interval with the eastern Sadlerochit Mountains, however, has not been verified with conodonts. A chert-rich interval has not been noted in a similar stratigraphic position in sections to the south or east.
The contact between the lower and upper members of the Wahoo Limestone appears planar. Redeposited, latest Mississippian conodonts occur sporadically in the Pennsylvanian part of the lower member and increase in abundance a meter below the contact with the upper member (table 1). The redeposited conodonts indicate intermittent reworking of slightly older deposits of the Wahoo Limestone.
UPPER MEMBER OF THE WAHOO LIMESTONE
The upper member of the Wahoo Limestone is 192 m thick at the study section and contains many shallowingupward parasequences. These parasequences are superimposed on a major TR sequence.
The lower 24 m of the upper member is dominated by peloidal-bryozoan packstone, dolomitized silty mudstone, and wackestone. Cryptalgal laminites are poorly developed in the study section but are present in nearby exposures. Shallowing-upward parasequences in this interval begin with peloidal-bryozoan packstone (minor grainstone) and pass upward into dolomitized, silty, locally spiculitic, lime mudstone. Detrital quartz is relatively abundant (as much as 40 percent), particularly in dolomitic mudstone. Significantly, quartz sand increases from 3 to 4.5 percent in the upper meter of the lower member and then abruptly rises to

Figure 6. Mississippian-Pennsylvanian boundary beds in upper part of lower member of the Wahoo Limestone at the study section showing the distinct reddish-brown and gray, nodular chert-bearing interval (arrows mark its top and bottom). Thickness of beds shown is approximately 4 m. Conodont samples at locations A-D. Sample A, 53 m above base of the Wahoo (table 1, USGS colln. 30757-PC), contains Gnathodus girtyi girtyi, G. g. simplex, and forms transitional to Declinognathodus spp. as well as C. bilineatus bilineatus, Hindeodus minutus, Vogelgnathus postcampbelli, and Kladognathus sp. Sample B, 54.9 m above base of formation (table 1, USGS colln. 31698-PC), contains Mississippian species including C. g. girtyi, Kladognathus spp., and Lochriea commutata as well as subadult Pa elements of C. g. simplex transitional to D. noduliferus japonicus and abundant Cavusg-

nathusl tytthus of Mississippian and Pennsylvanian age. Sample C, 55.5 m above the base and within the cherty interval (table 1, USGS colln. 31699-PC), produced only a few conodonts, chiefly C.I tytthus of Mississippian and Pennsylvanian age. In sample D, 56 m above base of formation, D. n. japonicus (pi. 3, figs. 4-8), an index to the Pennsylvanian, occurs with several other species known to range across the Mississippian-Pennsylvanian boundary (table 1, USGS collns. 30758-PC and 31700-PC). Collections 1 km to the west yielded Pennsylvanian conodonts 1.5 m below reddish-brown and gray chert-bearing interval suggesting that the irregular surface at base of chert is a disconformity that probably marks the Mississippian-Pennsylvanian boundary at the study section.

an average of 12 percent in the lower 20 m of the upper member (percent quartz determined from acid-insoluble residues of conodont samples). This sudden increase of terrigenous sediment at and above the lower member-upper member contact suggests considerable regression and some exposure of the Wahoo platform. Indeed, exposure surfaces in the lower part of the upper member and local channeliza-

tion of cryptalgal laminites at the lower member-upper member contact have been described in the eastern Sadlerochit Mountains here and 1 km to the west (Carlson, 1987, 1990; Watts, 1991). In addition, relatively few conodonts and foraminifers are found in this part of the upper member, possibly due to inhospitable environmental conditions. The lower 24 m of the upper member formed on a

12 CONODONT BIOSTRATIGRAPHY AND BIOFACIES OF THE WAHOO LIMESTONE

predominantly restricted platform during a major regression and contain some of the shallowest water deposits in the Wahoo Limestone (Gruzlovic, 1991).
The succeeding 120 m of the upper member of the Wahoo Limestone are characterized by oolitic grainstones, particularly the upper part of the member (pi. 6). Bioclasts and peloids are common and grapestone lumps, intraclasts, and Archaeolithophyllum sp. (algae) are rare to minor in these high-energy grainstones and associated packstones. Oncolites are most common in the lower part of this interval whereas Donezella sp. (algae) occur in the upper part, first appearing at 167 m above the base of the Wahoo (P.L. Brenckle, written commun., 1991) suggesting some environmental restriction up section. Shallowing-upward parasequences typically begin with dolomitic bryozoan wackestone and pass upward into dominantly skeletal and oolitic grainstone that may be capped by dolomitized, locally spiculitic, lime mudstone. Repeated intervals of oolitic grainstone represent migration of shoals across the Wahoo platform. Oncoids, peloids, grapestone lumps, and algae indicate that open-platform depositional environments developed shoreward of the shoals. Rare, isolated colonial and solitary corals also occur and are locally associated with spiculitic mudstone and peloids that suggest proximity to partly restricted conditions. The abundant ooid-shoal deposits in the upper part of this interval correspond with the maximum transgression during deposition of the upper member of the Wahoo (Watts, 1990; Gruzlovic, 1991).
The upper 48 m of the upper member of the Wahoo Limestone are chiefly peloidal-oncolitic and bryozoanpelmatozoan packstone and grainstone (pi. 6). Ooids and superficial ooids occur in the lower part of the member, representing the last ooid-shoal deposits of the Wahoo. Peloidal-spiculitic-oncolitic wackestone and spiculitic mudstone become prevalent approximately 13 m below the top of the formation, marking a shift from primarily openplatform to restricted-platform environments.
Persistent sea-level fluctuations during deposition of the Wahoo Limestone produced a mosaic of shifting environments that controlled biotic distribution. Conodont and foraminiferan biofacies (species associations) reflect these environmental changes. Biofacies, as well as postmortem transport of skeletal remains, controlled the occurrence of biostratigraphically significant species and, ultimately, the biozonation of the Wahoo Limestone.

Figure 7. Conodont zonation/faunal succession recognized in the Wahoo Limestone at study section compared to the North American middle Carboniferous conodont zonation of Baesemann and Lane (1985). Zonal indicators of Baesemann and Lane not found at study section include Neognathodus symmetricus, N. bassleri, Idiognathodus klapperi, and Idiognathoides convexus. Declinognathodus noduliferus first appears 13 m above Globivalvulina bulloides, the foraminiferan secondary guide to the midCarboniferous boundary (Lane and Manger, 1985). See figure 6 and table 1 for detailed information on the MississippianPennsylvanian boundary. Idiognathodus sinuosus first appears 6 m above Pseudostaffella sp., a foraminiferan guide to the MorrowanAtokan boundary in the Midcontinent and Cordillera of the conterminous United States (Lane and Manger, 1985; Groves, 1986). The Morrowan-Atokan boundary is poorly constrained by conodonts and foraminifers. The foraminifer Pseudostaffella sp. appears well below the lowest definitive Atokan conodont, Idiognathodus incurvusl (table 1). G, Globivalvulina.

Pennsylvanian (Morrowan) rocks in North America only applies to the conodont succession in the upper part of the Alapah Limestone and the succeeding 84 m of the Wahoo Limestone (fig. 7).

minutus Fauna (= sinuatus-minutus and symmetricus Zones of Baesemann and Lane, 1985) are well documented in this part of the section (table 1 and pi. 6). The remaining Pennsylvanian strata, however, could not be precisely dated by using existing conodont zonal schemes (for example, Baesemann and Lane, 1985; Gray son, 1990) because of a persistent, chiefly rhachistognathid biofacies (high-energy, shoal to near-shoal environments) in which most zonal indicators are rare or absent. We have, instead, used a faunal designation for this part of the Wahoo Limestone based on possible local ranges of some rhachistognathids and what is almost certainly a relatively late migration of Idiognathodus into northeast Alaska. Some of the rhachistognathids that appear before or originate in the lower 84 m of the Wahoo Limestone disappear before the lowest occurrence of Idiognathodus in the northeast Brooks Range; other rhachistognathids persist to the major unconformity that truncates the formation (pi. 6). Rare, sporadic occurrences of generally poorly preserved, nonrhachistognathid species are not originations but are clearly the result of postmortem hydraulic admixture from other biofacies and can be used to roughly tie the northeast Alaskan succession to successions in other parts of North America.
Species diversity is rather low for a section that spans at least 10 million years, from the latest Chesterian to at least early Atokan. Only 24 species, distributed among 14 genera, were identified in 72 productive samples. Further complicating establishment of a reliable conodont succession for part of the Wahoo Limestone is the menace of redeposition. Several samples from the post-Mississippian part of the study section (table 1 and pi. 6), as well as many other spot samples from the uppermost part of the Wahoo Limestone in the northeast Brooks Range, produced redeposited Mississippian and earliest Pennsylvanian conodonts that cast some doubt on the biostratigraphic integrity of species distribution in the upper part of the formation.
The conodont zones of Baesemann and Lane (1985) and the conodont faunal succession established in the Wahoo Limestone and upper part of the Alapah Limestone at the study section and elsewhere in the northeast Brooks Range are described below.

The muricatus Zone is defined by the first appearance of Rhachistognalhus muricatus below the occurrence of either Declinognathodus noduliferus or R. primus (Lane and Straka, 1974; Baesemann and Lane, 1985). Baesemann and Lane (1985) proposed a phylogeny for the rhachistognathids of the middle Carboniferous in which R. prolixus is the inferred ancestor. They suggested that R. prolixus probably gave rise to R. muricatus after the appearance of Adetognathus unicornis (= Cavusgnathus monocerus [Rexroad and Burton] of Brown and others, 1990) the name

bearer of the preceding conodont zone. Baesemann and Lane (1985) subdivided the muricatus Zone into lower and upper subzones. The muricatus Zone is the most widely recognized conodont zone in the Chesterian part of the Lisburne Group in the northeast Brooks Range. It is represented by a very thick sequence that may include much of the Alapah Limestone and part of the Wahoo Limestone and is well documented in nine sections between Atigun River gorge and the Clarence River (fig. 1; A.G. Harris and A.P. Krumhardt, unpub. data). At and near the study section, the muricatus Zone is at least 155 m thick and ranges from about 24 m above the base of the Alapah Limestone (app. 1, loc. 1A2) to 55.5 m above the base of the Wahoo Limestone (table 1, USGS colln. 30757-PC). It is apparently thickest (250 m) in the Romanzof Mountains (app. 1, Iocs. 9Bla, b). In the area of the type section of the Wahoo Limestone, the upper 70 m of the Alapah Limestone and lower 140 m of the overlying Wahoo Limestone are within the muricatus Zone (app. 1, Iocs. 4Ala, c).
LOWER MURICATUS SUBZONE
The Lower muricatus Subzone is defined by the first appearance of the zonal indicator below the occurrence of Adetognathus lautus. This subzone has not yet been identified at the study section or in our other collections from northern Alaska but may be present in the Alapah Limestone. As proposed (Baesemann and Lane, 1985), the subzone can be identified only in closely sampled sections of appropriate shallow-water, relatively normal-marine biofacies. Virtually all common associates of this biofacies in the Lower muricatus Subzone, with the possible exception of Hindeodus cristulus (Youngquist and Miller), extend or likely extend into the Upper muricatus Subzone (table 1; Weibel and Norby, 1992). Thus, the only guide to this zone is the presence of A. lautus in definitive pre-Pennsylvanian strata above the occurrence of Rhachistognathus muricatus with H. cristulus.
UPPER MURICATUS SUBZONE
This subzone is defined by the overlapping ranges of Rhachistognathus muricatus and Adetognathus lautus below the appearance of Declinognathodus noduliferus or R. primus. As yet, R. muricatus has not been found in the upper 64 m of the Alapah Limestone or the succeeding lower 5 m of the Wahoo Limestone in the eastern Sadlerochit Mountains. Representatives of the species were recovered 6 m above the base of the formation and well below D. noduliferus (table 1). Adetognathus lautus, although not found in the lower 84 m of the Wahoo Limestone, was recovered from the Alapah Limestone at 72 and 65 m below the base of the Wahoo Limestone at the study section (app. 1, Iocs. lAla, b). Thus, the Upper muricatus Subzone is

14 CONODONT BIOSTRATIGRAPHY AND BIOFACIES OF THE WAHOO LIMESTONE

present at a level considerably below the base of the Wahoo Limestone and is at least 127 m thick (from 72 m below the top of the Alapah Limestone to 56 m above the base of the Wahoo Limestone).
Species that occur within the Upper muricatus Subzone in the Alapah and Wahoo Limestones in the study section include, in order of decreasing abundance, Cavusgnathus unicornis Youngquist and Miller, Kladognathus spp., Gnathodus girtyi simplex Dunn, G. g. girtyi Hass, Hindeodus minutus (Ellison), Rhachistognathus muricatus (Dunn), Vogelgnathus postcampbelli (Austin and Husri), C.I tytthus Brown and Rexroad, G. bilineatus bilineatus (Roundy), Idioprioniodus spp., AdeTognathus lautus (Gunnell) (see app. 1, Iocs. lAla, b), Lochriea commutata (Branson and Mehl), G. girtyi subspp. transitional to Declinognathodus spp., C. altus Harris and Rollings worth, R. prolixus Baesemann and Lane?, and Gnathodus defectus Dunn?.
Cavusgnathus monocerus (Rexroad and Burton), a relatively common component of the R. muricatus Zone as well as the name bearer of the preceding conodont zone, is notably absent in the Brooks Range.
The Upper muricatus Subzone is recognized in the upper part of the Alapah Limestone and lower part of the Wahoo Limestone in six sections (including the study section) between Wahoo Lake and the Clarence River. The subzone is thickest (at least 133 m) at Clarence River and includes at least the upper 53 m of the Alapah Limestone and the lower 80 m of the Wahoo Limestone (app. 1, Iocs. lOAla-e) and at least 124.5 m near Wahoo Lake (app. 1, Iocs. 4Alb, c). The only other species found in the subzone in the northeast Brooks Range, but not in the study section, is Rhachistognathus websteri Baesemann and Lane (app. 1, loc. 4Alc).
NODULIFERUS-PRIMUS ZONE
Baesemann and Lane (1985) modified the primus Zone of Lane and Straka (1974) to the noduliferus-primus Zone, the lower boundary of which marks the base of the Morrowan Series and the Pennsylvanian System. Whereas Rhachistognathus primus has not been found outside of North America, Declinognathodus noduliferus has a worldwide distribution and has been recommended as the primary micropaleontologic guide for the base of the Pennsylvanian (Lane and Manger, 1985). The noduliferus-primus Zone is recognized by the occurrence of either D. noduliferus or R. primus below the appearance of R. minutus or Idiognathoides sinuatus Harris and Hollingsworth. The zone was subdivided into lower and upper subzones by Brenckle and others (1977). The lower subzone is characterized by "the overlap in the upper ranges of Gnathodus girtyi simplex and G. cf. G. bollandensis with the lower ranges of R. primus and D. noduliferus" (Baesemann and Lane, 1985, p. 100).

We assume that G. cf. G. bollandensis of Baesemann and Lane (1985) is G. bilineatus bollandensis of other workers or a form close to it. Gnathodus girtyi simplex has been reported together with D. noduliferus in Nevada (Baesemann and Lane, 1985). In our study section, G. g. girtyi and G. g. simplex occur relatively consistently in the lower 54.9m of the Wahoo Limestone, 1.1 m below the first occurrence of D. noduliferus japonicus (table 1). Neither subspecies has been recovered from the succeeding 10 m, but 4 and 5 m higher G. g. girtyi reappears together with G. b. bilineatus and Kladognathus spp. as well as other species (table 1). We believe that these typical Mississippian forms are redeposited. Significantly, Carlson (1987) reported channelization at this level about 1 km to the west. It is possible that other Pennsylvanian occurrences of G. g. girtyi are also redeposited, as shown for the Granite Mountain, Utah section, by Wardlaw (1984). Gnathodus bilineatus bollandensis has not been recognized in the study section and G. g. simplex does not occur in the noduliferus-primus Zone here. Thus, we cannot recognize the subdivisions of the noduliferus-primus Zone at the study section. Elsewhere in the northeast Brooks Range, G. g. simplex is a rare, possibly indigenous constituent of the noduliferus-primus Zone (app. 1, Iocs. 5b, IBle).
Species that occur in the noduliferus-primus Zone in the study section include, in order of decreasing abundance, Cavusgnathusl tytthus, Declinognathodus noduliferus japonicus (Igo and Koike), Rhachistognathus muricatus, Hindeodus minutus, D. n. noduliferus (Ellison and Graves), Vogelgnathus postcampbelli, Idioprioniodus conjunctus (Gunnell)?, R. websteri, and Gnathodus girtyi subspp. transitional to Declinognathodus spp. Rhachistognathus primus has not been identified in this zone in our section but has been found elsewhere in the zone in the northeast Brooks Range (app. 1, loc. 4B). Additional guides for the noduliferus-primus Zone in the northeast Brooks Range are Cavusgnathusl tytthus and Vogelgnathus postcampbelli with or above D. noduliferus (table 1). Cavusgnathusl tytthus extends to near the top of the zone, is common, and appears to occupy the habitat of Adetognathus lautus, which is notably absent in this zone in collections in the northeast Brooks Range; V postcampbelli has a similar range but is rare in the study section. Only 1 km to the west, V. postcampbelli is relatively abundant (app. 1, loc. IBlg). Other species found in the zone in the northeast Brooks Range, but not in the study section, are G. girtyi simplex (app. 1, Iocs. 4B, 4Ald, 5a) and R. prolixus (app. 1, loc. 5a).
Beds 56 to 84 m above the base of the Wahoo Limestone in the study section are representative of the noduliferus-primus Zone (table 1). The zone is recognized within the lower member of the formation in three other sections, as far west as Wahoo Lake. These are (1) the Sunset Pass section (app. 1, Iocs. IBlb-g); (2) the Pogopuk Creek section (app. 1, Iocs. 5a, b), where the zone is thickest in the northeast Brooks Range (at least 80 m) and where the

15

highest sample in the zone contains Gnathodus girtyi simplex suggesting a level presumably within the lower part of the zone; and (3) in the vicinity of the type section near Wahoo Lake (app. 1, Iocs. 4Ald, 4B).
MINUTUS FAUNA
Considerable controversy surrounds the time of origin of Rhachistognathus minutus. Baesemann and Lane (1985) proposed a phylogeny for rhachistognathids in which R. minutus evolved from R. muricatus some time after the appearance of R. primus and Declinognathodus noduliferus. Lane and others (1985b) noted that Higgins (1975) reported R. minutus below the first appearance of D. noduliferus in the Craven basin, northern England. In order to explain the succession of rhachistognathids in chiefly shallow-water carbonate rocks of North America, a hiatus was inferred in the Craven basin succession encompassing the interval of the North American unicornis, muricatus, noduliferusprimus, and most of the sinuatus-minutus Zones (Lane and others, 1985b). However, Riley and others (1987) demonstrated persuasively that R. minutus appears substantially later in North America than in northern England. Manger and Sutherland (1992) support the interpretation of Riley and others (1987) in their comprehensive summary of this controversy. We agree that the appearance of R. minutus in many areas of North America is a migration event, so that the lower boundary of the sinuatus-minutus Zone (based on R. minutus) is diachronous from England to North America. Rhachistognathus minutus has a very short range in England but is relatively long ranging and widespread in the Cordillera of North America (including Alaska) where it is most abundant in high-energy, shallow-water deposits. According to Baesemann and Lane (1985), R. minutus extends into at least the lower Atokan.
We are introducing a minutus Fauna to identify the local range of Rhachistognathus minutus subspp. below the range of Idiognathodus spp. The lower boundary of this fauna undoubtedly varies within the northeast Brooks Range because its distribution is biofacies dependent. The sinuatus-minutus Zone of Baesemann and Lane (1985) is not used because Idiognathoides sinuatus (as defined by Grayson and others, 1990) was found in only a single sample high in the study section (table 1). Furthermore, the succeeding symmetricus Zone (as used by Lane and Straka, 1974) cannot be recognized because of the apparent absence of the zonal indicator in the Brooks Range. In the western Canada sedimentary basin of the Canadian Cordillera, Higgins and others (1991) recognize a minutus Zone that includes the sinuatus-minutus and symmetricus Zones of Baesemann and Lane (1985) because of the absence of Idiognathoides sinuatus and Neognathodus symmetricus in their sections. The minutus Zone of western Canada contains diverse rhachistognathids and is probably equivalent

to the lower part of our minutus Fauna. Indeed, we recognize a lower subdivision of the minutus Fauna by the overlapping ranges of R. minutus subspp. and R. websteri. In our section, R. websteri ranges slightly higher than R. muricatus. Baesemann and Lane (1985) indicate that R. websteri does not occur above their symmetricus Zone in North America, and they show R. muricatus extending into the lower Atokan. According to J.F. Baesemann and H.R. Lane (oral commun., 1992), R. muricatus may be absent from the upper Morrowan part of the Wahoo Limestone and is rare in the post-Morrowan part. These late forms of the species are small and atypical of early R. muricatus. The only small rhachistognathids from the highest part of the Wahoo Limestone are juveniles of R. minutus that occur with adults of R. minutus subspp. (table 1, USGS colln. 30800-PC).
In our section, the upper limit of the minutus Fauna is defined by the first appearance of Idiognathodus sp., 177 m above the base of the Wahoo Limestone (15m above the disappearance of Rhachistognathus websteri; table 1). The upper 15 m of the minutus Fauna contains few conodonts; most samples have a few specimens each of Declinognathodus noduliferus subspp., R. minutus subspp., and Adetognathus lautus. These upper 15 m may be equivalent to part of the Idiognathodus Fauna. Similarly, many other collections from single-sample localities or partial sections in the northeast Brooks Range contain R. minutus subspp. above or with D. noduliferus subspp. and (or) R. primus and lack R. muricatus, R. websteri, and idiognathodids. Such collections have been assigned to the minutus Fauna although, similar to the upper 15 m of the minutus Fauna in the study section, they could be equivalent to the Idiognathodus Fauna. For example, about 10 km north of Wahoo Lake, samples from the upper 132 m of the Wahoo Limestone contain R. minutus subspp., R. primus, D. n. noduliferus, adetognathids, and idioprioniodids and are assigned to the minutus Fauna (app. 1, Iocs. 4Cla-c).
In the northeast Brooks Range, the minutus Fauna is thickest (93 m) in the eastern Sadlerochit Mountains (table 1) and is at least 70 m thick at Katakturuk gorge, western Sadlerochit Mountains (app. 1, Iocs. 2a-g).
The foraminifers Pseudostaffella sp. and Eoschubertella sp. first appear in the upper part of the minutus Fauna at 171 m and 175 m above the base of the Wahoo Limestone, respectively (P.L. Brenckle, written commun., 1991). These species are used to approximate the base of the Atokan in much of North America (Groves, 1986). Their first occurrence in Alaska relative to the Morrowan-Atokan boundary remains uncertain, and conodonts provide no additional control.
LOWER MINUTUS FAUNA
The lower subdivision of the minutus Fauna is defined by the local overlapping ranges of Rhachistognathus

16 CONODONT BIOSTRATIGRAPHY AND BIOFACIES OF THE WAHOO LIMESTONE

muricatus, R. websteri, and R. minutus subspp. below the range of Idiognathodus spp. (pi. 6). In the northeast Brooks Range, this faunal interval contains the greatest diversity and abundance of rhachistognathids. Associated conodonts within the lower minutus Fauna in the study section include, in order of decreasing abundance, Rhachistognathus muricatus, R. minutus minutus (Higgins and Bouckaert), Adetognathus lautus, R. m. havlenai Baesemann and Lane, R. websteri, Declinognathodus noduliferus noduliferus, R. m. declinatus Baesemann and Lane, A. spathus, D. n. japonicus, Idioprioniodus spp., Hindeodus minutus, Gnathodus defectus, and R. prolixusl. The interval contains a few specimens of Kladognathus spp. in one sample, which we consider redeposited. No additional species have been recognized within the lower minutus Fauna in our many collections from the northeast Brooks Range.
Rhachistognathus websteri and R. muricatus do not occur above the lower minutus Fauna in the study section (table 1). Rhachistognathids generally maintain their dominance higher in the section, but with reduced diversity; R. m. declinatus is the most abundant rhachistognathid above the lower minutus Fauna. The lower minutus Fauna is likely Morrowan in age because the foraminiferan guides to the base of the Atokan occur in the upper part of the minutus Fauna. The lower minutus Fauna roughly correlates with the sinuatus-minutus to symmetricus Zones of Baesemann and Lane (1985; fig. 7, this report).
Rhachistognathus minutus appears 84 m above the base of the Wahoo Limestone (14 m above the base of the upper member) and R. websteri disappears 78 m higher in the study section (table 1). At Katakturuk River gorge, in the western Sadlerochit Mountains (fig. 2, loc. 2), at least 34.5 m of the Wahoo Limestone contain the lower minutus Fauna (app. 1, Iocs. 2a-d). The fauna is also present in a 43.5-m-thick interval in the lower member of the formation at Pogopuk Creek (app. 1, Iocs. 5c-e) and in a single sample from the upper member in the Clarence River area (app. 1, loc. lOAlf).
IDIOGNATHODUS FAUNA
This fauna is characterized chiefly by the association of Idiognathodus spp., Rhachistognathus minutus subspp., and Adetognathus lautus; the first appearance of Idiognathodus spp. in the Wahoo Limestone marks its lower boundary. The upper boundary cannot be defined biostratigraphically but is placed at the unconformity that separates the Wahoo Limestone from the overlying Echooka Formation (Permian). The lower boundary could be as old as the sinuosus Zone (late Morrowan) of Baesemann and Lane (1985) or as young as early Atokan. At least half the idiognathodids in our collections from the northeast Brooks Range cannot be determined to species because of poor preservation. Many of the rocks that produce abundant

Idiognathodus are high-energy oolitic to skeletal grainstones resulting in incomplete and moderately to extremely abraded specimens. Most of the better preserved specimens are assigned to /. sinuosus Ellison and Graves following the species concept of Grayson and others (1989; 1990). This species ranges from the base of the sinuosus Zone (upper Morrowan) to at least the Upper Pennsylvanian; it ranges from 187 to 243 m above the base of the Wahoo Limestone in our section (table 1) and above the lowest occurrence of Pseudostaffella sp. (fig. 7). If the latter approximates the base of the Atokan in Alaska, then the first occurrence of /. sinuosus (16m higher in the study section) is in the early Atokan and considerably later than its debut in the type Morrowan in Arkansas. Two specimens from 246 to 250 m above the base of the Wahoo Limestone are assigned to /. incurvus Dunn? sensu Grayson and others (1989) (table 1). Idiognathodus incurvus is restricted to the Atokan and lower Desmoinesian (Grayson and others, 1989); therefore, the upper 16 m of the Idiognathodus Fauna in the study section is probably no older than Atokan. In addition, R. minutus subspp., identified in samples from the uppermost part of the Wahoo Limestone, is not known to extend above the lower Atokan (Baesemann and Lane, 1985). Therefore, the top of the Idiognathodus Fauna in our section is considered no younger than early Atokan in age.
Conodonts that occur in the Idiognathodus Fauna in the study section include, in order of decreasing abundance, Rhachistognathus minutus declinatus, Declinognathodus noduliferus noduliferus, Idiognathodus sinuosus, Adetognathus lautus, D. n. japonicus, R. m. havlenai, R. m. minutus, A. spathus, Idioprioniodus spp., Hindeodus minutus, Idiognathoides sinuatus (Harris and Hollingsworm), Idiognathodus incurvusl, Diplognathodusl ellesmerensisl', and Neognathodusl sp. indet. Taken together, our many collections from the Idiognathodus Fauna from elsewhere in the northeast Brooks Range have fewer species than the study section (see app. 1).
The Idiognathodus Fauna is widespread in the uppermost part of the Wahoo Limestone across the northeast Brooks Range, from the Philip Smith Mountains to the Yukon (fig. 1). Some of the localities (see app. 1) that produced this fauna include [samples are from the upper 1 m of the Wahoo Limestone, except as noted] (1) northwestern Philip Smith Mountains (Iocs. 3A, B), (2) 4.5 m below the top of the Wahoo Limestone near its type section, Philip Smith Mountains (loc. 4D), (3) Pogopuk Creek, Franklin Mountains (loc. 5f), (4) central Fourth Range (loc. 7b), (5) central Shublik Mountains (loc. 8), (6) 6-m-thick interval in upper part of the Wahoo Limestone (Iocs. 2h, i) and the uppermost (loc. 2j) beds, Katakturuk River gorge, western Sadlerochit Mountains, (7) eastern Sadlerochit Mountains (loc. 1C), (8) central Romanzof Mountains (loc. 9A), (9) upper 45 m of the Wahoo Limestone, Clarence River, northern British Mountains, Alaska (Iocs. lOAlg, h), and (10) near the top of Wahoo Limestone, northern British Moun-

THE MID-CARBONIFEROUS BOUNDARY—AN APPROXIMATION
OF THE MISSISSIPPIANPENNSYLVANIAN BOUNDARY
BIOSTRATIGRAPHIC CRITERIA
Three major fossil groups, ammonoids, foraminifers, and conodonts, have been used for zoning the Carboniferous and as guides to the mid-Carboniferous boundary (Sutherland and Manger, 1984b; Manger and Sutherland, 1992). In 1983, the Subcommission on Carboniferous Stratigraphy (SCCS) approved several recommendations regarding the various biostratigraphic criteria for establishing an international mid-Carboniferous boundary (Lane and Manger, 1985). These include— (1) The transition between the Eumorphoceras and
Homoceras ammonoid zones. Homoceras, however, is geographically restricted and not useful for global correlations. (2) The first appearance of the conodont Declinognathodus noduliferus, preferably together with its ancestor Gnathodus girtyi simplex. Secondary guides to the boundary include the first appearance of the conodonts Adetognathus lautus, Rhachistognathus primus, and R. minutus and the foraminifers Globivalvulina sp. D of Brenckle (=G. moderata = G. bulloides; PL. Brenckle, oral commun., 1991), Millerella pressa Thompson, and M. marblensis Thompson. These recommendations are not yet ratified because a stratotype has not been selected. Nevertheless, the recommendations of the SCCS are useful for defining the mid-Carboniferous boundary in marine successions (Lane and others, 1985b; Riley and others, 1987) and are followed here. The faunal succession across the mid-Carboniferous boundary in North America and elsewhere has been extensively documented (for example, Ziegler and Lane, 1985; Brenckle and Manger, 1990; Sutherland and Manger, 1992). The lithofacies and conodont succession in our section are most like those described from Nevada, Utah, and Montana (Wardlaw, 1984; Baesemann and Lane, 1985; Davis and Webster, 1985; Morrow and Webster, 1991, 1992). These studies, however, indicate significant inconsistencies in conodont distribution and possible misinterpretations of depositional continuity that affect zonal schemes. For example, in the Arrow Canyon section, Nevada, Baesemann and Lane (1985) place the Mississippian-Pennsylvanian boundary at the simultaneous first occurrence of Declinognathodus noduliferus, Rhachistognathus primus, and R.

websteri immediately above beds containing Adetognathus lautus, R. muricatus, and Gnathodus girtyi simplex. Gnathodus girtyi simplex occurs in 10 samples taken through a 6-m-thick interval above the boundary (Baesemann and Lane, 1985, fig. 2). Thus, beds representing the Upper muricatus Subzone are overlain by beds representing the Lower noduliferus-primus Zone. Their lithic column shows a 2-m-thick clastic-rich interval less than 1 m above the boundary that occurs in a limestone. According to field observations made by K.F. Watts in 1989, the systemic boundary lies at a lithic change from crinoidal packstone-grainstone to packstone having a greenish matrix and sand-filled burrows in its uppermost part. The clastic interval less than 1 m above the boundary contains a variety of lithologies including mixed-pebble conglomerate in a carbonate and lesser quartz sand matrix and flat-pebble conglomerate. These features suggest a change in depositional regime, possibly beginning at the boundary but certainly occurring less than 1 m above it. The first appearance of Declinognathodus and new species of Rhachistognathus may be a migration event related to changing environmental factors associated with the lithic changes. Conodont collections made by B.R. Wardlaw and R.G. Stamm (U.S. Geological Survey, unpub. data), at 0.5-m intervals from 14.5 m below to 2 m above the boundary as designated by Baesemann and Lane (1985) reveal additional problems. In these collections, R. primus is limited to one sample 4 m below the only sample containing D. noduliferus (taken at the systemic boundary). Thus, in Arrow Canyon, R. primus appears before, rather than together with, D. noduliferus.
At Granite Mountain, Utah, Morrow and Webster (1992) report the appearance of Rhachistognathus primus 9 m below the first Declinognathodus noduliferus. They place the Mississippian-Pennsylvanian boundary at the first occurrence of D. noduliferus on the basis of comparisons to other localities where R. primus occurs below D. noduliferus. We agree with Morrow and Webster (1991) that the rarity of D. noduliferus and gnathodids at Granite Mountain is biofacies related and that the first appearance of D. noduliferus is a migration event. We do not, however, agree with their placement of the primus Zone interval in the Mississippian (Morrow and Webster, 1992), as it could just as well be partly or entirely Pennsylvanian in age.
As documented above, our own and published data suggest Rhachistognathus primus evolved shortly before Declinognathodus noduliferus. Rhachistognathus primus is relatively rare in the northeast Brooks Range. Only one collection contains R. primus not constrained by D. noduliferus; it is assigned to the noduliferus-primus Zone (app. l,loc.4B)
The ancestry of Declinognathodus noduliferus, the micropaleontologic guide to the base of the Pennsylvanian, remains controversial with conflicting evidence indicating ancestry from either Gnathodus girtyi simplex or G. bilineatus. Grayson and others (1985b), Grayson and others

18 CONODONT BIOSTRATIGRAPHY AND BIOFACIES OF THE WAHOO LIMESTONE

(1990), and Grayson (1990) consider G. bilineatus ancestral to D. noduliferus on the basis of apparatus comparisons. Indeed, examination of chiefly Pa elements from a proposed mid-Carboniferous stratotype section in middle Asia strongly supports the G. bilineatus ancestry (Nigmadganov and Nemirovskaya, 1992a, 1992b; Nemirovskaya and Nigmadganov, 1994). Our data, however, are equally convincing for a G. g. simplex ancestry (see below). The controversy concerning the ancestry of D. noduliferus may be the result of homeomorphy. Pa elements documenting the evolution of G. bilineatus bollandensis to G. postbilineatus to D. praenoduliferus and, finally, to D. noduliferus noduliferus (Nigmadganov and Nemirovskaya, 1992a; Nemirovskaya and Nigmadganov, 1994) are just as convincing as those documenting the evolution of G. girtyi simplex to D. n. japonicus and (or) D. n. noduliferus (Dunn, 1970b; this report). It may be that the Pa elements presently recognized as those of D. noduliferus are polyphyletic.
Presently, the leading candidate section for the midCarboniferous boundary stratotype is in Arrow Canyon, Nev. (Baesemann and Lane, 1985). The first appearance of Declinognathodus noduliferus inaequalis, D. n. japonicus, or D. n. noduliferus in the section marks the midCarboniferous boundary and will be used to mark the base of the Pennsylvanian System.
CONODONT-BASED BOUNDARY IN THE EASTERN SADLEROCHIT MOUNTAINS
Gnathodus girtyi simplex transitional to Declinognathodus noduliferus japonicus first appears at 53 m above the base of the Wahoo Limestone (table 1). Additional specimens were found at 54.9 m above the base of the formation, immediately below a reddish-brown and gray chert-bearing peloidal spiculitic wackestone interval (fig. 6). Declinognathodus noduliferus japonicus first appears immediately above the chert-bearing interval, at 56 m above the base of the Wahoo Limestone (table 1). The mid-Carboniferous boundary may be no higher than 55 m above the base of the Wahoo Limestone and below the chert-bearing interval at the study section because 1 km to the west (app. 1, Iocs. IBla-g) D. n. japonicus is common in a 1.5-m interval below a reddish-brown and gray chert-bearing peloidal spiculitic wackestone. The chert-bearing interval can be traced between the two localities. Collections from within it contain similar conodont faunules (app. 1, loc. IB If; table 1, USGS colln. 31699-PC). Its base is a discontinuity and has a relief of at least 1 m. It may be that the 1.5-m interval containing D. n. japonicus below the discontinuity to the west was cut out at the study section.
Other, less diagnostic guides to the mid-Carboniferous boundary are either rare or absent in the boundary interval. Adetognathus lautus does not occur in this interval for environmental reasons but does occur 121 m below it (app. 1, loc. lAlb) and 28 m above it (table 1), and Rhachisto-

gnathus primus has not been recognized. Additional guides include the last appearance of Cavusgnathus spp. at 3 m below the boundary and the continuation of C.I tytthus and Vogelgnathus postcampbelli to 20.5 m above the boundary. A few representatives of species believed to be restricted to the Mississippian occur sporadically above the boundary; these are shown in table 1 as redeposited.
FORAMINIFERAN-BASED BOUNDARY IN THE EASTERN SADLEROCHIT MOUNTAINS
The Mamet and Skipp (1970) foraminiferan zonation has been used extensively to correlate the Lisburne Group in northern Alaska (for example, Armstrong and others, 1970, Armstrong and Mamet, 1975, 1977; Dutro, 1987). Mamet and Skipp (1970) and subsequent publications by Mamet and his co-workers place the mid-Carboniferous (Mississippian-Pennsylvanian) boundary coincident with the boundary between foraminiferan Zones 19 and 20. The base of Zone 20 is defined by the appearance of the Lipinella-Millerella sensu stricto assemblage (Armstrong and others, 1970). Later, Mamet (1975) amended Zone 20 to include the first diaphanotheca-bearing Globivalvulina.
Studies in the eastern Sadlerochit Mountains show inconsistencies in lithostratigraphic and chronostratigraphic boundaries with the foraminiferan zonation (fig. 8). Armstrong's (1972) boundary between the Alapah Limestone
Figure 8. Comparison of lithostratigraphic, biostratigraphic, and time-rock boundaries between study section and the nearby Sunset Pass section analyzed in previous reports. Prior to Carlson (1987; column 4), all interpretations for the Sunset Pass section (fig. 2, loc. IB) were based on one composite section (Armstrong and others, 1970, sections 68A-4A, 4B); Carlson's section is along the same traverse. The Alapah LimestoneWahoo Limestone boundary is at the same stratigraphic level in columns 2, 4, and 5 but differs from that in columns 1 and 3. Foraminiferan zonal boundaries in columns 1-4 were determined by B.L. Mamet; foraminiferan data for column 5 are from P.L. Brenckle (b; written commun., 1991) and Sylvie Pinard (p; written commun., 1991). In column 5, the first occurrence of the diagnostic foraminifer that approximates the base of the Pennsylvanian, Globivalvulina bulloides, is at least 13 m below the first Declinognathodus noduliferus. P.L. Brenckle (written commun., 1991) also noted the last occurrence of Brenckleina rugosa well above its known range in the conterminous United States (at or very slightly above the base of the Pennsylvanian). See figure 6 and table 1 for specific information on the Mississippian-Pennsylvanian boundary. The Morrowan-Atokan boundary is poorly constrained by conodonts. Pseudostaffella sp. is used to approximate this boundary in the Midcontinent and Cordillera of the conterminous United States (Lane and Manger, 1985; Groves, 1986). In the study section, it appears 14 m above the lowest occurrence of its plectostaffellid ancestor and 75 m below the first definitive Atokan conodont. NML, "No Man's Land" as used by B.L.

20 CONODONT BIOSTRATIGRAPHY AND BIOFACIES OF THE WAHOO LIMESTONE

and Wahoo Limestone and his systemic boundary are similar to our results; however, Armstrong and Mamet (1975, 1977) subsequently changed the position of both boundaries (fig. 8). Most of the reports cited in figure 8 use the original section measurements and thin sections that were first used by Armstrong and others (1970). Carlson's (1987) section is at or immediately adjacent to Armstrong's original section but was sampled in more detail. Analysis of Carlson's samples by Mamet (in Carlson, 1987) produced results different than those in previous reports. The reasons for changing lithostratigraphic and chronostratigraphic boundaries, however, were not explained. It is likely that biostratigraphic criteria changed, and the formation boundary was moved to approximate the systemic boundary.
In the northeast Brooks Range, Mamet and Armstrong (1984, p. 435) recognized an "...undetermined interval between Zones 19 and 20 [which] represents a very small amount of the sedimentation column but is a stratigraphic break lacking any characteristic paleontologic association." Mamet called this interval "No Man's Land" or NML (in Carlson, 1987; in Gruzlovic, 1991; this report, fig. 8). According to Mamet (in Clough and Bakke, 1986; in Carlson, 1987), the NML interval is correlative with the Mississippian-Pennsylvanian regional unconformity of the Midcontinent of North America.
Because foraminifers have been the principal fossils used for correlating the Lisburne Group, we were eager to tie our conodont biostratigraphy to Mamet's foraminiferan zonation. Unfortunately, the original Sunset Pass section was not logistically suitable for conodont sampling, but our study section, 1 km to the east, is close enough to assure lithologic correlation and thus permit comparison of conodont and foraminiferan data. Microlithofacies samples were taken every 2 m or less to coincide with conodont samples and lithologic changes and were also used for foraminiferan analyses. The conodont-based MississippianPennsylvanian boundary generally does not agree with the boundary determined by foraminifers. Figure 8 shows the conodont-based boundary at about the same stratigraphic level as given in columns 1 and 2, but about 25 m higher than in column 3, and about 17 m lower than in column 4 (see fig. 8 caption for details). If the first appearance of the foraminifer Globivalvulina bulloides is used as a guide to the base of the Pennsylvanian in our section, the midCarboniferous boundary would be 13 m lower than the conodont-based boundary but would still not match other levels determined by Mamet using his own zonation (foraminiferan analysis by PL. Brenckle, Amoco Production Company, written commun., 1991). Sylvie Pinard (Geological Survey of Canada) analyzed the foraminifers (written commun., 1991) in the same thin sections as those examined by PL. Brenckle and placed the boundary 9 m higher than his determination (fig. 8; 4 m below the conodontbased boundary).

The last appearance of the foraminifer Brenckleina rugosa may be an additional guide to the midCarboniferous boundary in the Cordillera of the conterminous United States where the species disappears at, or slightly above, the base of the Pennsylvanian and before the first occurrence of Globivalvulina (Brenckle and others, 1982). At the study section (fig. 8), however, B. rugosa extends at least 25 m above the first appearance of D. noduliferus and 38 m above the first Globivalvulina (PL. Brenckle, written commun., 1991).
It is obvious that taxonomic interpretations, biostratigraphic models, and paleobiogeography, as well as spacing and selection of foraminifer and conodont samples, control boundary placements. As taxonomic interpretations stabilize and global biostratigraphic data increase for both foraminifers and conodonts, correlations should improve the usefulness these groups separately and in concert.
MORROWAN-ATOKAN BOUNDARY
The foraminiferan zonation of Mamet and Skipp (1970) has been used extensively to correlate the Lisburne Group and to approximate the position of the standard North American Midcontinent series boundaries within it. Armstrong and Mamet (1977, p. 18) place the base of the Atokan Series at the boundary between foraminiferan Zones 20 and 21. They define the base of Zone 21 as the "outburst of abundant Eoschubertella, Pseudostaffella, and Globivalvulina of the group G. bulloides.'" Groves (1986) also uses Eoschubertella and (or) Pseudostaffella to define the base of the Atokan in the southern Midcontinent and Cordillera of the conterminous United States and to approximate this boundary in northeast Alaska. Sutherland and Manger (1984b) recommended that the base of the Atokan Series in the southern Midcontinent be marked by the appearance of the foraminifer Eoschubertella spp. and the conodont Diplognathodus spp.
Diplognathodusl was found in only one sample in our section (pi. 5, figs. 18, 19; pi. 6; table 1) and is rare in the Lisburne Group in northern Alaska. Moreover, the proposal to use Diplognathodus as a guide to the base of the Atokan preceded the recognition of Morrowan diplognathodids (von Bitter and Merrill, 1990). For now, Diplognathodusl orphanus appears to be the only known diplognathodid restricted to the Atokan. Consequently, other conodonts or groups are needed to identify rocks of Atokan age. Grayson (1990) and Whiteside and Grayson (1990), in their revision of Idiognathodus sinuosus, I. klapperi, and /. incurvus, suggest that the appearance of /. incurvus indicates an Atokan or slightly younger Pennsylvanian age in the southern Midcontinent, including the type area of the Atokan. Additionally, /. incurvus probably overlaps the upper range of its ancestor /. klapperi within the lower Atokan (Grayson and others, 1989). We were unable to confirm the phylogeny

CONODONT BIOFACIES

proposed by Grayson and his co-workers. Nearly all of the idiognathodids recovered from our section are either too poorly preserved for specific identification or are representatives of the long-ranging species, /. sinuosus. Two specimens of /. incurvus? were identified. The first appearance of /. sinuosus in the study section is probably unrelated to its origin and could represent any level within the lower part of its stratigraphic range. The occurrence of /. incurvus? with Rhachistognathus minutus subspp. suggests an age no younger than early Atokan for the uppermost part of the Wahoo Limestone in the study section.
Foraminiferan data suggest that the first appearance of Idiognathodus sinuosus in the study section is within the Atokan (figs. 7, 8). The foraminiferan guides to the Atokan, Pseudostaffella and Eoschubertella, first appear 16 m and 12m, respectively, below /. sinuosus (171 and 175 m above the base of the Wahoo Limestone, P.L. Brenckle, written commun., 1991). Furthermore, Plectostaffella, the ancestor of Pseudostaffella, first appears 14 m below its descendant (157 m above the base of the Wahoo Limestone) and continues to 183 m above the base of the Wahoo Limestone. Plectostaffella is unknown in North America except from northern Alaska (Groves, 1986, 1988). The sudden appearance of its descendant, Pseudostaffella, at the base of the Atokan in the North American Midcontinent indicates its migration from the Eurasian-Arctic Faunal Realm to the Midcontinent-Andean Faunal Realm (Groves, 1988). Thus, Pseudostaffella probably is not a reliable guide to the base of the Atokan in northern Alaska. The base of the Atokan could lie at some level between the first appearance of Pseudostaffella and /. incurvus!. Figures 7 and 8 show the relative position of the lower boundary of the Atokan on the basis of conodonts versus foraminifers. A third fossil group may be needed to distinguish evolutionary from migratory patterns in foraminifers and conodonts.
CONODONT BIOFACIES
The distribution of conodonts was chiefly controlled by the physical and chemical characteristics of the water mass and its trophic resources and, on a grander scale, by paleogeography. These factors influence biostratigraphic analyses because most zonation is based on first appearances. Thus, the presence or absence of a species is not only related to evolution but also to a wide range of paleogeographic, paleoenvironmental, and postmortem factors (Merrill and von Bitter, 1976; Rexroad and Horowitz, 1990; Pohler and Barnes, 1990).
Studies that are useful for conodont biofacies analysis of the Wahoo Limestone include Webster (1969), Merrill (1973a), Merrill and Martin (1976), Merrill and von Bitter (1976, 1979, 1984), Driese and others (1984), Davis and Webster (1985), Wilson (1985), Sweet (1988), Rexroad and Horowitz (1990), and Morrow and Webster (1991, 1992).

Of these, Davis and Webster (1985) and Morrow and Web-

ster (1991, 1992) best approximate the age, paleoenviron-

mental conditions, and species associations found in the

Wahoo Limestone. Davis and Webster (1985) proposed four conodont biofacies for middle Carboniferous, shallow-

water, carbonate-shelf deposits in central Montana:

Declinognathodus-Idiognathoides,

Rhachistognathus,

Adetognathus, and Neognathodus biofacies. Morrow and

Webster (1991) recognized only the Rhachistognathus and

Adetognathus biofacies in offshore barrier-shoal and nearshore-lagoon environments through the mid-

Carboniferous boundary interval in the Ely Limestone of

west-central Utah. All but the Neognathodus biofacies have

been recognized, with some modifications, in the Wahoo

Limestone. According to Davis and Webster (1985), the

Declinognathodus-Idiognathoides

biofacies

(=

Idiognathodus-Streptognathodus biofacies of Merrill,

1973a, and Merrill and von Bitter, 1976, 1979) represents

an offshore, shallow, open-marine environment. The Rha-

chistognathus biofacies represents a higher energy regime

that is associated with shoals transitional between the open-

platform and open-marine environments (see fig. 10C). The Adetognathus biofacies (= Cavusgnathus biofacies of Mer-

rill and von Bitter, 1976, 1979) occupies the open- to

restricted-platform area behind a shoal, an area of variable

salinities represented by a variety of lithologies.

Like Morrow and Webster (1991, 1992), we relied on

regional stratigraphic relationships, field observations, such

as stratigraphic sequence and bedding characteristics, and,

most heavily, on microlithofacies to confirm and constrain

conodont paleoenvironmental interpretations.

CONODONT BIOFACIES AND ASSOCIATED MICROLITHOFACIES, WAHOO LIMESTONE,
EASTERN SADLEROCHIT MOUNTAINS
Conodont biofacies and depositional environments of the Wahoo Limestone in the eastern Sadlerochit Mountains are intermediate between those presented by Davis and Webster (1985) and Morrow and Webster (1991, 1992) for sections in Montana and Utah. Rhachistognathus and Adetognathus, however, are distributed across a wider range of depositional environments in the Wahoo Limestone. This probably resulted from hydraulic mixing of conodont elements from adjacent environments during periodic highenergy conditions on the Wahoo carbonate platform. The predominance of grainstone (65 percent, including oolitic grainstone) in the Wahoo indicates deposition on the shallow inner part of a carbonate ramp. Lacking reefal barriers, carbonate ramps are particularly susceptible to reworking and redistribution of sediment by waves and storm surges (Oslenger, 1991). Conodont elements in our section are commonly abraded, further evidence of hydraulic transport.

22 CONODONT BIOSTRATIGRAPHY AND BIOFACIES OF THE WAHOO LIMESTONE

Our data are from 72 samples. Initially, samples were collected at about 5-m intervals. Subsequently, intervals containing important biostratigraphic boundaries and (or) few conodonts were resampled at closer spacing. Because the main focus of this study was biostratigraphic, some lithologies, representing environments unfavorable for conodonts, were avoided. For example, rocks representing restricted-marine and oolitic and oncolitic shoal environments were not sampled initially. After preliminary biostratigraphic analysis, however, even rocks known or inferred to be unfavorable for conodont recovery were collected near lithostratigraphic and biostratigraphic boundaries. None of these samples were devoid of conodonts, but predictably, they produced few if any biostratigraphically significant species and, even worse, too few for biofacies analysis (for example, tables 1 and 2; 62-80.8 m and 167182 m above the base of the Wahoo Limestone). Consequently, 26 samples could not be used for biofacies analysis. Ten of these contain common to abundant peloids and (or) spicules, and another 12 contain common to abundant ooids, superficial ooids, and (or) oncoids. Five samples that contain common but not abundant ooids, superficial ooids, and (or) oncoids did qualify for biofacies analysis. The positive aspect of these largely negative results is that most of our prejudices about "offensive" rock types were reinforced, but, in a few cases, we learned not to suggest depositional environments using minimal conodont data (see table 2, samples not qualifying for biofacies analysis).
Only generically identifiable conodonts, including all apparatus elements, were used for biofacies analysis. Samples with fewer than 20 elements identifiable to genus and genera represented by less than 5 elements were not used for analysis. Cavusgnathusl tytthus, listed separately on table 2, is combined with cavusgnathids in Mississippian collections and adetognathids in Pennsylvanian collections. Following Ziegler and Sandberg (1990), conodont biofacies are designated using the name of one or two generic components that make up about 70 percent of the fauna. If the two most abundant genera do not reach this percentage, the conodont association is, with some exceptions, considered the result of postmortem hydraulic transport, bioturbation, and (or) unfortunate sampling. Although most of the samples analyzed show evidence of some hydraulic transport and mixing, those dominated by one or two genera are interpreted to represent a living association or an association derived from laterally adjacent environments.
For the most part, biofacies are closely related to specific paleoenvironments. In some instances, however, the associated biota and (or) degree of abrasion of conodonts and grain types influenced environmental interpretations (table 2). Biofacies and microlimofacies environmental analyses agree in general but may differ in some details.
Paleoenvironments (fig. 9) were interpreted from regional and local and vertical and lateral stratigraphic relationships, bedding characteristics, sedimentary structures,

carbonate lithology (megascopic and microscopic textural classification of Dunham, 1962), carbonate grain types, and fossil assemblages. The data set for this study is given in tables 1 and 2 and plate 6.
MISSISSIPPIAN PART OF THE WAHOO LIMESTONE
Regional relationships suggest that the Mississippian part of the lower member of the Wahoo Limestone was deposited in a predominantly open-platform to open-marine setting. Three major environments were sampled in this part of the section: (1) near-restricted open platform4 to open platform, (2) moderate- to high-energy (above wave base) open marine, and (3) low-energy (below wave base) open marine. The general characteristics and paleogeographic setting of each are given in figure 9.
CAVUSGNATHID BIOFACIES
NEAR-RESTRICTED TO OPEN-PLATFORM ENVIRONMENTS
Six collections from the Mississippian part of the lower member of the Wahoo Limestone represent the cavusgnathid biofacies. The samples are from moderate- to well-sorted bryozoan grainstone, commonly containing fenestrate bryozoans and fewer pelmatozoans. Minor to rare grains include peloids, intraclasts, and bioclasts of algae, foraminifers, brachiopods, gastropods, and trilobites (table 2). Macrofossils, which are typically incomplete, occur as abraded and commonly micritized bioclasts. Beds are generally massive, bioturbated and, where preserved, parallel bedded. Grainstones are better washed and slightly coarser grained than those in the adjacent, lower energy cavusgnathid-kladognathid biofacies. A seventh collection qualified for biofacies analysis (table 1, USGS colln. 31698-PC) but could not be included here because no microlithofacies sample was saved.
Conodonts are rare (<10/kg) to common (10-25/kg) and average 11/kg in this biofacies. Only 43 percent of the conodonts, however, are generically determinate, and ramiform elements are rarely identifiable to genus or even element type reflecting a relatively high-energy regime. Most smaller and lighter elements were probably carried into nearby lower energy regimes.
Cavusgnathus, dominantly C. unicornis, makes up 69 to 100 percent, averaging 84 percent, of all conodonts from this biofacies (fig. 10A); C.I tytthus makes up less than 4 percent of the cavusgnathids. Kladognathus and Gnathodus average 9 and 2 percent, respectively, and hindeodids, lochrieids, and rhachistognathids, together, make up less than 5 percent of conodonts from this biofacies. One sample

contains 12 percent Vogelgnathus and 11 percent Rhachistognathus (table 1, 13.2 m above the base of the Wahoo Limestone). The presence of rhachistognathids is compatible with the high-energy, well-sorted microlithofacies interpretation. All other collections from this biofacies are from moderately sorted, lower energy grainstones and lack rhachistognathids.

Cavusgnathus dominated this and, less commonly, adjacent offshore environments. Most other genera were minor components of the population and (or) postmortem additions. We have not been able to identify the ecologic preference of Vogelgnathus in the study section because of its scarcity. Elsewhere, this genus is associated with restricted marine environments (Purnell and von Bitter,

1992). Most of the rocks in our section that might represent the habitat of Vogelgnathus were either not sampled or formed in moderate- to high-energy regimes from which the small skeletal elements of Vogelgnathus were probably winnowed. Vogelgnathus is abundant in a poorly washed peloidal grainstone containing minor echinoderm debris and spicules.
The conodont species association and taphonomy suggest that the cavusgnathid biofacies occupied a nearrestricted to moderate-energy open-platform setting. The predominance of Cavusgnathus strongly favors a nearshore, relatively variable environment (Merrill and von Bitter, 1976, 1979). In addition, minor kladognathids and rare hindeodids, gnathodids, and lochrieids support an openplatform rather than an open-marine interpretation.
The Mississippian part of the lower member of the Wahoo Limestone formed during the early phase of a major TR sequence. Initially, circulation and depositional patterns were not well established so that shoal facies and associated environmental partitioning are absent. Without intervening shoals, the depositional setting (open platform versus open marine) of fossiliferous packstones and grainstones cannot be reliably interpreted. Microlithofacies and conodontbased interpretations of the environmental setting for samples from the cavusgnathid biofacies differ. The overwhelming dominance of Cavusgnathus and the virtual absence of open-marine conodont species point to an opento near-restricted platform environment. In contrast, microlithofacies favor a moderate- to high-energy, openmarine or open-platform environment containing a diverse marine fauna. We believe that the conodonts favor the open-platform interpretation because of the low-diversity conodont fauna.
CAVUSGNATHID-KLADOGNATHID BIOFACIES
OPEN-PLATFORM TO OPEN-MARINE ENVIRONMENT
Five samples from the lower 37 m of the Wahoo Limestone contain subequal mixtures of Cavusgnathus and Kladognathus. These samples are primarily from moderately sorted grainstone and poorly sorted packstone that contain

bryozoans and pelmatozoans, minor peloids, and rare intraclasts. Other bioclasts include minor algae, brachiopods, sponge spicules, and foraminifers and rare gastropods, calcispheres, and ostracodes (table 2). Grains are moderately abraded and variably micritized. The rocks are less well sorted and slightly finer grained than those of the cavusgnathid biofacies. Massive bedding may have resulted from extensive bioturbation, indicating oxygenated bottom waters and (or) low sedimentation rates. Bryozoans and pelmatozoans probably lived within or near this environment, indicating normal-marine conditions. Mud-rich laminae and burrow fills commonly contain peloids, spicules, and (or) ostracodes that indicate partial derivation from adjacent restricted-platform environments. The three samples in the lower 7 m of the Wahoo Limestone are packstone and grainstone-packstone interbedded with dolomitic spiculitic mudstone; this association of lithologies further indicates proximity to low-energy, intermittently-restricted platform environments.
Samples from the cavusgnathid-kladognathid biofacies contain relatively abundant conodonts (26/kg), but about 60 percent are generically indeterminate fragments, suggesting considerable postmortem movement. Many elements, including ramiforms, are complete; thus, postmortem movement was probably within this and (or) from nearby biofacies.
Four samples from the open-platform to open-marine environment contain 40 to 57 percent Cavusgnathus unicornis, 21 to 40 percent Kladognathus spp., and 9 to 24 percent Gnathodus girtyi. Rhachistognathus, chiefly R. muricatus, makes up as much as 9 percent of two samples and idioprioniodids, lochrieids, and vogelgnathids together make up less than 5 percent (table 1). Cavusgnathus probably lived within this environment, but many elements may have been transported from the adjacent higher energy cavusgnathid biofacies (fig. 10/4). The ecologic preference of Cavusgnathus for nearshore, relatively variable environments (Merrill and von Bitter, 1976, 1979) is consistent with its distribution in the Wahoo Limestone. Kladognathus also lived in this environment, as nearly all the components of its apparatus are present (table 1). The percentage of Kladognathus diminishes rapidly shoreward toward the cavusgnathid biofacies (fig. 10A). Gnathodus girtyi may have lived in this environment in low to moderate numbers. Most of our specimens, however, are incomplete and poorly preserved suggesting postmortem transport from the more offshore gnathodid-hindeodid biofacies (fig. 10A). During this time interval, Gnathodus girtyi subspp. is the dominant gnathodid in collections from normal-marine, relatively shallow-water deposits in the Brooks Range and elsewhere in the Cordillera of the United States (unpub. USGS collections). This species had a variety of ecophenotypes (included here in G. g. simplex) that successfully competed in shallow water. Rhachistognathids, in addition to other genera that make up less than 5 percent of the conodonts

26 CONODONT BIOSTRATIGRAPHY AND BIOFACIES OF THE WAHOO LIMESTONE

from this environment, are considered postmortem admixtures. Rhachistognathids were probably transported from nearby higher energy regimes as representatives of the genus generally occupy near-shoal and shoal-water environments.
A sample from 37 m above the base of the Wahoo Limestone contains conodonts of the cavusgnathidkladognathid biofacies and represents an open-marine environment. Cavusgnathus and Kladognathus are equally abundant (36 percent) and gnathodids make up 27 percent of the faunule, a higher proportion than other samples in this biofacies. On the basis of conodonts, we would interpret the environment as open platform or possibly open marine. Microlithofacies suggest an open-marine to openplatform, moderate-energy environment, but the low diversity and absence of shallow-water grain types favor the open-marine setting. The gnathodids and grain types together with slightly muddier lithologies convinced us to extend the cavusgnathid-kladognathid biofacies into the open-marine environment.
GNATHODID-HINDEODID BIOFACIES
LOW-ENERGY, OPEN-MARINE ENVIRONMENT
This biofacies is represented by a single sample (53 m above the base of the Wahoo Limestone) that is the youngest Mississippian collection used for analysis from the formation (table 2). It is from a poorly sorted bryozoan packstone containing common pelmatozoan, ramose bryozoan, and brachiopod fragments, minor quartz grains, and rare bioclasts of foraminifers, trilobites, and algae. Microlithofacies indicate a low-energy, open-marine environment (table 2 and fig. 9).
Conodonts are relatively common (15/kg); 50 percent are generically determinate, and many elements are complete. We believe that Gnathodus (63 percent) and Hindeodus (32 percent) were living in and probably seaward of this environment, as these forms are rare or absent in adjacent shoreward biofacies (fig. 10/4). Hindeodus minutus (Ellison), the only hindeodid recovered from the Wahoo Limestone, is a long-ranging (latest Chesterian to at least Early Permian), cosmopolitan species that is generally a persistent component in samples from most normal-marine environments. The gnathodids are represented chiefly by Gnathodus girtyi simplex and G. g. girtyi (in a ratio of 3:2); rare, but biostratigraphically significant G. girtyi simplex transitional to Declinognathodus noduliferus as well as G. bilineatus bilineatus also occur. The species association and the absence of nearshore conodont species confirm the microlithofacies interpretation of a below-wave-base, openmarine depositional setting (fig. 10/4). This sample represents maximum transgression during deposition of the lower member of the Wahoo Limestone.

PENNSYLVANIAN PART OF THE WAHOO LIMESTONE
The maximum transgression in the latest Mississippian, represented by open-marine deposits that formed below wave base (fig. 10/4), was followed by rapid shallowing in the earliest Pennsylvanian. Locally, uppermost Mississippian deposits were subaerially and (or) subaqueously eroded as evidenced by paleotopography beneath an exposure surface (local preburial banded caliche, Watts, 1990; fig. 6). Rare, redeposited latest Mississippian conodonts occur in basal Pennsylvanian deposits above this disconformity (table 1). Depositional patterns were more complex in the Pennsylvanian than in the Mississippian. The lowest part of the Pennsylvanian, however, is generally similar to the Mississippian because it lacks the ooid grainstones that typify the upper member of the Wahoo Limestone. Additionally, the upper member contains shorter and more numerous shallowing-upward cycles, as reflected in its characteristic ledge-and-slope topography (fig. 5).
The maximum duration of regression in the Wahoo Limestone is apparently not at the MississippianPennsylvanian boundary but is 14 m higher at the contact between the lower and upper members of the formation (fig. 4). Redeposited Mississippian conodonts are more prevalent immediately below the contact, the shallowest water deposits in the Wahoo Limestone occur immediately above the contact, and quartz increases from an average of 3 to at least 12 percent in the lower 20 m of the upper member. All these features indicate significant regression and some exposure and erosion of older deposits. The duration of this possible disconformity is unknown; it may be as short as a diastem or as long as most of the Morrowan.
Six depositional environments—intertidal, restricted platform, open platform, shoal, tidal channel, and open marine—are recognized in the Pennsylvanian part of the Wahoo Limestone. The general characteristics and paleogeographic setting of each are given in figure 9. Rocks representing the intertidal environment were not sampled for conodonts.
Greatly influencing conodont biofacies in the upper member of the Wahoo Limestone is the ooid facies that makes up 20 percent of the member. This high-energy regime caused many conodont elements, particularly rhachistognathids, to be transported beyond their biofacies, substantially disrupting and even obliterating original biofacies patterns. Consequently, some samples representing the same environment, as interpreted from microlithofacies and stratigraphic relationships, produce significantly different relative abundance of conodont genera. Postmortem mixing of conodonts eradicated some biofacies and artificially created others.

LOWER MEMBER OF THE WAHOO LIMESTONE
ADETOGNATHID-RELATED BIOFACIES
NEAR-RESTRICTED TO OPEN-PLATFORM ENVIRONMENT
Two samples from the Pennsylvanian part of the lower member of the Wahoo Limestone represent an adetognathid-declinognathodid biofacies (table 2). The first is from 56 m above the base of the Wahoo Limestone and is an interlaminated peloidal packstone-wackestone and moderately sorted bryozoan-pelmatozoan grainstone; this mixture of lithologies suggests hydraulic mixing of open- and restricted-platform grain types. The second is from 59 m above the base of the Wahoo Limestone and is a moderately sorted bryozoan grainstone-packstone containing common bioclasts of brachiopods and pelmatozoans and rare algae, foraminifers, trilobites, and peloids. The microlithofacies suggest a moderate-energy, open-marine setting.
Conodonts are relatively common in the adetognathiddeclinognathodid biofacies (13/kg); 50 percent are generically indeterminate indicating considerable postmortem transport. Adetognathids and Cavusgnathus? tytthus, together, account for 35 to 58 percent of the conodonts in this biofacies. Adetognathids are a long-ranging (latest Chesterian to Early Permian), relatively shallow-water, eurytopic group that is a common to abundant component of all our Pennsylvanian faunas. The group was competitively successful in partly restricted and (or) variable environments. Cavusgnathus? tytthus is relatively abundant (22-35 percent) in the adetognathid-declinognathodid biofacies. It is a relatively rare, short-ranging, latest Mississippian and very earliest Pennsylvanian species in the northeast Brooks Range. Consequently, it is restricted to the lower 20.5 m of the Pennsylvanian part of our section. The species is known only from the northeast Brooks Range, western Utah, and its type area in the Illinois basin. It appears to extend from nearshore, possibly intermittently restricted environments that typify the inner margins of intracratonic basins to the shallower part of the openplatform environment. Its presence in open-marine environments may be chiefly a consequence of postmortem hydraulic transport (fig. 105). In the adetognathiddeclinognathodid biofacies, it occurs with Declinognathodus noduliferus japonicus. Declinognathodus noduliferus is a cosmopolitan species that has a variety of ecophenotypes. We assume that the most nodose form (D. n. japonicus) occupied shallower and more variable environments than the more delicately ornamented D. n. inaequalis. Indeed, D. n. japonicus makes up about 90 percent of the declinognathodids in this relatively shallow-water biofacies.
Rhachistognathids are few in the Pennsylvanian part of the lower member of the Wahoo Limestone because their principal habitat, the shoal-water environment, was rare (fig. 105). Rhachistognathus muricatus, virtually the only rhachistognathid in this part of the Wahoo Limestone,

makes up 8 to 21 percent of the conodont assemblage in the two samples from the adetognathid-declinognathodid biofacies. This species is morphologically variable, a characteristic of conodonts that are successful in a variety of shallow-water environments.
LOW-ENERGY, OPEN-MARINE ENVIRONMENT
A single sample of bryozoan packstone containing common pelmatozoans, minor brachiopods and bivalves, and rare bioclasts of foraminifers, gastropods, sponge spicules, and trilobites produced conodonts of the hindeodidadetognathid biofacies (tables 1, 2; 69 m above the base of the Wahoo Limestone). The microlithofacies indicates a low-energy open-marine environment. Although the sample qualifies for biofacies analysis, the species association suggests a mixed assemblage. It is likely that Hindeodus minutus occupied this environment as all elements of its apparatus are present. This species is long ranging and consistently appears in rocks representing the relatively deeper depositional settings of the Wahoo Limestone (figs. 10A, B). This biofacies may represent the outer limit of the Cavusgnathus? tytthus and adetognathid habitats. More likely, these forms are hydraulic admixtures. In addition, rhachistognathids (18 percent) were probably carried here from their shallow-water high-energy habitat.
UPPER MEMBER OF THE WAHOO LIMESTONE
ADETOGNATHID-RHACHISTOGNATHID BIOFACIES
RESTRICTED TO NEAR OPEN-PLATFORM ENVIRONMENT
Restricted platform conditions were prominent near the base and top of the upper member of the Wahoo Limestone when shoals had migrated farther south. Six samples from the upper member were collected from restricted- to near open-platform environments as determined by field observations and microlithofacies (table 2).
Only two samples from the least restricted part of this environment qualified for biofacies analysis. These produced nearly equal numbers of adetognathids and rhachistognathids. One (246 m above the base of the Wahoo Limestone) is a peloidal grainstone containing common quartz and minor bioclasts of pelmatozoans, brachiopods, foraminifers, sponge spicules, ostracodes, and calcispheres. The other, at 261.5 m, is spiculitic mudstone containing common peloids, oncoids, and a variety of bioclasts. Conodonts in these collections represent either the edge of the rhachistognathid-adetognathid biofacies or, more likely, storm-tossed skeletons, stranded voyagers, or fecal droppings.
Four samples from the restricted platform did not qualify for biofacies analysis; their microlithofacies are listed in table 2. The conodonts that occur in these samples were

28 CONODONT BIOSTRATIGRAPHY AND BIOFACIES OF THE WAHOO LIMESTONE

probably derived from the adjacent open-platform environment that hosted the rhachistognathid-adetognathid biofacies (fig. 10C).

rhachistognathid-dominated shoal or tidal channel environment on figure 10C.

OPEN-PLATFORM TO NEAR-SHOAL OPEN-PLATFORM ENVIRONMENTS
Five samples from the adetognathid-rhachistognathid biofacies occur in a variety of open-platform subenvironments (table 2; 84, 118, 157, 203, 241 m above the base of the Wahoo Limestone). These are variously sorted grainstones and one moderately sorted grainstone-packstone. These rocks contain locally abundant bryozoans or pelmatozoans, as well as a variety of bioclasts such as brachiopods, gastropods, and algae. Peloids, ooids, superficial ooids, oncoids, and intraclasts are common in several samples and grains are commonly micritized (table 2). Donezella algae are common to minor in two samples.
Conodonts are rare (6/kg) in these samples. About 50 percent are generically determinate, most are incomplete Pa elements, and some are abraded. Many, particularly the rhachistognathids, were probably transported from the adjacent, higher energy, shoal-water environment. Adetognathus forms 40 to 54 percent of the assemblage in open-platform settings and shoal aprons. It probably lived in these settings as its relative abundance generally decreases seaward (fig. 10C). Although rhachistognathids make up about half the conodonts in open-platform to near-shoal deposits, they become even more abundant shoalward. We cannot distinguish postmortem admixtures from in situ specimens but suspect that a high percentage represent the former. Collections from this biofacies are remarkably free of other genera. This may be the natural species association or an artifice of winnowing and breakage. Both the microlithofacies and the low diversity of conodonts favor an openplatform to near-shoal interpretation.
TIDAL-CHANNEL(?) ENVIRONMENT

RHACHISTOGNATHID BIOFACIES
Rhachistognathids are the most abundant conodonts in a variety of high-energy environments including shoal and shoal aprons in open-platform and open-marine settings. The association of rhachistognathids and lesser adetognathids suggests a near-shoal, open-platform setting, particularly if the adetognathids are relatively intact. In shoal to tidal-channel environments, the number of rhachistognathids is generally much greater in the adjacent shoal aprons (table 2). If typically open-marine forms, such as declinognathodids or idiognathodids, occur with abundant rhachistognathids and are nearly as common as adetognathids, we favor a near-shoal, open-marine setting.
NEAR-SHOAL, OPEN-PLATFORM ENVIRONMENT
Three samples (table 2; 95, 107, and 257.5 m above the base of the Wahoo Limestone) from the rhachistognathid biofacies referred to this environment contain adetognathids as virtually the only other conodonts. Poorly to well-sorted grainstone-packstone to grainstone contain a variety of common to minor bioclasts (bryozoans, pelmatozoans, foraminifers, oncoids, and algae) and ooids, superficial ooids, peloids, and intraclasts. Conodonts are relatively common (12/kg); 73 percent are identifiable to genus. The abundant rhachistognathids (71-80 percent) indicate a relatively high-energy shoal to near-shoal environment. The virtual absence of conodonts other than adetognathids (20-29 percent) favors a back-shoal setting. Environmental interpretations, based on microlithofacies, generally match the conodont-based interpretations. These three samples are plotted with the adetognathid-rhachistognathid openplatform to near-shoal biofacies on figure 10C.

One sample of very well sorted grainstone containing common highly abraded bioclasts of foraminifers, bryozoans, and ostracodes and minor peloids, quartz, and other bioclasts including algae suggests a high-energy, openplatform to open-marine setting, possibly a tidal channel (table 2; 113m above the base of the Wahoo Limestone). It produced 66 and 31 percent rhachistognathids and adetognathids, respectively. The abundance of rhachistognathids suggests a high-energy regime, either a shoal or tidalchannel setting. The species association favors a tidalchannel or near-shoal open-platform environment because adetognathids are abundant and other conodonts are rare. In combination, biofacies and microlithofacies data favor a tidal-channel setting. This sample is plotted in the

SHOAL OR TIDAL-CHANNEL ENVIRONMENTS
High-energy shoal or tidal-channel environments include oolitic-rich and skeletal-rich grainstones. Although no tidal channels were distinguished in the field, some conodont and microlithofacies samples produce a well-sorted mixture of grains derived from open-platform, openmarine, and shoal environments that are compatible with a tidal-channel setting.
Five samples qualifying for biofacies analysis are from massive-bedded, very well to well-sorted grainstone containing mixtures of common to minor bioclasts (foraminifers, bryozoans, pelmatozoans, algae, brachiopods, and bivalves), ooids, superficial ooids, peloids, intraclasts, and

CONODONT BIOFACIES

quartz (table 2). Conodonts are common (21/kg) and remarkably well preserved; 67 percent are generically determinate suggesting the conodonts lived in and (or) adjacent to shoal and tidal-channel environments.
Rhachistognathids overwhelmingly dominate the shoal and tidal-channel environments, making up 73 to 90 percent of the collections. In the upper member of the Wahoo Limestone, this group is probably as diverse as in any other succession thus far described (for example, Baesemann and Lane, 1985). Specimens are abundant and extremely robust. If Rhachistognathus tninutus had been first described from the Wahoo, its trivial name would have been gigantus. The rhachistognathids include, in order of decreasing abundance, R. muricatus, R. minutus subspp., and R. websteri. The two lowest samples are dominated by R. muricatus, the next higher two by R. websteri, and the stratigraphically highest by R. minutus subspp. Species of Rhachistognathus probably occupied different areas of the shoal and tidalchannel environments. The replacement of R. muricatus by R. websteri and subsequent replacement of R. websteri by R. minutus subspp. generally parallel a major transgression and the concomitant expansion of shoal facies in the upper member of the Wahoo Limestone. The same species succession is found at similar stratigraphic levels in the near-shoal open-platform environment (see tables 1 and 2). Morphologically, R. muricatus and R. websteri are more variable than R. minutus subspp., likely reflecting their adaptation to variable environments. Rhachistognathus minutus subspp. first appears in the study section 14 m above the base of the upper member and eventually replaces other rhachistognathids as the dominant species in environments favorable for the genus. The more uniform and symmetrical morphology of R. minutus subspp. suggests its adaptation to more uniform, normal-marine environments. Indeed, R. minutus subspp. is the dominant rhachistognathid in seaward settings.
Adetognathids, the only other group common to the shoal and tidal-channel environments, make up 10 to 27 percent of the collections. Their relative abundance does not appear to correlate well with any particular species of Rhachistognathus. The adetognathids are probably migrants and (or) hydraulic admixtures from the open platform. Virtually no other conodonts occur in this biofacies in these environments (table 1).
NEAR-SHOAL, OPEN-MARINE ENVIRONMENT
Three samples from the rhachistognathid biofacies are attributed to this environment (table 2). One sample (133.5 m above the base of the Wahoo Limestone) is from moderately sorted, bryozoan grainstone containing common pelmatozoans and a variety of minor bioclasts, peloids, intraclasts, and quartz. Conodonts are abundant (34/kg); 62 percent are generically determinate. They include

rhachistognathids (77 percent), adetognathids (14 percent), and declinognathodids (9 percent). The rhachistognathids indicate proximity to a high-energy environment, and the declinognathodids suggest a position seaward of a shoal or tidal channel. Microlithofacies also suggest a near-shoal, open-marine setting, but of moderate energy (table 2). An open-marine shoal apron seems appropriate for a faunule dominated by cosmopolitan Rhachistognathus minutus subspp. The second sample (at 232 m) is a well-sorted bryozoan grainstone containing common pelmatozoans and minor bioclasts of gastropods, oncoids, foraminifers, algae, bivalves, and brachiopods. Conodonts are relatively common (11/kg), and 43 percent are determinable to genus. These include rhachistognathids (54 percent), idiognathodids (23 percent), adetognathids (12 percent), and declinognathodids (10 percent). For convenience, this sample is included in the rhachistognathid biofacies even though rhachistognathids make up less than 70 percent of the faunule. Rhachistognathids indicate proximity to a high-energy environment. The declinognathodids and idiognathodids suggest open-marine conditions, and the adetognathids, in particular A. spathus, may indicate proximity to an openplatform high-energy regime. Taken together, this mix favors a near-shoal, open-marine setting, assuming some of the adetognathids are postmortem admixtures. Alternatively, declinognathodids may have been carried over the shoals and into the open platform. Microlithofacies support either interpretation. In the overall TR sequence of the upper member of the Wahoo Limestone, both samples occur at the transition from open-platform to shoal conditions, thus possibly favoring an open-platform interpretation. The high percentage of declinognathodids and idiognathodids influenced the choice of an open-marine near-shoal depositional environment.
A third collection, (187 m above the base of the Wahoo Limestone) contains the greatest number of Rhachistognathus minutus declinatus in our sample set and is questionably included in this environment. It is the most productive sample (5 I/kg) and yields 62 percent generically determinate conodonts. No other rhachistognathids occur in this sample; other conodonts include 10 percent declinognathodids and 3 percent each of idiognathodids and adetognathids. The association suggests an open-marine shoalapron to near-shoal environment. The collection is from a moderately sorted bryozoan grainstone interbedded with fine-grained foraminiferan packstone that could have formed in open-platform and (or) open-marine environments. Perhaps R. m. declinatus occupied the open-marine shoal apron. The unusual species association may have resulted from sampling two lithologies with bryozoan grainstone producing rhachistognathids and adetognathids and the deeper(?) water foraminiferan packstone supplying idiognathodids and declinognathodids.

30 CONODONT BIOSTRATIGRAPHY AND BIOFACIES OF THE WAHOO LIMESTONE

DECLINOGNATHODID-RELATED BIOFACIES
NEAR-SHOAL, OPEN-MARINE ENVIRONMENT
Two samples of moderately sorted bryozoan grainstone to packstone containing common pelmatozoans and minor brachiopod bioclasts and ooids produced a declinognathodid and declinognathodid-idiognathodid biofacies (table 2; 197.5 and 207 m above the base of the Wahoo Limestone). Conodonts are rare (6/kg); only 28 percent are generically determinate suggesting an abundant influx of fragments from high-energy environments. Declinognathodus noduliferus, chiefly D. n. noduliferus, is most abundant (62 percent), followed by idiognathodids (21 percent) and Rhachistognathus minutus declinatus (9 percent). The species association and microlithofacies suggest an openmarine, near-shoal depositional environment. Both samples are from strata that represent the maximum transgression during deposition of the upper part of the Wahoo Limestone.
One sample (table 2; 177 m above the base of the Wahoo Limestone) representing a declinognathodidrhachistognathid biofacies is from a poorly sorted grainstone that contains a variety of bioclasts (for example, algae, foraminifers, bryozoans, and oncoids) and peloids, ooids, superficial ooids, and intraclasts. Conodonts are rare (7/kg); 50 percent are generically determinate. Subequal numbers of Declinognathodus noduliferus noduliferus and Rhachistognathus minutus (chiefly R. m. declinatus} suggest a near-shoal, open-marine setting. The bioclasts and lithoclasts are a mix of open-platform (particularly several types of algae), shoal, and open-marine forms that might represent a tidal-channel in proximity to ooid shoals. The concdonts do not argue against this interpretation. This sample has been included in the shoal to tidal-channel environment on figure 10C.

poorly sorted packstone containing common bioclasts of bryozoans, pelmatozoans, and brachiopods and minor algae. Conodonts are rare to common (8-17/kg), and only 40 percent are generically determinate. The conodont species associations indicate a low-energy, open-marine environment; microlithofacies indicate the same environment for one sample (at 217.5 m) and an open-platform to openmarine environment for the other sample.
Microlithofacies and conodont biofacies of the final two samples indicate a low-energy, open-platform or open-marine depositional environment (table 2; 142 and 162 m above the base of the Wahoo Limestone). These are included in the low-energy open-marine environment on figure 10C. The lower sample is dolomitized packstone that contains common bryozoans and minor quartz and bioclasts of brachiopods and pelmatozoans. These constituents indicate a low-energy open-platform or open-marine environment. The conodont biofacies is equally ambiguous. Rhachistognathids (47 percent) suggest a relatively highenergy near-shoal or shoal setting; adetognathids (31 percent) suggest proximity to a back-shoal area, but declinognathodids (22 percent) favor a more open-marine setting. The sample could represent postmortem seaward transport of adetognathids and probably rhachistognathids into an open-marine habitat that contained low numbers of declinognathodids. Alternatively, the declinognathodids could have been transported to the open platform. The higher sample is a dolomitized packstone-wackestone containing some grains possibly derived from the open platform (minor peloids and quartz and rare ooids, spicules, and ostracodes). The conodonts are a mix of platform, shoal, and open-marine forms (29 percent adetognathids, 40 percent rhachistognathids, and 27 percent declinognathodids).
BIOFACIES SUMMARY

LOW-ENERGY. OPEN-PLATFORM AND (OR) OPEN-MARINE ENVIRONMENT
Seven samples produced declinognathodids with and without other associated open-marine and shallow-water genera (table 2). Three samples (table 2; 152, 178, and 250 m above the base of the Wahoo Limestone) indicate that the low-energy, open-marine environment supported only low numbers of declinognathodids (3/kg). The samples, from lowest to highest, are lime mudstone, poorly sorted packstone containing common bioclasts of bryozoans and pelmatozoans, and a dolomitized mudstone to wackestone. Microlithofacies and conodont biofacies both indicate an open-marine depositional environment.
Only two samples from the declinognathodid-related biofacies produced Declinognathodus noduliferus subspp. together with Idiognathodus sinuosus (table 2; 217.5 and 237 m above the base of the Wahoo Limestone). Both are

The Wahoo Limestone formed in chiefly openplatform, near-shoal, and open-marine environments on the shallow, inner part of a high-energy carbonate ramp. In the uppermost Mississippian and lowermost Pennsylvanian part of the Wahoo Limestone, shoal facies were uncommon so that open-platform and open-marine microlithofacies and conodont biofacies were not clearly separated. Grain types and, to a lesser extent, conodonts were hydraulically spread beyond their original settings making some environmental interpretations equivocal. The use of conodont biofacies and microfacies in concert clarifies some of these environmental ambiguities. In the upper member of the Wahoo Limestone, extensive ooid and skeletal shoal tracts separated open-marine and open-platform environments producing more distinct biofacies and diagnostic microlithofacies. Rhachistognathids thrived in and adjacent to the shoal facies. After death, many of their skeletal elements remained in place, however, a substantial number were

washed into surrounding environments, masking original species associations (see table 2). Similarly, mixing of carbonate grains obscures microlithofacies interpretations. The vertical succession of conodont biofacies substantiates our microlithofacies interpretations that indicate the upper part of the Wahoo Limestone formed in a TR sequence passing from restricted platform to shoals and, finally, back to restricted platform. Additional studies are needed to further integrate conodont biofacies and microlithofacies analyses.
CONODONT PRESERVATION AND CAI VALUES
Epstein and others (1977) and Rejebian and others (1987) demonstrated in controlled laboratory experiments that color alteration in conodonts is time and temperature dependent. These color changes were assigned color alteration indices (CAI) from 1 to 8. Conodonts visibly change from pale yellow to brown and black (CAIs 1 to 5) from 50° to 300°C as a result of carbonization of the trace amounts of organic matter sealed within a conodont element. Conodonts change from black to gray, opaque white, and finally crystal clear (CAIs 5 to 8) from 300° to >600°C as a result of loss of carbon and water of crystallization and recrystallization.
Conodonts altered during burial metamorphism have consistent CAI values, locally and regionally, that reflect depth and duration of burial; textural alteration related to burial thermal regimes does not generally begin until a CAI of 4.5 or greater. In contrast, conodonts recovered from contact-metamorphosed or hydrothermally altered rocks have a range of CAI values locally within an area and even within a single sample; these can be texturally unaltered to corroded and may be fractured or deformed. If a range of CAI values occurs in a small area, the minimum value is used to estimate the regional background (burial metamorphic) temperature (Rejebian and others, 1987). Significantly, CAI values of 6 and 7 can also be produced by relatively low-temperature saline solutions. These solutions corrode conodonts and oxidize their organic matter thereby producing CAI values of 6 and 7 that are unrelated to the thermal regimes that can also produce these values during burial and contact metamorphism (Rejebian and others, 1987; Harris and others, 1990). Characteristically, conodonts from hydrothermally altered rocks tend to have low to medium CAI values mixed with values of 6 and 7; CAI values of 5, 5.5, and 8 are generally absent.
CAI values in Ordovician through Permian rocks in the Sadlerochit Mountains range chiefly from 3 to 4 (Johnsson and others, 1992) suggesting that regional burial temperatures reached at least 150° to 200°C. None of the samples reported by them have CAI values greater than 4.5. Nine samples from a 102-m-thick section in the upper part of the Wahoo Limestone at Katakturuk River gorge (fig. 2,

loc. 2), about 40 km west of the study section, produced conodonts having consistent CAI values of 3 to 3.5 (app. 1, Iocs. 2a-j).
In the study section, 71 of 73 samples could be analyzed for CAI; two samples contain conodonts that were too few and (or) small for CAI analysis (table 1). CAI values of 3 to 4.5 and 6 were determined; no CAI values of 5 were observed. Most samples (96 percent) contain conodonts of CAI 4, but half of these have a mixture of CAI values (chiefly 4 and 6, rarely 3, and very rarely 3.5 and 4.5). In addition, most conodonts have a sugary and (or) corroded texture (many are coated with dolomite crystals; pi. 5, figs. 18, 19). The range of CAI values and textures suggest hydrothermal alteration of the Wahoo Limestone. A section 1 km west of the study section (fig. 2, loc. IBlb-e), produced CAIs of 4 and 6 in four samples taken immediately above the Mississippian-Pennsylvanian boundary.
What caused the anomalously "high" CAI 6 values in the study area? Nearly 50 percent of the samples produced some conodonts having a CAI of 6. About 60 percent of the anomalous samples are from grainstone or packstonegrainstone and another 30 percent are from a variety of dolomitized carbonate rocks. These data suggest positive correlation between anomalous CAI and rock porosity and permeability. However, not all grainstones or dolomitized carbonate rocks produced conodonts having anomalous CAIs. Some of the variability in CAI values could be related to occlusion of porosity and permeability by cements that formed prior to deposition of the Permian Echooka Formation (Watts, 1991). To date, the carbonatecement stratigraphy of the study section has not been analyzed. Carlson (1990) and Watts (1991), however, partly analyzed the carbonate-cement stratigraphy of a section 3 km to the southwest (fig. 2, loc. 1C) and found that most of the cements in the Wahoo Limestone formed prior to deposition of the Echooka Formation. But, post-Permian cements do form 20 to 80 percent of the cement in the lowermost 35 m of the Wahoo Limestone. Some of this porosity may have still been open for fluid migration during orogenesis. The anomalous CAI values, at least in the lower member at the study section, may have formed prior to or concurrently with these late-stage cements, but other intervals of anomalous CAIs may be related to still other factors. For example, fracture porosity (related to Late Cretaceous to Holocene regional orogenesis; Wallace and Hanks, 1990) undoubtedly influenced hydrothermal circulation patterns.
Two intervals in our section lack conodonts having anomalous CAIs: (1) an interval from 69 to 97 m above the base of the Wahoo Limestone that approximates the quartzrich lower part of the upper member of the formation and (2) a 10-m-thick interval at the top of the upper member containing a higher than average percentage of undolomitized spiculitic mudstone and wackestone. These data suggest a negative correlation between anomalously high CAI values and mixed mineralogy or poorly washed

32 CONODONT BIOSTRATIGRAPHY AND BIOFACIES OF THE WAHOO LIMESTONE

deposits; such rock types tend to have low porosity and permeability. Much of the above data suggest that the anomalous CAT values of 6 were produced by hydrothermal solutions (probably low-temperature saline solutions) moving through relatively permeable channelways and possibly elevating CAIs no more than one index value (from 3 to 3.5 or 4), as well as corroding and bleaching some specimens to produce CAIs of 6. Additional samples from the uppermost part of the Alapah Limestone at the study section are severely bleached and corroded and approximate a CAT of 7, suggesting increased alteration at this level. Watts (1990) also noted that porous dolostones and spar-filled caverns in the upper part of the Alapah Limestone probably acted as channelways for hydrothermal fluids. The hydrothermal alteration occurred after the early Atokan, most likely after the Permian. It is probably related to Brookian orogenesis and occurred after maximum burial metamorphism that elevated CAT values to 3 or 3.5 in Carboniferous and Permian rocks.
SYSTEMATIC PALEONTOLOGY
We have used the element notation summarized by Sweet (1988, fig. 2.10). Most of the generically and specifically determinate specimens in our collections are Pa elements. Wherever possible we have tried to identify other elements of apparatuses, particularly for hindeodids, idioprioniodids, and kladognathids (table 1). Genera are listed alphabetically. Many specimens are easily assignable to a genus but are not well enough preserved for specific determination. Most conodonts in the collections have undergone extensive postmortem transport and are thus incomplete and abraded; moreover, some are diagenetically and hydrothermally altered.
All specimens shown on plates 1-5 are reposited in the U.S. National Museum (USNM), Washington, D.C. All other specimens are in the collections of the conodont laboratory of the U.S. Geological Survey, Reston, Va., and are cataloged by USGS collection number. Table 1 and plate 6 show the distribution and abundance of conodont elements, and figure 10 and table 2 show their inferred paleoenvironmental distribution.

Remarks.—Rexroad and Merrill (1985) suggest that A. spathus may be a recurrent ecophenotype of A. lautus. We retain A. spathus, however, as a separate taxon to test this concept; see remarks under A. spathus.
A few sinistral specimens (pi. 1, figs. 13-15) have a short right-trending carinal extension of the blade.
The first appearance of Adetognathus lautus below Declinognathodus noduliferus defines the Upper muricatus Subzone of the latest Chesterian. Adetognathus lautus occurs in two collections from 72 and 65 m below the top of the Alapah Limestone (app. 1, Iocs. lAla, b) but is represented by only one specimen in the Mississippian part of the overlying Wahoo Limestone. This specimen is from a sample taken 53.4 m above the base of the Wahoo Limestone (app. 1, loc. lAlc), about 50 m along strike from USGS colln. 30757-PC in the study section (table 1). Adetognathus lautus does not reappear in our collections from the study section until 84 m above the base of the Wahoo Limestone.
Distribution in the study section.—84 to 260.5 m above the base of the Wahoo Limestone (Morrowan to lower Atokan; lower minutus Fauna to Idiognathodus Fauna).

Remarks.—Specimens of Adetognathus spathus from the Wahoo Limestone may have large, exaggerated antlerlike denticles on the posterior process (pi. 1, figs. 25, 26). Biofacies analysis does not show significant environmental separation in the distribution of A. spathus and A. lautus. This may be a consequence of postmortem hydraulic mixing. The Pa-element morphology suggests a very shallow water, possibly high-energy environment (G.D. Webster, written commun., 1994, and unpub. U.S. Geological Survey collections). We agree with Rexroad and Merrill (1985) who believe that A. spathus may be a recurrent ecophenotype of A. lautus.

71991 Adetognathus sp. cf. Adetognathus n. sp. Tynan. Morrow and Webster, pi. 2, figs. 5, 6.
Description.—Three Pa-element morphotypes occur in the Wahoo Limestone. The two most abundant morphotypes are right sided. The first (pi. 1, figs. 7, 8; = a morphotype of Brown and Rexroad, in Brown and others, 1990) has a free blade with three to four denticles that joins the right parapet (outer) and continues as a fixed blade bearing two

to three denticles; the posteriormost denticle is the largest; therefore, the upper blade profile increases in height posteriorly. The left parapet intercepts the blade two to four denticles behind its anterior margin. In lateral view, the outer margin is slightly to considerably higher than the inner margin. The free blade of the second morphotype (pi. 1, figs. 9, 10; = p morphotype of Brown and Rexroad, in Brown and others, 1990) joins the platform on or slightly left of the right parapet; the very low posteriormost denticle may be slightly to moderately offset to the left; a notch separates the blade from the platform. The upper margin profile of the blade forms a moderate asymmetric arch that is highest in the middle, descends only slightly anteriorly, but steeply posteriorly. In lateral view, the right parapet margin is slightly to considerably higher than the left. The third and rarest Pa morphotype (pi. 1, figs. 11, 12; = y morphotype of Brown and Rexroad, in Brown and others, 1990) has a free blade that joins the platform centrally or subcentrally toward the right. The blade has the same upper margin profile as the p morphotype; the two very low, posteriormost denticles of the blade continue onto the platform as a short carina. In lateral view, right and left parapet margins are approximately equal in height.
Remarks.—Characteristics of the a morphotype do not appear to change ontogenetically; the p morphotype develops a carinal extension of the blade ontogenetically; no juveniles of the y morphotype were found. The collections contain chiefly adult specimens. Specimens of Cavusgnathusl tytthus in the Wahoo Limestone differ slightly from topotype material from the Kinkaid Limestone of the Illinois basin. Carinal extensions of the blade in the p and y morphotypes that are obvious in the material from the Wahoo Limestone were not noted by Brown and Rexroad (in Brown and others, 1990). This is probably because their specimens are small; the name they chose for the species reflects that condition. The trivial name is somewhat unsuitable for the material from the Wahoo Limestone in which most representatives of the species are rather large.
Because no left-bladed specimens appear to occur in Cavusgnathusl tytthus, it seems inappropriate to place the species in Adetognathus, even though its fixed blade is short and, in some morphotypes, may be absent. Presently, it seems best to questionably retain it in Cavusgnathus. The array of morphotypes that occur in C.I tytthus is reminiscent of morphotypes assigned to older Mississippian species of Taphrognathus and Cloghergnathus that are found in shallow-water, somewhat restricted depositional environments.
Brown and Rexroad (in Brown and others, 1990) theorized that Cavusgnathusl tytthus is the phylogenetic link between C. unicornis and C. monocerus (- Adetognathus unicornis (Rexroad and Burton) of Lane, 1967). Cavusgnathusl tytthus occurs with abundant representatives of C. unicornis in the lower part of its range in our section; C. unicornis does not occur above the lower 51 m of the

SYSTEMATIC PALEONTOLOGY

Wahoo Limestone, and C. monocerus is absent at the study section. Thus, our data neither confirm nor contradict Brown and Rexroad's phylogenetic hypothesis.
Distribution in the study section.—22 to 76.5 m above the base of the Wahoo Limestone (uppermost Chesterian to lowermost Morrowan; Upper muricatus Subzone to within noduliferus-primus Zone). Cavusgnathus! tytthus occurs in the upper part of the Alapah Limestone and in many collections from the Wahoo Limestone in the northeast Brooks Range including the type section at Wahoo Lake (app. 1, loc. 4Alc), at Plunge Creek (app. 1, loc. 6), and as far east as the Clarence River at the Canadian border (app. 1, Iocs. lOAlb, c).

Weibel and Norby, pi. 1, fig. 18. Remarks.—Rexroad (1981) synonymized Cavusgnathus regularis (P morphotype) and C. convexus (y morphotype) under C. unicornis (a morphotype). All specimens have a right-sided free blade that is shorter than the fixed blade. In the a morphotype, denticles decrease in size anteriorly; the largest denticle is posteriormost. The blade profile of the P morphotype is uniform in height or may decrease slightly anteriorly. The blade profile of the y morphotype is arched. In collections from the study section, many of the blade denticles are broken so that morphotypes are indeterminate. Of the complete specimens, a and (3 morphotypes are more common than y morphotypes.

Wardlaw (1985, pi. 2, figs. 9-11, 13) included robust, digyrate elements in the apparatus of Cavusgnathus naviculus that he claimed were vicariously shared by most species of Cavusgnathus, including C. unicornis. We strongly disagree with this reconstruction and concur with the element morphotypes determined by Norby (1976) from natural assemblages. The digyrate elements Wardlaw attributed to Cavusgnathus belong instead to Kladognathus (see Merrill and others, 1990). Armstrong and Purnell (1987) also included an Sc element of Kladognathus as well as two morphologically dissimilar M elements in the apparatus of C. unicornis.

Remarks.—Dunn (1970b) expanded the concept of the genus to include forms with a median longitudinal trough and a long, slightly declined, medial carina (= Declinognathodus lateralis (Higgins and Bouckaert)). Grayson and others (1990) concurred with Dunn's emendation but considered D. lateralis morphotypes as vertically persistent species of Declinognathodus that are convergent with Neognathodus.

36 CONODONT BIOSTRATIGRAPHY AND BIOFACIES OF THE WAHOO LIMESTONE

Declinognathodus noduliferus (Ellison and Graves, 1941)
Gray son and others (1990) provide an extensive synonymy for the species.
Remarks.—Declinognathodids in our collections are assigned to Declinognathodus noduliferus noduliferus, D. n. japonicus, or D. n. subspp. indeterminate. A few specimens in a single collection (USGS colln. 30786-PC; pi. 3, fig. 32), 187 m above the base of the Wahoo Limestone, resemble forms assigned to D. lateralis (Higgins and Bouckaert) by other workers. These specimens are the largest declinognathodids in a sample that also contains the most abundant and largest rhachistognathids in our collections. We suspect that these D. lateralis morphotypes are ecophenotypic and (or) gerontic specimens. Consequently, they are included in D. noduliferus.
Specimens identified as Declinognathodus noduliferus japonicus, however, exhibit variation in ornamentation, deflection of the carina, and spacing of posterior nodes within each sample throughout the Wahoo Limestone. Some specimens have transverse ridges on the anterior inner margin (pi. 3, figs. 6, 7). All specimens of D. n. japonicus have one or two accessory nodes that are in contact with or cleanly separated from the carina near the anterior platform margin. Juvenile specimens tend to have more widely spaced posterior nodes and a straighter carina. Specimens with very nodose ornamentation (pi. 3, fig. 22) are rare and considered ecophenotypes; Gray son (1984, p. 50) erected a separate species (Idiognathoides marginodosus', = Declinognathodus marginodosus of Grayson, 1990) for such forms. We see no stratigraphic succession of D. noduliferus morphotypes in our section and, therefore, retain these forms in D. n. japonicus.

1992 Declinognathodus marginodosus (Grayson). Sutherland and Grayson, pi. 2, fig. 11.
Remarks.—Most specimens are identical to the types of Declinognathodus noduliferus japonicus. Several specimens (pi. 3, fig. 22), however, have an undeflected carina, relatively even-noded margin and carina, and a single, prominent, round node that is cleanly separated from the carina near the anterior margin of the outer lobe. Such forms were included in D. marginodosus by Grayson (1990) and Sutherland and Grayson (1992). We include these in D. n. japonicus because some populations are intergradational between D. n. japonicus and D. marginodosus (Grayson). We regard D. marginodosus to be a possible shallower water ecophenotype of D. n. japonicus. Partial division of the anteriormost node produces an incipient third node in a few specimens (pi. 3, fig. 9).
Distribution in the study section.—56 to 250 m above the base of the Wahoo Limestone (lowest Morrowan to lower Atokan; noduliferus-primus Zone to Idiognathodus Fauna).
Known stratigraphic range.—lowest Morrowan (base of noduliferus-primus Zone) to at least lower Desmoinesian(?).

Remarks.—Almost all specimens from the Wahoo Limestone assigned to Declinognathodus noduliferus noduliferus have nodose and (or) transversely ridged parapets, an outwardly deflected carina, and three or more accessory nodes on the anterior outer margin (pi. 3, fig. 12). The carina merges with the outer parapet within or slightly posterior to the anterior half of the platform (pi. 3, figs. 11, 12). According to Higgins (1975, 1985), specimens of D. noduliferus in which the carina merges with the outer parapet within the posterior half of the platform should be referred to D. n. inaequalis. None of our specimens are comparable to the holotype of D. n. inaequalis, which has a carina that extends well beyond the anterior half of the platform.

Genus DIPLOGNATHODUS Kozur and Merrill, 1975
Type species.—Spathognathodus coloradoensis Murray and Chronic, 1965
p. 606, 607, pi. 72, figs. 11-13
Remarks.—von Bitter and Merrill (1990) recommend that only forms having a spatulate carina be included within the genus. They admit that species presently assigned to the genus are morphologically variable and probably polyphyletic. A single specimen is tentatively assigned to Diplognathodusl ellesmerensis, a species questionably included in Diplognathodus because its Pa element has a denticulate carina.

1992 Diplognathodus sp. A. Sutherland and Grayson, pi- 2, fig. 9.
71993 Diplognathodus? orphanus Merrill. Lemos, pi. 4, fig. 6.
Description.—One poorly preserved juvenile(?) Pa element has a free blade bearing eight partly fused denticles. The upper margin profile of the blade gradually increases in height from the anterior margin to midlength and then descends abruptly at the intersection of the blade and platform. A carina of eight mostly fused but distinct denticles gradually decreases in height toward the posterior tip of the platform. The platform margin is incomplete; the lobes appear to be unornamented, oval, and possibly symmetrical. The basal cavity is gnathodontid.
Remarks.—The single specimen resembles Diplognathodusl ellesmerensis but has a few more denticles on the carina than specimens illustrated by Bender (1980). Moreover, the upper margin profile of the posterior end of the carina decreases abruptly in height and is adenticulate in most of Bender's specimens.
We agree with Bender (1980) and von Bitter and Merrill (1990) that this species is closer to Diplognathodusl orphanus (Merrill) than to other diplognathodids.
Distribution in the study section.—203 m above the base of the Wahoo Limestone (upper Morrowan or lower Atokan; Idiognathodus Fauna).

SYSTEMATIC PALEONTOLOGY

Known stratigraphic range.—Diplognathodus? ellesmerensis is known from the Canadian Arctic islands, Yukon, southeast Alaska, Oklahoma, Michigan, and Spain and apparently ranges from upper Morrowan to Desmoinesian (von Bitter and Merrill, 1990, fig. 4). Sutherland and Manger (1984a) recommended that the first appearance of Diplognathodus or the foraminifer Eoschubertella be used as a guide to the base of the Atokan. This recommendation preceded the recognition of diplognathodids in the Morrowan (von Bitter and Merrill, 1990). Diplognathodusl orphanus appears to be the only known species restricted to the Atokan.
Material.— 1 Pa element.
Genus GNATHODUS Pander, 1856
Type species.—Polygnathus bilineatus Roundy, 1926 p. 13, pi. 3, figs. lOa-c
Remarks.—Gnathodus bilineatus (Roundy) was designated the type species of Gnathodus by Tubbs (1986) because the types of G. mosquensis, the oldest described species of the genus, were lost and its type locality was uncertain.

Gnathodus bilineatus bilineatus and (or) G. b. bollandensis have been reported from lowermost upper Carboniferous strata (in samples containing Declinognathodus noduliferus or other late Carboniferous species) in many parts of the world (for example, Malaysia, Metcalfe, 1980; South China, Wang and Higgins, 1989; Texas, Grayson and others, 1990; Ukraine, Nemirovskaya and others, 1991; south Tienshan, Uzbekistan, Nigmadganov and Nemirovskaya, 1992a). We regard the specimen of G. b. bilineatus (pi. 5, fig. 23) that occurs 13m above the lowest D. n. japonicus in the Wahoo Limestone to be redeposited.
Material.—8 Pa elements.
Gnathodus bilineatus subsp. indet.
Remarks.—A few small specimens can be identified only as G. bilineatus.
Distribution in the study section.—37 to 53 m above the base of the Wahoo Limestone (uppermost Chesterian; Upper muricatus Subzone).
Known stratigraphic range.—upper Meramecian into lowermost Morrowan.
Material.—3 Pa elements.

1992 Gnathodus defectus Dunn. Morrow and Webster, pi. 1, fig. 2.
1993 Gnathodus defectus Dunn. Dumoulin and Harris, fig. 8£.
Remarks.—Most specimens assigned to this species are considerably smaller than those illustrated from Nevada by Dunn (1966). Most, however, are like the specimen illustrated by Dunn (1970b) on plate 62, figure 16 and text-figure 9C.
Distribution in the study section.—54.9? to 157 m above the base of the Wahoo Limestone.
Known stratigraphic range.—From within the Chesterian (from at least below the muricatus Zone) to at least the lower Morrowan (lower minutus Fauna). Dunn (1966) indicated that Gnathodus defectus extended into the lowest Morrowan because it occurred in samples with Rhachistognathus primus. Wardlaw (1984) and Morrow and Webster (1992) considered G. defectus in Pennsylvanian samples indigenous; however, it is possible that the sporadic occurrence of G. defectus from 30 to 102 m above the Mississippian-Pennsylvanian boundary in the study section indicates redeposition. Some redeposited Mississippian conodonts occur in the Pennsylvanian part of the section (table 1). Gnathodus defectus occurs in four samples from the lower member of the Wahoo Limestone between 157.5 and 100.5 m below the Wahoo Limestone and Echooka Formation contact at Pogopuk Creek (samples collected by S.K. Morgan, University of Alaska Fairbanks). The conodont species association in the lowest collection indicates the noduliferus-primus Zone, and the remaining collections are indicative of the lower minutus Fauna (app. 1, loc. 5d). The data from Pogopuk Creek and the study section indicate that G. defectus extends well into the Morrowan (into the lower minutus Fauna) in the northeast Brooks Range.
Material.—9 Pa elements.

1992 Gnathodus girtyi girtyi Hass. Morrow and Webster, pi. 1, fig. 3.
Remarks.—Gnathodus girtyi girtyi has a welldeveloped transversely ridged anterior inner parapet that continues to or close to the posterior end of the platform where it is noded and merges with the carina. The anterior part of the inner parapet is as high as or higher than the carina. The outer parapet begins posterior to and terminates slightly to considerably anterior of the inner parapet and is lower than the carina. The carina is central, straight or slightly deflected, and continues to the posterior tip of the platform where it expands to form split nodes or transverse ridges in adult or gerontic specimens (pi. 2, fig. 20).
We are unable to evaluate the taxonomic position of the specimens assigned to Gnathodus sp. cf. G. girtyi subspp. by Grayson and others (1985a) as well as many specimens assigned to G. girtyi by other workers without examining the actual specimens and the conodont faunule in which they occur.
Distribution in the study section.—0.4 to 54.9 m above the base of the Wahoo Limestone (uppermost Chesterian; Upper muricatus Subzone) and 69 to 74 m (lower Morrowan—redeposited?).
Known stratigraphic range.—upper Meramecian to uppermost Chesterian (Upper muricatus Subzone).
Material.—56 Pa elements.

1993 Gnathodus girtyi simplex Dunn. Dumoulin and Harris, fig. 8C.
Remarks.—Gnathodus girtyi simplex differs from G. g. girtyi by having an outer parapet consisting of one or two nodes that are restricted to the anterior half of the platform.
Specimens from the Wahoo Limestone below the Mississippian-Pennsylvanian boundary are transitional to Declinognathodus noduliferus japonicus (pi. 2, fig. 30) confirming Dunn's (1970b) concept of the phylogeny of D. noduliferus.
Distribution in the study section.—6 to 54.9 m above the base of the Wahoo Limestone (uppermost Chesterian; Upper muricatus Subzone).
Known stratigraphic range.—Chesterian into nodulifems-primus Zone. Lane and others (1985a) and Baesemann and Lane (1985) reported Gnathodus girtyi simplex from about the basal 5 m of the Pennsylvanian in their Arrow Canyon section, Nevada. In the northeast Brooks Range, G. g. simplex occurs in two sections with or above Declinognathodus noduliferus, 1 km west of the study section (app. 1, Iocs. IBle, g) and at Pogopuk Creek, about 220 m below the base of the Echooka Formation (app. 1, loc. 5b).
Material.—72 Pa elements.
Gnathodus girtyi subspp. indet.
Remarks.—Included are chiefly broken, abraded, or juvenile Pa elements.
Distribution in the study section.—0.4 m above the base of the Wahoo Limestone (uppermost Chesterian; Upper muricatus Subzone).
Known stratigraphic range.—upper Meramecian into lowermost Morrowan (into noduliferus-primus Zone).
Material.—54 Pa elements.

Plate 2, figures 29, 30
1985a Gnathodus girtyi simplex transitional to Declinognathodus noduliferus. Lane and others, fig. 1C.
Remarks.—An array of gnathodontid Pa element morphotypes that range from Gnathodus girtyi subspp. to Declinognathodus spp. appear close to the MississippianPennsylvanian boundary. These morphologic variations make taxonomic assignment uncertain. Pa elements transitional between G. g. simplex and D. n. japonicus (pi. 2, fig. 30) in the highest Mississippian samples (53 and 54.9 m above the base of the Wahoo Limestone and 2 and 0.1 m below the base of the Pennsylvanian) support the suggestion of Dunn (1970b) and Lane and Manger (1985) that G. g. simplex is the ancestor to D. noduliferus. These specimens are closer to G. g. simplex because the trough separating the inner parapet from the carina does not extend to the posterior tip of the platform, and the node(s) forming the outer parapet are not cleanly separated from the carina. These specimens do show, however, a slight depression between the inner parapet and carina near the posterior tip of the platform. A few specimens from 13 m above the Mississippian-Pennsylvanian boundary are transitional between G. g. girtyi and D. inaequalis (Higgins) (pi. 2, fig. 29).
Distribution in the study section.—53 to 69 m above the base of the Wahoo Limestone (uppermost Chesterian to lowermost Morrowan; Upper muricatus Subzone into noduliferus-primus Zone).
Material.—9 Pa elements.

Remarks.—All specimens of the apparatus of Hindeodus minutus in the collections from the Wahoo Limestone conform to the multielement reconstruction shown in Mapes and Rexroad (1986) and Brown and others (1991).
A Pa element figured by Rexroad and Horowitz (1990, pi. 1, fig. 42) as Hindeodus cristula (Youngquist and Miller) has the same anterior denticulation as H. minutus.

44 CONODONT BIOSTRATIGRAPHY AND BIOFACIES OF THE WAHOO LIMESTONE

Remarks.—Grayson and others (1989) revised the diagnosis for Idiognathodus sinuosus, I. klapperi, and /. incurvus on the basis of the position of the adcarinal ridges and used this characteristic to establish a phylogeny. Idiognathodus sinuosus (originating in the middle Morrowan) has two adcarinal ridges, the inner of which extends slightly anterior of the platform and parallel to the free blade; /. klapperi (late Morrowan) has ridges that are restricted to the platform; and /. incurvus (Atokan) has ridges that extend anteriorly beyond the platform and intersect the free blade. The poor preservation and apparent low diversity of idiognathodids in the Wahoo Limestone do not allow us to test the evolutionary model proposed for the genus by Grayson and others (1989). Some specimens that Grayson and others (1990) and Sutherland and Grayson (1992, for example, pi. 2, fig. 21) include in /. klapperi appear to be representatives of the /. sinuosus complex (/. delicatus morphotype). We did not recognize any specimens that we could confidently assign to /. klapperi.
Two specimens, 16 and 12 m below the top of the Wahoo Limestone, are questionably assigned to Idiognathodus incurvus. One is a juvenile and the other is a large adult. Although the latter is abraded, the adcarinal ridges extend beyond the anterior platform margin to intersect the remnant of the free blade (pi. 5, fig. 21).
Distribution in the study section.—246 to 250 m above the base of the Wahoo Limestone (lower Atokan; Idiognathodus Fauna). Idiognathodus incurvus! is used to indicate a level no older than Atokan at the study section on the basis of its distribution in the Atoka Formation in Oklahoma.
Known stratigraphic range.—From within the Atokan (probably lower Atokan) to lower Desmoinesian.
Material.—2 Pa elements.

son, pi. 4, figs. 36-39. 1992 Idiognathodus sinuosus Ellison and Graves. Suther-
land and Grayson, pi. 2, figs. 28, 29. Remarks.—See remarks under Idiognathodus incurvus! for Grayson and others' (1989) concept of/, sinuosus. In addition, Grayson and others (1990) synonymize /. delicatus Gunnell and /. sinuosus', we follow their concept here. Many subadult and adult specimens included in Idiognathodus sinuosus have nodes on only one side of the platform but, uncharacteristic of/, sinuosus, have a relatively straight platform. One subadult specimen (pi. 3, fig. 23) has rostral ridges of equal length that extend slightly beyond the anterior end of the platform. This specimen is included in /. sinuosus and not in /. incurvus because similar size speci-

mens of the latter exhibit rostral ridges characteristic of that species. Grayson (1990, pi. 4, figs. 37-39) includes similar forms in /. sinuosus.
Distribution in the study section.— 187 to 243 m above the base of the Wahoo Limestone (upper Morrowan and (or) lower Atokan; Idiognathodus Fauna).

Remarks.—Grayson (1984) indicated that the length of the trough of the dextral Pa element of Idiognathoides ouachitensis was diagnostic of this late Morrowan species. Moreover, he inferred a phylogenetic succession, on the basis of increasing trough length, from /. corrugatus to /. ouachitensis. Subsequently, Grayson (1990) and Grayson and others (1990) synonymized these species with the longranging /. sinuatus and speculated that the character of the trough was environmentally controlled. Wang and others (1987) synonymized /. ouachitensis in /. corrugatus but continued to recognize /. sinuatus as a separate species. We follow the multielement concept implemented by Grayson and others (1990) by including all three within /. sinuatus. Only three specimens of the genus were recovered from the study section. All are from one sample and appear to have troughs characteristic of the "/. ouachitensis" mor-

photype. Because of their rarity, we cannot evaluate the environmental preference of these forms. Likewise, we cannot evaluate their biostratigraphic utility.
Distribution in the study section.—217.5 m above the base of the Wahoo Limestone (upper Morrowan or lower Atokan; Idiognathodus Fauna).
Known stratigraphic distribution.—lower Morrowan (sinuatus-minutus Zone) through at least Atokan.

Elements approximate the better preserved material illustrated by Savage and Barkeley (1985, fig. 5). We have referred virtually all representatives of Idioprioniodus in the collections from the Wahoo Limestone to /. conjunctus?. Distribution in the study section.—53 to 257.5 rn above the base of the Wahoo Limestone (uppermost Chesterian to lower Atokan; Upper muricatus Subzone to Idiognathodus Fauna). Known stratigraphic range.—Within the Upper Mississippian to at least Desmoinesian. Material.—6 Pb, 7 M, 5 Sa, 10 Sb, and 7 Sc elements.

Idioprioniodus cf. /. healdi (Roundy, 1926)?
Plate 5, figure 13
For synonymy to 1987, see Stone (1991). Remarks.—Stone (1991) assigned many Mississippian
representatives of Idioprioniodus to /. cf. I. healdi, including /. paraclaviger (Rexroad). One Pb? element from the Wahoo Limestone conforms to the Sbj element illustrated by Stone for /. cf. /. healdi (1991, pi. 5, fig. 5). This element, unlike similar elements of /. conjunctus, has a denticle immediately anterior to the cusp that is fused to it, at least near its base. Pb or Sb elements of forms we assign to /. conjunctus? do not have an anterior denticle fused to or impinging on the cusp.
Distribution in the study section.—207 m above the base of the Wahoo Limestone (Morrowan or lower Atokan; Idiognathodus Fauna).
Known stratigraphic range.—upper Osagean to at least Chesterian. The specimen from the Wahoo Limestone is from Pennsylvanian strata.
Material.— 1 Pb? element.
Idioprioniodus spp. indet.
Plate 5, figure 12
Remarks.-—Broken and abraded robust digyrate elements, some of which are indeterminate to morphotype.
Distribution in the study section.—0.4 to 241 m above the base of the Wahoo Limestone (uppermost Chesterian to lower Atokan?; Upper muricatus Subzone to Idiognathodus Fauna).
Known stratigraphic range.—Lower Mississippian (upper Osagean) to at least Desmoinesian.
Material.—I Pa, 3 Pb, 8 M, 6 Sa, and 7 Sb elements and 9 elements indeterminate to morphotype.
Genus KLADOGNATHUS Rexroad, 1958
Type species.—Cladognathus prima Rexroad, 1957 p. 28, 29, pi. 1, figs. 8-10 Kladognathus spp.
Plate 5, figures 1-10
For synonymies of several species of Kladognathus, see Rexroad (1981) and Rexroad and Horowitz (1990).
Remarks.—Element notation for Kladognathus spp. follows that of Purnell (1993). Purnell's reconstruction is based on a well-preserved bedding-plane assemblage in the gut of a conodont predator. Except for some M elements, all kladognathid specimens from the Wahoo Limestone are incomplete. Thus, we could not distinguish Pa from Pb elements, and we have not attempted to identify the four morphotypes of the Sb-Sc transition series documented by Purnell (1993). The end members of the Sb-Sc transition series are illustrated (pi. 5, figs. 9, 10).

46 CONODONT BIOSTRATIGRAPHY AND BIOFACIES OF THE WAHOO LIMESTONE

The lowest collection from the Wahoo Limestone contains the greatest number of kladognathids (table 1, USGS colln. 30745-PC). Most elements appear to be Kladognathus tenuis (Branson and Mehl) as reconstructed by Rexroad and Horowitz (1990).

Remarks.—Baesemann and Lane (1985) recognized three subspecies of Rhachistognathus minutus—R. m. declinatus, R. m. havlenai, and R. m. minutus—on the basis of the position of the blade attachment and the degree of

curvature of the anterior part of the left platform margin. They reported (p. 107) that "All specimens in our collections are comparatively small." In contrast, adult to gerontic specimens from the Wahoo Limestone are quite large (some incomplete specimens are at least 1 mm long; pi. 4, figs. 58). Many specimens exhibit transitional subspecies characteristics so that subspecific assignment of such forms was arbitrary. In addition, some specimens of R. tn. minutus are similar to R. muricatus (pi. 4, fig. 15; Higgins, 1985, pi. 6.2, fig. 9). Regularly nodose specimens were cosmopolitan (R. m. minutus) and probably lived in relatively uniform, normal-marine shallow-water environments, whereas increasingly asymmetrical forms (R. muricatus to R. primus} occupied more variable shallow-water environments and were chiefly North American Cordilleran and southern Midcontinent inhabitants.
We are unable to evaluate the biostratigraphic utility, if any, of the subspecies of R. minutus from the Wahoo Limestone. All subspecies appear between 84 and 85 m above the base of the section and continue to near the top. We suppose that any paleoecologic partitioning of these subspecies was obliterated by hydraulic mixing across the Wahoo carbonate platform. The distribution of R. minutus subspp. in the Arrow Canyon section, Nevada (Baesemann and Lane, 1985), is quite different from that of our section. At Arrow Canyon, R. m. minutus and R. m. havlenai make their appearance about 105 m below that of R. m. declinatus, co-occur for about 90 m, and disappear about 15 m below the first R. m. declinatus. R. m. declinatus continues as the only rhachistognathid in the succeeding 75 m. Unfortunately, Baesemann and Lane (1985) do not explain the stratigraphic succession of these subspecies nor the paleoenvironmental implications. Varker and others (1991) report all three subspecies together in several samples.

and Lane. Varker and others, pi. 1, figs. 30, 31. Remarks.—Rhachistognathus minutus declinatus is the most abundant rhachistognathid in the Wahoo Limestone. One sample from the upper member yielded 276 Pa elements of R. m. declinatus; some specimens are transi-

tional to R. m. havlenai (table 1, USGS colln. 30786-PC). The free blade joins the platform subcentrally and, with few exceptions, the anterior end of the left parapet is deflected to the left. A few gerontic specimens have the anterior end of the right parapet deflected to the right (pi. 4, fig. 6). The inner platform margin of some gerontic Pa elements have one or two nodes (pi. 4, figs. 7, 8); a transverse ridge may extend from the node(s) to the parapet (pi. 4, fig. 7).
A form geometrically similar to R. m. declinatus was described from Lower and Middle Pennsylvanian rocks in southeast Alaska by Savage and Barkeley (1985). The platform margin of their species, "Taphrognathus alaskensis" however, is ornamented by closely spaced, delicate transverse ridges, whereas R. m. declinatus has noded or transversely ridged and noded parapets. The new species may represent a part of the R. minutus plexus that occupied quiet, open-marine environments.
Distribution in the study section.—85 to 261.5 m above the base of the Wahoo Limestone (lower Morrowan to lower Atokan; lower minutus Fauna to Idiognathodus Fauna).
Known stratigraphic range.—lower Morrowan (base of sinuatus-minutus Zone in North America, but below the mid-Carboniferous boundary and within the lowermost Chokierian in England; Varker and others, 1991) to lower Atokan.
Material.—518 Pa elements.

and Lane. Varker and others, pi. 1, figs. 26-29. Remarks.—According to Baesemann and Lane (1985), the offset of the free blade from the left parapet distinguishes Rhachistognathus minutus havlenai from R. m. minutus and R. muricatus. The anterior margin of the left parapet in R. m. havlenai is straight as opposed to R. m. declinatus in which it curves strongly outward (compare pi. 4, figs. 1, 10). Distribution in the study section.—85 to 261.5 m above the base of the Wahoo Limestone (lower Morrowan to lower Atokan; lower minutus Fauna to Idiognathodus Fauna).

Remarks.—This species is the most morphologically variable rhachistognathid and is intermediate between Rhachistognathus minutus and R. primus. Many specimens in the collections from the Wahoo Limestone conform to the species diagnosis, whereas others are transitional to R. minutus, R. primus, or R. websteri. Transition forms are discussed below. Distribution in the study section.—6 to 133.5 m above the base of the Wahoo Limestone (uppermost Chesterian to Morrowan; Upper muricatus Subzone to lower minutus Fauna).

Remarks.-—The absence of a narrow, medial trough distinguishes R. primus from R. muricatus. Specimens considered transitional between R. muricatus and R. primus have a moderate trough on the anterior half of the platform and a shallow trough containing a row of low nodes on the posterior half.
Distribution in the study section.—85 to 95 m above the base of the Wahoo Limestone (Morrowan; lower minutus Fauna).
Material.—4 Pa elements.
Rhachistognathus muricatus (Dunn) transitional to R. websteri Baesemann and Lane
Plate 4, figure 16
Remarks.—Rhachistognathus websteri is distinguished from other rhachistognathids by a prominent marginal node that is distinctly offset from the posterior part of the outer parapet. This node is only slightly offset in the figured specimen.
Distribution in the study section.—6 m above the base of the Wahoo Limestone (uppermost Chesterian; Upper muricatus Subzone).
Material.— 1 Pa element.
Rhachistognathus prolixus Baesemann and Lane, 1985?
Remarks.—Two posterior platform fragments resemble Rhachistognathus prolixus but are too incomplete for positive identification.
Distribution in the study section.—6 to 157 m above the base of the Wahoo Limestone (uppermost Chesterian to Morrowan; Upper muricatus Subzone to lower minutus Fauna).
Known stratigraphic range.—lower Chesterian to middle Morrowan.
Material.—3 Pa element fragments.

Remarks.—The morphology of Pa elements agrees with those synonymized above; most specimens are relatively small. Rhachistognathus websteri may be an ecophenotype of R. muricatus. Collections containing abundant R. muricatus generally contain relatively abundant R. websteri and visa versa (compare table 1, USGS collns. 30770-PC and 30773-PC). The same relationships persist in the northeast Brooks Range (app. 1, loc. 5d).
Distribution in the study section.—59 to 162 m above the base of the Wahoo Limestone (lowermost Morrowan; noduliferus-primus Zone to lower minutus Fauna).

Remarks.—Purnell and von Bitter (1992, their table 1) summarize the characteristics of species of Vogelgnathus spp. Specimens of V postcampbelli from the Wahoo Limestone are poorly preserved Pa elements having 10 to 14 denticles. The upper margin profile of most specimens gradually increases in height posteriorly toward the cusp and then sharply decreases from the cusp to the posterior tip (pi. 3, figs. 28, 30). Some specimens have a cusp that is slightly higher and wider than adjacent denticles.
Vogelgnathus postcampbelli is locally common to abundant in beds above and below the MississippianPennsylvanian boundary in the northeast Brooks Range (for example, app. 1, loc. 7a, 50 km southwest of the study section in the Fourth Range, 20 m below the MississippianPennsylvanian boundary; app. 1, loc. IBlg, 1 km west of the study section—53 Pa elements from 2.8 m above the boundary, pi. 3, fig. 31). All specimens are nearly identical to and some are even more poorly preserved than those from the study section.
Distribution in the study section.—0.4 to 76.5 m above the base of the Wahoo Limestone (uppermost Chesterian to lower Morrowan; Upper muricatus Subzone to noduliferusprinius Zone).
Known stratigraphic range.—At least Chesterian into the lowermost Morrowan (no younger than noduliferusprimus Zone).
Material.— 16 Pa elements.

3-3.5 Two collections from the lower 8 m of the section contain many Mississippian and Mississippian to Pennsylvanian conodonts. In other sections in the northeast Brooks Range, R. minutus first appears considerably above Declinognathodus noduliferus so that R. minutus is considered indigenous and the Mississippian elements of the faunule redeposited. However, in England, R. minutus appears before D. noduliferus (Varker and others, 1991) and in the Ukraine it appears at the
3-3.5 same time as D. nodu//ferus(Nemirovskaya and others, 1991). This faunule may represent the oldest occurrence of R. minutus in the northeast Brooks Range.
