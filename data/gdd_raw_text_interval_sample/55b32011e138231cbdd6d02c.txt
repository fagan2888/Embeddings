GROUND WATER IN THE LOWER GREAT MIAMI RIVER VALLEY, OHIO

GROUND-WATER HYDROLOGY AND GEOLOGY OF THE LOWER GREAT MIAMI RIVER VALLEY, OHIO

By ANDREW M. SPIEKER

ABSTRACT
The valley of the lower Great Miami River, extending from Dayton to the Ohio River about 15 miles west of Cincinnati, is one of the most productive sources of ground water in the Midwestern United States. A major buried valley averaging 2 miles in width and 150-200 feet in depth, formed during interglacial intervals of the Pleistocene Epoch and subsequently filled with highly permeable sand and gravel outwash, follows essentially the course of the present Great Miami River.
The valley can be divided into 11 hydrogeologic environments on the basis of the nature and thickness of the aquifer materials, the availability of recharge by induced stream infiltration, and the presence or absence of semiconfining clay layers. The most favorable areas for the development of large ground-water supplies are in those environments where 150 feet or more of sand and gravel with no clay layers are close enough to a major stream to permit recharge by induced infiltration. These most favorable areas are near Trenton, the reach of the Great Miami River between Hamilton and Ross, and the lower Whitewater River valley south of Harrison, where individual wells can yield as much as 3,000 gpm. Only slightly less favorable are the areas similarly situated near streams but where the aquifer is less than 150 feet thick, or where the aquifer contains areally extensive layers of clay. Most of the valley north of Middletown is in the last category.
Pumping from an aquifer hydraulically connected with a stream will generally reduce the streamflow between the point of withdrawal and the point of sewage return. Little net depletion of streamflow is evident in the report area, however, for the sewage returns are generally close to the points of withdrawal. The returned used water is thus available again for induced recharge to the aquifers. Such recycling of water would theoretically make possible pumping of ground water in the area at a virtually unlimited rate. The limit of such pumping from wells Whose water supplies are recharg-ed with used water would be imposed by deterioration of the water quality or by the cost of adequate treatment of the used water.
In the parts of the valley where the aquifer is either too far from a major stream for induced infiltration or overlain by a semiconfining clay layer, individual wells can be expected to yield 500 gallons per minute, although yields as high as 1,000 gallons per minute are not uncommon. Such environments are present in abandoned segments of the ancestral Great Miami River valley between West Carrollton and Carlisle, between Trenton and New Miami, and between Ross and Harrison. Smaller areas with this environment are present southeast of Hamilton and southeast of Middletown. The least favorable

hydrogeologic environments are in tributary buried valleys

filled largely or entirely With clay and in the upland areas where

shale bedrock is overlain by relatively impermeable glacial till.

Large ground-water supplies generally cannot be developed in

these last two environments.

The discharge of Great Miami River at Hamilton equals or

exceeds 490 cubic feet per second 90 percent of the time. The base

flow of this stream is among the highest in Ohio, and ample

water is available for recharge;to the aquifer by induced steam

infiltration. The recharge rate by induced infiltration in warm

weather under conditions of low streamflow has been determined

to be about 400,000 gallons per day per acre of streambed, with

considerably higher rates under conditions of higher streamflow.

Pumpage of ground water, which is mostly concentrated

around the area's larger cities, totaled 110 million gallons per day

in 1964. The ground-water resources of much of the area remain

untapped. The gradient of the water surface trends generally

toward the southwest at 5-10 feet per mile, about the same as

the gradient of the Great Miami River. Small cones of depression

have formed around the pumping centers at Miamisburg, Chau-

tauqua, Franklin, Middletown, New Miami, Hamilton, Fairfield,

Ross, and Cleves. The only major cone of depression, about 70

feet deep, is around the Armco East Works in southeast

Middletown.

The ground-water surface in most of the valley" stands about

30-50 feet beneath the land surface; it fluctuates about 5-15 feet

annually, generally rising during the winter and spring and

falling during the summer and autumn. The fluctuation is great-

est in the areas where ground water is being pumped or where

the aquifer is semiconflned. The only area of chronic overdraft

of the aquifer, indicated by a persistent decline of the water

level, is the vicinity of the Armco East Works, where the water

level was 132 feet below land surface at the end of 1964.

Water in the lower Great Miami River valley is generally hard,

containing high concentrations of calcium and bicarbonates.

The total dissolved solids content of both ground water and sur-

face water is typically 400-450 milligrams per liter. The Great

Miami River is generally contaminated by organic and industrial

wastes in most of the area of investigation. Concentrations of the

contaminants are highest during prolonged periods of low

streamflow. Water from some wells where the aquifer is being

recharged by induced infiltration from the Great Miami River

has become slightly contaminated, as indicated by the presence

of minute quantities of phenols and higher than normal concen-

trations of nitrate. Such contamination of ground water has not

yet become a serious problem.

INTRODUCTION

Investigation of the occurrence of ground water in and achieve the most efficient and beneficial use of the

the lower Great Miami River valley was made during 1961-65; the present series of reports on the area's ground-water resources is a result of that investigation. Water is the key to the industrial prominence of the

resource. Emphasis is placed on the relation between the ground-water resource and the physical environment in which it occurs. This interrelation is termed the "hydrogeologic environment" in tnis report. The availability

more than 150 years ago owing to its ease of access by way of the Great Miami River, and later by way of the Miami and Erie Canal. The earliest industries the paper mills settled along the river. More recently the

sources of recharge to the principal aquifers, and the maintenance of adequate water quality in the streams that are sources of recharge are considered to be the key factors in this interrelation.

availability of ground water has been an important fac-

tor in the area's industrial growth.
All the cities in the Great Miami River valley depend entirely on ground water for their public supplies, and many of the larger industries have their own wells. Ground water is so much more abundant in this area than it is in the Cincinnati metropolitan area immediately adjacent that on three separate occasions industrial and municipal interests in Cincinnati have sought relief from water shortages by using ground water in the Great Miami River valley to supplement their own supplies.
Purpose of the investigation was to make available the facts needed to solve or control four significant water problems that exist in the report area; they are as follows:
1. Variable .availability of water in place and time Identification of the distribution in place of the major aquifers and their relation to sources of recharge. Consideration of changes in ground-water storage with respect to time.
2. Local overdraft and declining ground-water levels resulting from increased water use. Identification of areas of present and potential overdraft based on analysis of water-level trends. Predicted effect of future ground-water development on water levels.
3. Ground-water contamination. Identification of present contamination, possible sources of con-

The lower Great Miami River valley has been the subject of several water-resources and geologic investigations. Fuller and Clapp (1912) conducted the first reconnaissance of the area's ground-water resources. Klaer and Thompson (1948) described the occurrence of ground water in Butler and Hamilton Counties, which include most .of the present study area. Norris, Cross, and Goldthwait (1948) described the geology and water resources of Montgomery County, which includes the northernmost part of the present area. Walker (1960av b, c) prepared generalized water-availability maps of the area. These maps are part of the Ohio Division of Water series of such maps of the entire State, which show the occurrence of ground water by drainage basins. Spieker (1961) summarized the occurrence of ground water in the lower Great Miami River valley and the, adjacent areas of Dayton and the Mill Creek valley. Klaer and Kazmann (1943) and Dove (1961) presented detailed quantitative appraisals of ground water in the Fairfield and Venice (Ross in the present report) areas, respectively. Bemhagen and Schaefer. (1947) provided up-to-date information for Butler and Hamilton Counties. Fenneman (1916) described the geology of the southern part of the area. Caster, Dalve, and Pope. (1955) summarized the paleontology and stratigraphy. Goldthwait, White, and Forsyth (1961) mapped the Pleistocene deposits of the area.

WELL-NUMBERING SYSTEM

All wells included in the present report except obser-

vation wells maintained by the Ohio Division of Water

are numbered sequentially, from the northeastern part

of the study area to the southwestern part, beginning

with 1 and ending with 104. The Ohio Division of

Water observation wells are identified by their assigned

numbers, which consist of a prefix denoting the county

followed by a number. All such observation wells used

in the present report are'described in Bulletin 41 of the

Ohio Division of Water (Kaser and Harstine, 1965).

Prefixes for well designations are "Bu" for Butler

Comity, "H" for Hamilton County, and "Mt" for Mont-

gomery County. The location of all wells is shown on

plates 1 and 2. Table 10 (p. A34) is a summary of records

of the wells pertinent to this report.

.

The present report is not intended to be a comprehen-

sive inventory of wells in the lower Great Miami River

valley. Only those .wells specifically discussed in the re-

port are included in table 10. Records of several hundred

wells collected during the investigation are on file with

the Columbus, Ohio, district of the U.S. Geological Sur-

vey. Thousands of additional well records are on file

with the Ohio Division of Water in Columbus, for

drillers in Ohio have been required by law to file logs of

all wells drilled since 1948.

LOCATION, TOPOGRAPHY, AND DRAINAGE i
The report area consists of the lower part bf the

Great Miami River valley; it extends from West Car-

rollton to the Ohio River near the southwest corner of

Ohio.(fig. 1). This area is in the Till Plains section of

the Central Lowland physiographic province (Fenne-

man, 1938, p. 499-518). The south edge of the area is at

the north margin of the Bluegrass section of the Interior

Low Plateau (Fenneman, 1938, p. 427-431), and its

topography resembles the unglaciated Bluegrass region

more than it does the glaciated Till Plains. Character-

istic topography in the study area consists of flat to

rolling uplands at altitudes ranging generally from 850

to 1,000 feet. South of the boundary of the Wisconsin

Glaciation, which extended to just south of Fairfield,

the terrain is considerably more rugged and is deeply

dissected. The largest stream in the study area! is the

Great Miami River, which flows in a flat valley about 2

miles wide at an altitude of 200-350 feet below the till

plain of the upland. Major tributaries to the river in the

area are Twin Creek, Fourmile Creek, Dicks Creek, Elk

Creek, Sevenmile Creek, Indian Creek, and the White-

water River.

\

CLIMATE

The occurrence and the distribution of precipitation

govern the regimens of both surface water and ground

water. Hence, an understanding the area's climate is

fundamental.

:

Southwestern Ohio has a climate which is generally

classified as humid temperate. Table 1 gives a sum-

mary of normal monthly precipitation in the area, and

table 2 summarizes monthly normal temperatures. The

Cincinnati and Dayton stations are not in the area of

investigation but are included because they are the only

nearby first-order weather stations. The Cincinnati and

Dayton stations are in the uplands, whereas the Hamil-

ton and Middletown stations are in the Great Miami

River valley. Annual precipitation averages 36-40 inches and is

evenly distributed throughout the year. Much of the

summer precipitation, however, is in the form of scat-

tered thundershowers. Areal variation in precipitation

may therefore be large. Distribution of these; local

storms tends to average out over a long period of record,

as shown by the consistent records for the four stations

given in table 1. Precipitation in the spring and summer

(March-August) slightly exceeds precipitation in the

autumn and winter (September-February). Average

monthly precipitation for the four listed stations is 3.64

Average annual temperature for the three listed stations is 54° F. The average maximum is 87.5° F and the average minimum is 22.2° F. Extreme recorded temperatures for the 1931-60 period of record. are 109 F° and
17° F, both at Cincinnati. Temperatures above 100° F or below 10° F are rare. The average length of the growing season, or frost-free period, is 170 days (Pierce, 1959, fig. 34).
Although, precipitation is fairly evenly distributed throughout the year, . recharge to the aquifers is not. During the growing season, which is mainly the 6-month
period from mid-April to mid-October, most precipita-
tion is lost through evapotranspiration and does not reach the water table. During the winter, freezing of the
ground prevents precipitation from reaching the water table. Thus, the most probable times for ground-water recharge are in the late fall and the early spring that is

October and November, and March and April. Precipitation in March and April slightly exceeds that in October and November; therefore, March and April appear to be the optimum months for recharge. This deduction, though generally valid, does not hold true after year after because climatic conditions may vary greatly from year to year. With rare exceptions, however, most of the ground-water recharge occurs during the 7-month interval October-April.

POPULATION
The predominantly urban population of the lower Great Miami River valley has steadily increased during the past half century. The study area includes parts of four counties Butler, Hamilton, Montgomery, and Warren. Table 3 gives the population of these four counties at 10-year intervals from 1900 to 1960, the latest year for which Federal census data are available. Only about 15 percent of this population lives within the study area but almost everyone in these four counties is dependent to some extent on ground water from the lower Great Miami River valley. The ground-water resource of the report area sustains a substantial part of the industrial base of these four counties and is a potential source of public water supplies for cities outside the report area. Thus, for purposes of the present report,
the total population of the four counties is more meaningful than that of the actual report area. About twothirds of the inhabitants of these four counties live in the Cincinnati and Dayton metropolitan areas, and neither city is within the study area.

The population of the study area alone is difficult to determine, for the area boundaries do not coincide with political boundaries and hence, with census data. The area's approximate population in 1960 based on the cities and. townships which the area comprises, was 255,000. The largest cities in the area, according to 1960 population records, are Hamilton (72,354) , Middletown (42,115), Miamisburg (9,893), and Fairfield (9,734). .
The population of the lower Great Miami River valley seems destined to continue its growth in future years. Between 1900 and 1950 the population of the four-

SV6 GROUND WATER IN THE LOWER GREAT MIAMI RIVER VALLEY, OHIO

county area doubled. Over a comparable period, from .1910 to 1960, the population of the study area increased at an even greater rate from 84,036 to 254,529 (or more than triple the 1910 population). Conservative estimates indicate that the population of the United States will double in the next 50 years. As the area of investigation is in a region of rapidly expanding industrial development, its population can be -expected to grow at an even greater rate.
COMMERCE, INDUSTRY, AND TRANSPORTATION
Almost since pioneer days in the history of Ohio, the Great Miami River valley has been an important industrial center. Paper mills sprang up early along the river at Miamisburg, Franklin, Middletown, and Hamilton, owing largely to the river being a'source of power and an avenue of transportation. The Miami and Erie Canal, linking the Great Lakes with the Ohio River, was completed in 1.845. It provided the area with the most mod.ern transportation available at the time.
Water has been largely responsible for the area's steady industrial growth and is destined to play an increasingly important role in the future. Although the earliest factories were built along the river and utilized surface-water supplies, industries have depended largely on ground water during the past 50 years, owing to its abundance arid superior quality, and to the advent of modern techniques in well construction. Much surface water is still used for cooling, but ground water plays the dominant role in the area's industrial economy. The large ground-water supplies still virtually untapped in piarts of the area give the Great Miami River valley great potential for future industrial development.
At present the lower Great Miami valley is served by the Baltimore & Ohio, Chesapeake & Ohio, and PennCentral Railroads.1 Airports at Cincinnati and Dayton provide the nearest access to major air carriers; smaller airfields at Hamilton and Middletown are served by charter flights. Interstate Route 75 skirts the Great Miami River valley and provides ready access along its route from Cincinnati to Dayton. Interstate Route 74 passes through the valley near Miamitown, en route from Cincinnati to Indianapolis.

these valuable resources to form. Water, on' the other hand, is continually replenished- in the form of precipitation. Actually, Water exists in a perenially repeating cycle. Of the water that falls on the ground as various types of precipitation, some runs off to streams and, thence, to the oceans; some also soaks into the ground. Of the water that soaks into the ground, some percolates downward to the water table and is stored in underground reservoirs, and some is returned to the atmosphere through evaporation and through transpiration from plants. Surface-water bodies also lose water through evaporation into the atmosphere. Generally, the amount of water which evaporates into the atmosphere approximately equals that which returns as precipitation. This endlessly repeating cycle is known as the hydrologic cycle, and an understanding of it:is basic to any .hydrologic investigation. Readers interested in a more detailed description of the hydrologic cycle in general terms are referred to Leopold and Langbein (1960, p. 3-1.1).
The aquifer or the medium consisting of rocks and unconsolidated matter, that stores and transmits ground water is equally as important as the hydrologic cycle in an area! appraisal of the ground-water resource. Not all materials have equal capacity to store and transmit water, however. Thus, an understanding of the areal distribution and transmission characteristics (in short, the geology) of the area's rock materials is also fundamental. Interaction of the aquifer with the hydrologic cycle is here referred to as the "hydrologic system," a mutually dependent system consisting of all the components described above. No single component of the hydrologic system can be disturbed or altered without ultimately affecting the entire system.
CHARACTER AND ORIGIN OF THE AQUIFERS
The large ground-water supplies of the lower .Great Miami River valley occur in highly permeable sand and gravel that were deposited by glacial melt waters from receding continental ice sheets. These materials were
deposited in channels which had been cut deeply into bedrock by interglackl streams. Plates 1 and 2 show the general location of the principal water-bearing sand and gravel formations, referred to in this report as aquifers. These aquifers are variously called valley-train deposits, valley fill, glacial outwash, water course aquifers, or buried-valley aquifers. The geologic history of the area is complex, but its highlights can be summarized briefly. The bedrock which underlies the entire area consists predominantly of flat-lying shale with thin interbedded layers of limestone. This rock unit, known as the Cincinnatian Series, was deposited about 450 million years ago during the late. Ordovician Period in a shallow sea,

GROUND-WATER HYDROLOGY AND GEOLOGY

probably under conditions similar to those now prevailing on the Continental Shelf. The total thickness of the Cincinnatian Series is about 800 feet. These shales and limestones have a low permeability; the small amount of water that does occur in them is in joints and cracks, whose distribution is erratic.* Although the permeability of these rocks may be too low to sustain large water yields from wells, the large area of shale in contact with sand and gravel aquifers possibly contributes a significant quantity of water to the aquifers.
Several times during the Pleistocene Epoch, which comprised the last 21/2-3 million years before the Holocene (Recent) Epoch, Ohio was in large part covered by continental ice sheets. Of the four recognized major glaciations, three, possibly four (Ray, 1966), invaded the lower Great Miami River valley. Each ice sheet blanketed the area with glacial till, which is a' tough, poorly-sorted aggregate with a predominantly clay matrix containing pebbles, cobbles, and boulders that, in the lower Great Miami River valley, are largely limestone. This glacial till, like the shale bedrock, is nearly impermeable although water is locally present in pockets 'and lenses of sand and gravel within the till.
As a result of the Pleistocene glaciations, impermeable bedrock was blanketed by equally impermeable till. In the valleys, however, glacial outwash deposits
of the last glaciation of Wisconsin age, and perhaps those of the next older glaciation of Illinoian age, form the most potentially productive water-bearing deposits in the Midwest. During one or more of the interglacial ages the valley that is in general followed by the present Great Miami, became entrenched in bedrock to 'depths of 200 feet or more. The filling of glacial outwash, consisting mainly of well-sorted sand and gravel, was deposited in the entrenched valley by the torrential meltwaters of the younger ice sheets. Till, interstratified with the permeable outwash sand and gravel in the valleys, has produced confining layers of lower permeability.
GROUND WATER IN THE HYDROLOGIC SYSTEM
. The Great Miami River valley has an abundant supply of water owing to both the high storage capacity of the valley-train aquifers and the high average annual rainfall of about 40 inches. Because of such plentiful recharge and storage, the sustained dry-weather flow of the Great Miami River is one of the highest in Ohio. The mean discharge of the river at Hamilton is 3,323 cfs (cubic feet per second), and the discharge equaled or exceeded 90 percent of the time is 490 cfs (Cross and Hedges, 1959, p. 147). The latter figure is considered by many hydrologists to be a good index of a stream's sustained dry-weather flow. The Great

Miami River's high dry-weather flow, or base flow, is due largely to the high permeability and storage capacity of the sand and gravel deposits which underlie much of the streambed. Ground water in these deposits is hydraulically connected with the river. Under natural conditions the gradient is from the aquifer to the river; therefore, ground water discharges into the river. In periods of little or no precipitation, streamflow results almost entirely from ground-water discharge. (See Cross and Hedges, 1959, p. 5-13.)
Man has influenced the hydrologic cycle in the lower Great Miami River valley. The most readily apparent effect of man's activity on the relationship of ground water and surface water is the reversal of the natural hydraulic gradient caused by pumping ground water from the sand and gravel aquifers. Where and when the rate of pumping is great enough for the cone of depression to intersect the river, the hydraulic gradient is reversed, and water is induced to infiltrate from the river into the aquifer. About 110 million gallons of water are pumped from the aquifer each day in the report area. Most of this pumping is concentrated around the cities of Middletown, Hamilton, and Franklin, where the hydraulic gradient has been reversed. Though man has altered the hydrologic cycle, he does not permanently remove water from the system. He has merely changed the path that water takes through the system.2 . Although the hydrologic system of the lower Great Miami River valley has here been described in very general terms, the hydrologic regimen of this area in its present state as well as its possible future trends requires a more detailed analysis of its complexities to be fully understood. Therefore, the environments in which ground water occurs in the lower Great Miami River valley are described next.
HYDROGEOLOGIC ENVIRONMENTS
The characteristics of the sand and gravel aquifers are far from uniform throughout the lower Great Miami River valley. By geologic mapping it is possible to differentiate aquifer'units, each with its distinctive physical properties. The occurrence of ground water is further complicated by differences in aquifers' potential for recharge by induced infiltration, which are usually not considered in conventional geologic1 .mapping. A somewhat broader concept is needed to define these important area! variations in the occurrence of ground water.
2 These remarks refer to the hydrologic system In the lower Great Miami River valley as a whole, and not'to any specific locality. The aquifers have been overdrawn locally; the extent'and the consequences of this local overdraft are discussed in Professional Paper 605-D (Spieker, 1968b).

A8 GROUND WATER IN THE LOWER GREAT MIAMI RIVER VAiLLEY, OHIO

The concept of "hydrogeologic environment" was introduced in the present investigation to broaden the usual scope of geologic mapping. A hydrogeologic environment is here defined as a mappable area whose underlying aquifer materials possess distinct hydrologic and geologic properties that differ significantly from the properties of .aquifers in the adjacent areas. In other words, ground water occurs under essentially uniform hydrologic and geologic conditions within any given hydrogeologic environment. The term "hydrogeologic environment" owes its origin to the relatively new interdisciplinary science of hydrogeology, which deals with the geology and hydrology of ground water. Hydrogeologic mapping or the mapping of hydrogeologic environments thus somewhat .broadens the scope of conventional geologic mapping.
The lower Great Miami River valley has been classified into 11 different hydrogeologic environments, which are as follows:

Valley-train deposits
I. Sand and gravel aquifer; recharge by induced stream infiltration potentially available.
A. No interstratified clay layers present. 1. Aquifer 150-200 feet or more thick. 2. Aquifer.less than 150 feet thick.
B. Interstratified clay layers possibly present. 1. Aquifer 150-200 feet or more thick. 2. Aquifer less than 150 feet thick.
II. Sand and gravel aquifer; no recharge by induced stream infiltration available.
A. No interstratified clay layers present. 1. Aquifer 150-200 feet or more thick. 2. Aquifer less than 150 feet thick.
B. Interstratified clay layers possibly present. 1. Aquifer 150-200 feet or more thick. 2. Aquifer less than 150 feet thick.
III. Sand and gravel aquifer overlain by clay; stream recharge generally not available.
IV. Valleys filled largely or entirely with clay; large water supplies generally not available.

Upland areas

V. Shale bedrock overlain by glacial till; large water supplies

generally not available.

.

The four principal criteria on which this classification is based are nature of the aquifer, availability of recharge by induced stream infiltration, presence or absence of interstratified clay layers, and thickness of the aquifer unit. The above outline is arranged in order of generally decreasing potential for the development of large ground-water supplies. - Should more detailed

work in the future make possible a more detailed classification, the expanded classification can easily be fitted

into the framework in the outline j list given. The following discussion of hydrogeologic environ-
ments in the lower Great Miami River valley is based

on the hydrogeologic map of the area and a series of geologic sections (pis. 1, 2). The sections are consecutively designated by letters (A-A', B-B', and so on) beginning in the northern part of the area, but are discussed in the order given in the above outline. The boundaries between the environments (pis. 1, 2) are generalized, as is implied by the dashed lines. The contacts, as shown on maps in this report- represent the best generalizations which can be made on the basis of available data. Further investigations may reveal information that will permit some refinement of this map.
ENVIRONMENT I-A-1
[Sand and gravel aquifer 150-200 feet or more thick; no interstratified clay layers present; stream recharge available]
The most favorable environment for the development of large ground-water supplies in the lower Great Miami River valley is in those areas where 150 feet or more of sand and gravel with no retarding clay layers are sufficiently close to the river to permit induced recharge by stream infiltration. This hydrogeologic environment, designated I-A-1, occurs in three parts of the report area (pis. 1, 2) : the vicinity of Trenton, immediately southwest of Middletown; that part of the valley from a point north of New Miami, through Hamilton and Eairfield, to a point west of Ross; and the lower Whitewater River valley, southeast of Harrison. Several of the largest ground-water supplies in the lower Great Miami River valley are in this environment at New Miami, Hamilton, Fairfield, and Ross but the aquifer in much of this highly favorable territory remains untapped.
The 'coefficient of transmissibility (T) of the aquifer in evironment I-A-1 ranges generally from 300,000 to 500,000 gpd per ft (gallons per day per foot). The coefficient of storage (<#) is about 0.2, indicating that the water is unconfined. Properly constructed individual wells can yield 3,000 gpm (gallons per minute) or more and have specific capacities of as much as 300 gpm per foot of drawdown.
The geologic sections on plate 2 show the significant characteristics of hydrogeologic environment I-A-1. Section E-E' (pi. 2)' is in the western part of the Hamilton South well field, about 1 mile east of -the site of a new well field proposed by the city of Cincinnati. Here the buried, valley of the ancestral Great Miami River is about 2 miles wide. Its floor is nearly flat and its bedrock walls are steep. Although no areally extensive clay layers appear to be present, a distinct layer of finegrained materials,, consisting of sand and silt, can be identified in the lower part of the valley fill.
Section G-G' (pi. 2) is representative of conditions in the lower Whitewater River valley. As yet, data from

GROUND-WATER HYDROLOGY AND GEOLOGY

wells are rather scarce in this area for little development of the ground-water resource has been done. Control on the bedrock surface for this cross'section is based on results of a seismic refraction survey. The lenses of clay shown are diagrammatic and indicate that widely scattered lenses and stringers of fine-grained material may be present anywhere in the valley fill. These lenses are not, however, of sufficient thickness or areal extent to act as semiconfining layers or to otherwise affect the general movement of the ground water in the area.
The bedrock floor of the buried Whitewater River valley is flat and the walls are steep, just as they are in the Fairfield area (pi. 2). The Whitewater River valley ranges in width from 1 to ll/2 miles in the reach between Harrison and Elizabethtown; the valley in this reach is somewhat narrower than Great Miami River valley at Fairfield. The Whitewater River valley in the study area has undergone only little ground-water development and, indeed, has all the characteristics favorable to such development; therefore, it is one of the most promising parts of the lower Great Miami River valley for future development of ground-water supplies.
RECHARGE BY INDUCED STREAM INFILTRATION
The key factor in sustaining the large ground-water supplies in hydrogeologic environment I--A-1 is the
availability of recharge by induced stream infiltration. The rate of such recharge varies widely with respect to both place and time and depends on many factors, such as stream discharge, stream velocity, condition of the streambed, temperature of the stream .water, and the hydraulic gradient in the aquifier. Induced infiltration, despite its major role in the hydrologic system, is, nonetheless, one of the least understood phenomena. That it is not more clearly understood can be partly attributed to the fact that meaningful results are obtainable only with fairly large expenditures of time and funds. Induced infiltration in the lower Great Miami River valley certainly should receive future study.
Probably the most comprehensive study of stream infiltration induced by pumping of ground water was made by Rorabaugh (1956) in the alluvial deposits of the Ohio River, valley in northeastern Louisville, Ky. Rorabaugh (p. 117-125) derived several equations for the determination of infiltration characteristics, and these equations have become the basis of most subsequent infiltration studies.
Most induced recharge occurs during periods of high streamflow. This phenomenon can be attributed to three causes:
1. The higher stream velocities associated with high streamflow tend to keep the fine-grained particles (such as clay and silt) in suspension, and the

resultant streambed is composed mainly of sand and gravel and is conducive to infiltration. 2. The head differential between water in the stream and water in the underlying aquifier is greater at high streamflow than at low flow, and leads to increased infiltration. 3. The wetted area of the streambed is generally larger at high streamflow.
No independent analysis of these three factors has been made to ascertain their relative importance.
Although most induced recharge occurs at. high streamflow, a large amount is also known to occur during periods of sustained low streamflow. It is the amount of recharge during periods of low streamflow that is critical in sustaining large ground-water supplies during prolonged drought .periods; therefore, most streaminfiltration studies have emphasized these periods.
Dove (1961, p. 62-66),determined the rate of induced infiltration at the well field of the Southwestern Ohio Water Co. near Ross in hydrogeologic environment I-A-1 by use of a flow-net'analysis based on waterlevel measurements made on August 31,1956. The company's two horizontal collectors (wells 73 and 77) were being pumped at a combined rate of 16.9 mgd (million gallons per day). The average discharge of Great Miami River at Hamilton on that day.was 587 cfs, a rate ex-
ceeded about 85 percent of the time and considered to be representative of low streamflow. The average infiltration rate for the affected reach of the river was calculated to be 240,000 gpd (gallons per day) per acre of streambed. The maximum infiltration rate, however, was considerably higher. On the basis of the determined rate of 115,000 gpd per 'acre per foot of head loss, the infiltration rate at the point where the maximum of 6.37 feet of head loss was measured was 735,000 gpd per acre of streambed.
Another determination of the average infiltration rate in the lower Great Miami River valley was made during a pumping test conducted by the city of Cincinnati on June 26-29, 1962, at a site in Fairfield township of Butler County, about half way between the Southwestern Ohio Water Co. well and the Hamilton South well field. The test site is near the location of Cincinnati's proposed well field. R. C. Smith (written commun. to the city of Cincinnati, 1962) calculated an average infiltration rate of 492,000 gpd per acre for a reach of about 1,800 feet of streambed at the site of the test, during which well 63 was pumped at 3,000 gpm for 3 days. The results of this test are discussed in chapter C of the present series (Spieker, 1968a, p. C5-C9). Discharge of Great Miami River at Hamilton ranged from 676 to 624 cfs, a range exceeded over 75 percent of the time (Cross and Hedges, 1959, p. 147).

A10

GROUND WATER IN THE LOWER GREAT MIAMI RIVER VALLEY, OHIO

Although the two estimates of stream infiltration rate are of the same order of magnitude, this does not indicate that the phenomenon of stream infiltration in the Great Miami Kiver valley is adequately understood. Both determinations were made in hydrogeologically similar terrains and under similar streamflow conditions^ The hydrologic regimen in the lower Great Miami River valley presents such a wide range of conditions that two determinations, alone, are not representative of it.
Temperature is one of the variables -that affect infiltration rates. Both the above determinations were made during the summer, when temperature of the river water was about 80°F. During the winter the river temperature is as low as 33°F. Inasmuch as the viscosity of water varies inversely with temperature, the permeability of a medium varies inversely with viscosity of the water it contains. A decrease in the temperature of the river water reduces the effective permeability of the streambed materials and thus inhibits recharge. A decrease of river temperature of 1°F would decrease the infiltration rate by. about 1.5 percent. Therefore, the infiltration rate for river water at 40 °F would be reduced by 60 percent from its value of 80°F. However, the reduction of the infiltration rate caused by lowered temperature is at least partly offset by the generally 4^1>er. streamflow that:o)?curs during the colder months p.f ,the year. Much additional research on the temperature-infiltration-rate relationship is needed:
"'-;; .,'.' EVIDENCE OF INDUCED STREAM INFILTRATION
'."- 'Although recharge by induced stream infiltration is generally acknowledged by hydrologists, some scientists

have expressed the opinion that much of the recharge

attributed to induced infiltration is actually the result

of ground-water runoff that is diverted from its normal

path toward a stream. Indeed, diversion of ground-

water runoff can produce the same 'effect as induced

recharge from .a stream; however, two examples in the

lower Great Miami River valley can be cited as evidence

that water actually has been induced to flow from the

stream into the aquifer. Evidence of the first example

is based on changes in the ground-water temperature

during ,an aquifer test, and of the second, on a progres-

sive change in the quality of water over a period of

years.

During the previously mentioned aquifer test, con-

ducted by the city of Cincinnati in June 1962, tempera-

ture-depth logs of several observation wells were made

by using a thermister-type thermometer. The tempera-

ture logging technique has been discussed in detail by

Morris and Spieker (1962).

All

50-foot depth in well 62 indicates that river water has infiltrated the aquifer.
The second example of induced stream infiltration is a progressive change in the chemical quality of the water from Southwestern Ohio Water Co. collector 1 (well 77 in present report) near Boss. Table 4 gives selected results from seven chemical analyses of samples taken at the collector near Ross over a 13-year period, arid results of similar analyses of water from Great Miami River at Hamilton. The first sample from collector 1 was taken July 11, 1952, shortly after the collector was placed in operation; the most recent sample included in the present analysis was collected February 16, 1965. These analyses show that a distinct and progressive increase in the concentration of sulfate, from 38 mg/1 (milligrams per liter) in 1952 to 121 mg/1 in 1965, occurred during this 13-year period, during which the collector was pumped at rates of 5-10 mgd. Equally notable increases in the concentrations of chloride, hardness, and dissolved solids occurred. The temperature of water in the collector increased from. 54° F in 1952 to 63° F in 1965. A comparison of these analyses from the collector with three selected analyses from Great Miami River at Hamilton also given in table 4, indicates that the quality of the ground water pumped from the collector was gradually approaching
that of the water from the river during this 13-year period/Thus, it is concluded that water induced from the river mixed .with the ground water as a result of induced stream infiltration.

EFFECTS OF INDUCED RECHARGE ON STREAMFLOW
Induced stream recharge and captured ground-water runoff not only affect.the sustained yield of wells, as previously discussed, but also affect streamflow. Generally,

the withdrawal of a given amount of water from an aquifer that is hydraulically connected with a stream will eventually reduce the flow of the stream between the point of withdrawal and the point of return by an amount approximately equal to the amount withdrawn. However, this reduction in flow will generally occur whether the water entering the well comes from induced stream recharge or from captured ground-water runoff.
This relationship between withdrawals from wells and reduction in streamflow is generally obscured or overlooked for three reasons:
1. The point of return is usually so close to the point of withdrawal that the effect cannot be readily detected.
2. Ground water in storage acts as a "buffer," sometimes delaying the effect of pumping on streamflow.
3. For a stream with as high a sustained flow as the Great Miami River, the rate of ground-water withdrawal at any single locality is usually very small in comparison with the rate of streamflow; also, most streamflow losses to induced infiltration .occur during periods of high flow, when they are difficult to .detect.
To measure losses in streamflow caused by groundwater withdraAval in the area of investigation would be. difficult for the above reasons. .Studies have been made,
however, in the Dayton area, immediately north of the study area. Conditions for measuring streamflow losses are more favorable in the Dayton area because much of the ground-water withdrawal is concentrated in. the
O"
northeastern and central parts of the city; the flow of the Great Miami River is not as great in this area as it is farther downstream; and the principal sewage plant, which returns used water to the river, is in southwest Dayton, downstream from several of the' principal pumping centers.
Cross and Hedges (1959, p. 52) mentioned that, on the basis of long-term averages, there is a loss in streamflow in the Great Miami River through Dayton approximately equal to the quantity of effluent discharged from the Dayton sewage-treatment plant. All water supply for Dayton comes from a ground-water source, and one can thus assume that the ground-water withdrawals cause'the reduction in streamflow.
A detailed analysis of the effects of ground-water withdrawal on streamflow in the Dayton area during a' period of low flow was described by Norris and Spieker (1966, p. 88-92). On October 4,1960, discharge measurements'were made at eight sites on the Great Mi-
ami and Mad Rivers. A net loss of 105.4 cfs, or 68 mgd, occurred between Mad River at. Huffman Dam and the Great Miami River 1 mile north of Holes Creek (Norris

is on the quality of water; the water returned to the river is generally of lower quality and of higher temperature than naturally occurring ground water.

study area (pi, 1) is underlain by sand and gravel with one or more interstratified layers of clay. Those parts

The second most favorable hydrogeologic environment in the lower Great Miami Kiver valley consists of those areas where the sand and gravel aquifer is 150 feet or less thick, has no areally extensive clay layers, and is sufficiently close to a major stream to be recharged by induced infiltration. This environment is present chiefly along two reaches of the Great Miami River (pis 1, 2); one, between Trenton and New Miami, and the other, between New Baltimore and Cleves. Hydrogeologic environment I-A-2 also occurs adjacent to environment I-A-1 along the edges of the buried valley; for example, along the walls of the Great Miami Kiver valley southwest of Hamilton, between Fairfield and Ross.
Section H-H' (pi. 2) displays the main characteristics of hydrogeologic environment I-A-2. This section is at the Gulf Oil Co. refinery near Cleves. Here the sand and gravel aquifer is about 100 feet thick. The buried valley is slightly less than a mile wide but has virtually the same configuration (flat floor and steep walls) as does the wider, and deeper valley in the Hamilton area. (Compare with sections E-E' and #-#', pi. 2.) The valley fill consists mainly of sand and gravel, with a thin clay layer (probably weathered bedrock) immedi-
ately overlying the bedrock. The transmissibility of the aquifer in hydrogeologic
environment I-A-2 ranges from 100,000 to 300,000 gpd per ft. The storage coefficient is about 0.2. Individual

of the valley where the sand and gravel aquifer is more than 150 feet thick and where recharge by induced stream infiltration is potentially available are designated as hydrogeologic environment I-B-1. This environment is also characteristic of much of the Dayton area,'to the north. The characteristics of the valley-fill aquifer in the Dayton area have been described in detail by Norris and Spieker (1966, p. 33).
The best example of hydrogeologic environment I-B-1 is in the central part of Middletown, near the Middletown Water Works. Section B-B' (pi. 1) shows the generalized geology of this area. Here the valley-train deposits are separated into two distinct aquifers by a layer of clay 50 feet or more thick. Other clay layers are scattered through the section. The upper aquifer is typically about 50 feet thick but ranges in thickness from 30 to 70 feet. The lower aquifer is typically dbout 100 feet thick. The slope of the bedrock valley walls is less steep and the floor is less flat than in the Hamilton area. (Compare section B-B', pi. 1, with section E-Ef , pi. 2.) The deepest part of the buried valley, below an altitude of 400 feet, is inferred from seismic refraction surveys. The deepest known well in the Middletown area is a test well at the Armco East Works which reached bedrock
at an altitude of 408 feet, The coefficients of transmissibility and storage in
environment I-B-1 were not determined during the present investigation. Norris (1959, p. 7), however, de: termined that the transmissibility of the lower aquifer

which overlies the valley-train aquifer, there is another clay layer about 10 feet thick which divides the aquifer into two parts at that site. The test indicated that the transmissibility of the lower half of the aquifer is 150,000 gpd per ft.; therefore, the transmissibility of the entire aquifer is estimated to be about 300,000 gpd per ft.
The transmissibility of the aquifer in the vicinity of the Armco East Works, southeast of Middletown, can be determined by flow-net analysis, as described by Bennett (in Ferris and others, 1962, p. 139-144). Where a well-defined cone of depression around a well or pump-

This was done for the area between the 540- and 560-foot contours at the Armco field (pi. 1). The average pumping rate at Armco is 10 mgd. The flow-net equation, as stated bv Bennett, is:

River at Miamisburg (pi. 2) based on the adjusted period 1921-45 3 is 380 cfs, or 0.140 cfs per sq. mi. The adjusted mean discharge at Miamisburg is 2,217 cfs. For Great Miami River at Hamilton (pi. 2), the 90-percent, discharge for the adjusted period 1921-45 is 490 cfs, or 0.135 cfs per sq. mi., whereas the adjusted mean discharge is 3,323 cfs. Because the Hamilton station is the nearest regular gaging station to the mouth of the river, it is probably the best available index to streamflow in the Great Miami River basin as a whole.
The high base flow in the lower Great Miami River is largely due to the vast expanse of highly permeable outwash plain deposits in the upper part of the basin, particularly in the Mad River basin. These deposits, though probably not more permeable than the valley-fill aquifers in 'the lower Great Miami River valley, are more areally extensive in that they are spread out over a broad outwash plain rather than confined to a buried channel. Mad River near Springfield has 90-percent discharge of 152 cfs, somewhat lower than the 90-percent discharges at Miamisburg and Hamilton. The drainage area of this station, however, is only 485 square miles. The 90-percent discharge of 0.313 cfs per sq mi (Cross and Hedges, 1959, p. 143) is the highest for any major stream in Ohio.
The high sustained flow of the Great Miami River, though a direct result of the Abundance of ground water, is also of direct benefit in sustaining large ground-water supplies. This high flow makes possible the widespread availability of recharge by induced infiltration, and without it, most of the area's large ground-water supplies would not be sustained.
PUMPAGE OF GROUND WATER
The various hydrogeologic environments of the lower Great Miami River valley can be regarded as components in the 'physical framework of the hydrological system. Under natural conditions the hydrologic cycle operates within this framework in a state of near equilibrium 'that is, the total inflow generally equals the total outflow. During approximately the past 100 years, however, man has upset this state of equilibrium by his removal (pumping) of water from the system. Thus, man has brought about significant changes in the hydrologic system. One of the major purposes of the present report is to evaluate the effects of these changes caused by pumping with respect to both place and time. Before this evaluation can be made, however, the magnitude
3 Since the periods of record of all gaging stations are not the same, the duration data from gaging stations must be adjusted to a "standard" period of record. This adjustment is accomplished by comparison of the duration data of one station -with similar data for another station for the standard period of record. Cross and Hedges (1959, p. 16-19) described this adjustment procedure with several examples. The standard adjusted period for Ohio streams is 1921-45.

DISTRIBUTION AND MAGNITUDE OF GROUND-WATEK
PUMPAGE IN 1964
During the present study an inventory was made of the major users of ground water in the lower Great Miami River valley. This inventory was to update an earlier inventory made in 1954 by the Miami Conservancy District. The results of the later inventory are given in table 7.
Distribution of pumpage is also shown on plates 1 and 2 by circles of appropriate magnitude.
Although the pumpage of 'all municipal supplies is metered, many industries do not keep records of their ground-water pumpage. Thus, the pumpage at many plants could only be estimated. The figures shown in table 7 are averages; the actual pumping rates vary considerably from day to day. Pumpage from domestic and farm wells is not included in the present survey. Also, some small industrial supplies may have been overlooked; however, these omitted supplies are probably of insignificant magnitude when compared with the total municipal and industrial pumpage in the area.

Total municipal and industrial pumpage in the lower Great Miami River valley in 1964, according to the present inventory, was 110 mgd. The three greatest concentrations of .pumpage are the central Middletown area, with 22 mgd; the area including New Miami and the northern part of Hamilton, with 18 mgd; and the Southwestern Ohio Water Co. well field near Ross, with

15 mgd. Other major users of ground water are the Armco East Works in southeast Middletown, with 10 mgd; the Hamilton South well field, with 8 mgd; and the Gulf Oil Co. refinery near Cleves, with 7 mgd. In general, the greatest centers of pumping are concentrated at and around the area's principal cities. (See plates 1 and 2.) The ground-water resources in much of rural part of the area have not yet been tapped.
HISTORICAL PUMPING TRENDS
Ground-water pumpage rates in the lower Great Miami Kiver valley have increased steadily from the beginning of the area's settlement to the present and can be expected to increase in the future. No documentation exists of the exact rate at which pumpage has increased. In general, though, the rate of ground-water pumpage in 1964 is estimated to be approximately double the rate immediately prior to World War II. Pumpage in the report area increased from 90 mgd in 1954, the year the Miami Conservancy District made its inventory, to 110 mgd in 1964, when the present study was made. The Hamilton municipal water supply, for example, had an average pumping rate of about 4 mgd in 1940 compared with 8 mgd in 1964. Pumpage at the Middletown Water Works also increased, from 3 mgd in 1940 to 8 mgd in 1964. Some of the largest ground-water supplies in the area are of recent origin. The Southwestern Ohio Water Co. well field near Eoss and the Atomic Energy Commission's installation near Fernald, for example, were both put into operation in 1952. The steady increase in ground-water pumpage can be attributed to several factors, such as increasing population, increasing industrial output, and the ever-increasing per-capita water demand.
FUTURE USE OF THE GROUND-WATER RESOURCE
The factors which have caused ground-water pumpage to increase in the past are certain to exist in the future. The Great Miami River valley appears to be destined for increased industrialization which will bring more people and manufacturing plants into the area,
further increasing the water demand. Conservative estimates are that the rate of water use in this area will be double the 1964 rate by the year 2000.
The capacity of the hydrologic system to sustain such an increased draft is discussed in chapters C and D of the current series (Spieker, 1968 a, b). An analogmodel study of the Fairfield-New Baltimore area (Spieker, 1968a) indicates that the hydrologic system in this reach of the Great Miami River valley can sustain a total initial withdrawal of 84 mgd, or nearly four times the present rate. This determination is the basis for the estimate presented in Professional Paper 605-

D (Spieker, 1968b) that the ground-water system in the lower Great Miami River valley can sustain a total initial withdrawal of 300 mgd, or about three times the present rate.
The initial withdrawal should not, however, be regarded as a limit on the development of the groundwater resource. Because most of the water withdrawn from the aquifers is returned to the river as sewage, the net depletion of streamflow is slight. Therefore, pumping of ground water does not substantially reduce the amount of stream water available for induced recharge; in effect, water could be recycled many times from the aquifer to the point of use, to the river (as sewage), and thence back to the aquifer (as induced recharge). Such recycling would be limited by either the deterioration in quality of the used water or the cost of treatment necessary to maintain adequate water quality in the streams and aquifers.
AREAL CONFIGURATION OF THE GROUND-WATER SURFACE
The effects of pumping should be studied with respect to both place and time. A map of the ground-water surface, generally known as the piezometric surface, shows the areal effects of pumping. The configuration of this surface is the resultant of the two variables the hydrogeologic environment and the effects of pumping which have been discussed in the preceding sections dealing with the different parts of the study area. The hydrograph of an observation well expresses the resultant of these variables with respect to time. The configuration of the water surface with respect to place is considered first.
Contours representing the water surface in midOctober 1964 are shown on plates 1 and 2. The contours on plates 1 and 2 are based on 57 water-level measurements made during the period October 12-15,1964. In addition to these actual measurements, 23 projected* water levels were used in the construction of 'the contours. These projections were derived by adjustment of earlier water-level measurements to October 1964,
based on their comparison with the hydrographs of nearby observation wells in similar hydrogeologic environments. Discharge of Great Miami River at Hamilton during this 4-day period averaged 317 cfs, a value exceeded more than 95 percent of the time (based on the adjusted period 1921-45). These measurements are representative of ground-water conditions under conditions of extremely low streamflow. The contours represent surfaces of equal ground-water potential. Ground water moves perpendicular to these contours in the direction of decreasing potential. Therefore, the movement of ground water in the lower Great Miami River valley

GROUND-WATER HYDROLOGY AND GEOLOGY

is generally toward the south and southwest. The hydraulic gradient in the aquifer is about 5-10 feet per mile, in the same general range as the hydraulic gradient of the Great Miami River. In three areas the present course of the river deviates from the course of the ancestral river. Thus, in these areas the sand-andgravel-filled buried valleys are now river-abandoned troughs. These three troughs are between West Carrollton and Carlisle (pi. 1), between Trenton and New Miami (pi. 1), and between Fernald and Harrison (pi. 2). In each of these abandoned troughs is a groundwater divide (pis. 1, 2), from which ground water flows, in both directions, to the junctions of the abandoned troughs with the present river valley.
Cones of depression have developed around the centers of pumping at Miamisburg, Chautauqua, Franklin, Middletown, New Miami, Hamilton, Fairfield, Eoss, Fernald, and Cleves. Only the cone in the Middletown area, largely the result of pumping at the Armco East Works, is of major proportions. Some of the cones, such as those at Franklin and the Atomic Energy Commission plant near Fernald, are of such slight depth that they could not be shown on the map. The great depth of the cone around the Armco East Works is the result of heavy pumping in an area where the aquifer has a relatively low transmissibility and no available recharge
by induced stream infiltration. The contours of the ground-water surface on plates
1 and 2 are generalized to the extent that where the sand and gravel aquifer is separated by clay layers into two or more units, the water level of only the lower unit is represented. The lower unit was selected for two reasons : more data are available for this unit, and by far most of the ground water in the area is pumped from the lower aquifer. Only in the pumping centers in hydrogeologic environments I-B are II-B would there be any appreciable difference between the water levels in the two units. The approximate difference in water levels in the two units is indicated by comparison of waterlevel measurements made at the Middletown Water Works well field on October 14, 1964. The water levels in wells 18 and 19, both of which are screened in the lower aquifer, were 611 and 605 feet above mean sea level, respectively. The water level in well Bu-1, screened in the upper aquifer, was 619 feet above mean sea level. Therefore at the Middletown well field there was an 8- to 14-foot head differential between the two aquifers at the time the above measurements were made.
To fully determine the effects of pumping on the water surface would require construction of a contour
map representing conditions prior to the development of large ground-water supplies in the area. Unfortunately, not enough water-level measurements are

available to construct such a map. The systematic collection of water-level data was not begun until long after large-scale pumping of ground water in the area was begun. If a map were to show contours of the groundwater surface in a nonpumping state, it would probably closely resemble those shown on plates 1 and 2, except that the cones of depression around the pumping centers would be absent.
LONG-TERM WATER-LEVEL TRENDS
The water surface does not remain static for any period of time; it constantly changes in response to natural and artificial recharge to, and discharge from, the aquifer. Thus, much can be learned about the hydrologic regimen of an area from the long-term records of waterlevel fluctuations.
Generally the ground-water surface in the lower Great Miami River valley is about 15-50 feet beneath the valley floor. The only major exceptions are in parts of the river-abandoned troughs and in the vicinity of the Armco East Works, in southeast Middletown, where heavy pumping has created a major cone of depression.
In the following section, 10 hydrographs of observation wells in the lower Great Miami River valley (figs. 3-8) are discussed with respect to the part of the study area where the wells are situated. These wells are repre-
sentative of a wide range of hydrogeologic environments and conditions of pumping and recharge. All wells are equipped with continuous water-level recorders and are maintained by the Ohio Division of Water as part of its cooperative program with the U.S. Geological Survey. Description of these wells and records of other observation wells are given in Bulletin 41 of the Ohio Department of Natural Resources, Division of Water (Kaser and Harstine, 1965).
AREA WEST OF WEST CARROLLTON
Observation well Mt-49 is at Whitfield, about 1'mile west of the Great Miami River at West Carrollton. This well, 220 feet deep, is in hydrogeologic environment I-B-1. Figure 3 shows the hydrograph of well Mt-49 for the period of record 1948-64. This well is far enough from the major pumping centers that water-level fluctuations are probably not much affected by pumping. Therefore it can be considered a good index well (responding only to natural recharge and discharge) of ground-water conditions in the area.
The hydrograph of Mt-49 (fig. 3) displays the characteristic annual cycle rising in response to recharge during the winter and spring, and falling during the summer and autumn growing season in response to natural discharge. The water level generally fluctuates 5-T feet annually. Note from figure 3 that comparatively

In 1956 Armco instituted drastic changes in their

fluctuation averaging 10-12 feet but no evident downward trend. The trend was definitely downward in 1953 and 1954; recovery in 1955 was moderate. In 1956, when the North well field was jplaced on a standby basis, the water level quickly recovered to an average of about 5 feet above the levels characteristic of the period prior to the drought of 1953-54. The hydrograph of Bu-3 similarly reflects this pumping change. The jagged pattern of the Bu-4 hydrograph from mid-1956 through 1964 reflects the intermittent use of the North well field during that period.

Observation well Bu-8 is in hydrogeologic environment III southeast of Hamilton (pi. 2). This well, 200 feet deep, is in the well field formerly operated by the Federal Works Agency. This well field was developed during World War II to supply industries in the Mill Creek valley. The FWA well field was described by Bernhagen and Schaefer (1947, p. 19-23). Although this field has been purchased by the city of Hamilton and is now known as the South well field, the wells along Gilmore Koad near well Bu-8 have not been reactivated. These wells were pumped from 1943 through the summer of 1945. The hydrograph of Bu-8 (fig. 6) shows that the water level was therefore not affected by pump-
ing, except for the brief period from the start of the record in 1944 through the summer of 1945. A recovery in the ground-water level of about 12 feet took place when pumping at the FWA well field ceased. The hydrograph of Bu-8 (fig. 6) shows a cyclic fluctuation of 10-15 feet annually. The greater magnitude of fluctuation in this well than in other wells not affected by pumping, such as Mt^49 (fig. 3) arid H-l (fig. 8), is probably the result of the low coefficient of storage
in. ;which is characteristic of hydrogeologic environment
FAIRFIELD-NEW BALTIMORE AREA .

The area between Fairfield and New Baltimore, west

of Ross, is the site of two of the largest ground-water

supplies in the lower part of the valley the Hamilton

South well field at Fairfield and the Southwestern Ohio

Water Co. well field near Ross. Midway between these

two well fields the city of Cincinnati proposes to develop

a well field which is expected to produce as much as 40

mgd. The Fairfield-New Baltimore area is the subject

of chapter C of the present series of reports (Spieker,

1968a).

.

Observation well Bu-7 is virtually in,the middle of

the Hamilton South well field (pi. 2). Its hydrograph

(fig. 7) is therefore influenced somewhat by pumping at

the field. The period of record began in 1944^ at which

time the present Hamilton South well field was being

pumped by the Federal Works Agency. The water level in Bu-7 recovered about 6 feet when pumping at the field ceased in 1945. Note the similar recovery shown by the hydrograph of Bu-8 (fig. 6). When pumping was resumed in 1956, the average water level in Bu-7 declined about 4 feet. The water level fluctuates 5-10 feet annually. Pumping at the Hamilton South well field has not caused any persistent lowering trend in the water level of Bu-7.
Observation well H-2 is about 2,000 feet from collector 1 of the Southwestern Ohio Water Co. The period of record began in 1952, when the collector was placed in operation. Its hydrograph, affected by pumping in the Southwestern Ohio well field and changes in stage of the Great Miami River, shows an 'annual cyclic fluctuation of 5-10 feet but no downward trend. Pumping alt the Southwestern Ohio well field, which averages 13-15 mgd, is sustained largely by induced recharge from the River. Dove (1961) discussed the hydrology of this well field in detail.

LOWER WHITEWATER RIVER VALLEY

. The lower valley of the Whitewater River, south of

Harrison, has been virtually unaffected by large-scale

pumping of ground water. Therefore the hydrograph of

observation well H-l (fig. 8) from 1950 to 1964 provides

an excellent record of the ground-water'regimen

unaffected by pumping. The similarity of this Hydro-

graph to the hydograph of Mt-49; (fig. 3) is striking. The

wells are in similar hydrogeologic environments ^ unaf-

fected by pumping. H-l is in hydrogeologic: environ-

ment I-A-1, and Mt-49. is in environment I-B-L' Both

wells have an annual cycle of waterflevel fluctuation of

about 5-7 feet, and neither well has shown a persistent

downward trend.

CHEMICAL QUALITY OF WATER ;

The quality of water for most'uses is fully as impor-

tant as its availability. All naturally occurring "water

contains dissolved mineral constituents in various pro-

portions 'as a result of the contact between the water and

the rocks and materials which make up the earth. Also,

in heavily populated areas water is often contaminated

as a result of the activities of man. Although surface-

water sources are generally mojre susceptible to con-

tamination than ground-water supplies, the-contamina-

tion of the latter is fairly common in densely populated

areas.

'' ' [ ;

A study of the chemical quality of ground: anil surface waters has been included in the present investiga^ tion for the above-stated reasons. The, analyses :of 30 selected ground-water samples in the area are shown in table 8. Table 9 shows nine representative analyses

GROUND WATER IN THE LOWER GREAT MIAMI RIVER VALLEY, OHIO

of water from the Great Miami Eiver in the study area. Sampling sites are shown indicated on plates 1 and 2. The U.S. Geological Survey in cooperation with various State agencies maintains a network of surface-water stations, including five in the present area, from which samples for chemical analysis are taken at regular intervals. These analyses were compiled by Hubble and Collier (1960). The analyses for each year are summarized in a series of publications by the U.S. Geological Survey; for example, see Love and others (1964).
QUALITY OF WATER
Water in the lower Great Miami Kiver valley is of a calcium bicarbonate type, with a concentration of total dissolved solids of generally 300-600 mg/1; thus, all water in the area is classed as hard to very hard. Some of the area's ground water contains objectionable quantities of iron and manganese. The presence of these minerals is generally greatest in hydrogeologic environments in which clay is abundant.
Although the quality of uncontaminated .ground water remains generally uniform, the quality of surface water fluctuates widely according to discharge. This is readily apparent in table 9, which gives results of two analyses (one representing low streamflow, and the other, high) for four of the five sites listed. The concentrations of most constituents are significantly greater at low streamflow.
EVIDENCE OF CONTAMINATION

INDIVIDUAL CONSTITUENTS AND PROPERTIES OF
WATER
The concentrations and the significance of the individual constituents and properties of ground water and surface waters given in tables 8 and 9 are discussed in the following sections.
Temperature
The temperature of ground water at depths of 200 feet or less is generally very close to the mean annual air temperature, which ranges from 52° to 55°F in the lower Great Miami River valley. Temperature of stream water, however, fluctuates from as low as 33°F in the winter to as high as 90° F in the summer. Induced infiltration of river water can therefore cause wide variance in the ground-water temperature, owing to the mixing of surface and ground waters.
The temperatures of the ground-water samples given in table 8 range from 53° to 63°F and average 56°F. All ground-water temperatures above 56°F in this area are probably the result of induced stream infiltration.
Ground water, with a uniform temperature of 53°56°F, is more desirable for public-supply use than is surface water whose temperature fluctuates over a wide range. The temperature of water to be used for industrial cooling is a critical factor. Although a groundwater supply may be the more expensive to develop, its greater utility for cooling purposes may well compensate for the additional cost.

Surface waters, and to a lesser extent ground waters, in the lower Great Miami River valley have become contaminated as a result of the activities of man. Pollution by such constituents as phenols and detergents (ABS), which do not occur in natural waters, and by high concentrations of nitrate is evident. The low dissolvedoxygen content in some reaches of the Great Miami River is further evidence of contamination. Contamination of ground water is most evident where large quantities of surface water have been induced into the aquifer as a result of pumping. Local contamination, however, can result from leakage from improperly constructed

Silica (SiO2)
Silicon is second only to oxygen as the most abundant element in the earth's crust; it occurs naturally as the silicate radical, Si04, or as silica, Si02. Though silica has a low solubility, all natural water contains small quantities of it. The silica content of ground-water samples from the study area ranged from 8.1 to 17 mg/1 and averaged 11.7 mg/1; silica in selected surface-water samples ranged from 3.4 to 9.3 mg/1 and averaged 6.6 mg/1. It can cause a hard scale to form in boilers, particularly in high-pressure boilers.
Iron (Fe)

septic tanks or from seepage of water through fertilizer on farm lands. The relatively high nitrate concentration of water from well 40 is probably the result of such causes, for the well is not in an area of heavy pumping, nor is it near enough to a major stream to be affected by induced infiltration.
Contamination of ground-water supplies, though detectable, has, as yet, been minor. The concentrations of such critical constituents as nitrate and phenols, however, should be monitored in selected wells in areas of induced infiltration so that any increase in contamination can be detected and a solution sought before the problem becomes serious.

Iron is present in all rocks and, thus, is a constituent of nearly all natural water. Iron concentration in the ground-water samples in the area of investigation ranged from 0.00 to 8.2 mg/1 and averaged 0.97 mg/1. The range in the surface-water samples was from 0.01 to 6.8 mg/1; the average was 0.57. A concentration of about 0.3 mg/1 or more in the water will stain enamel, porcelain, and clothing. Iron concentration of more than about 0.5 mg/1 gives water an unpleasant taste, but it causes no harmful physiological effects. The U.S. Public Health Service (1962) has recommended that the iron concentration in drinking water not exceed 0.3. mg/1.

GROUND-WATER HYDROLOGY AND GEOLOGY

A29

The presence of "iron bacteria" in wells and watertransmission lines creates a special problem. Iron bacteria are not true bacteria but are living organisms often present in natural water. They depend' upon iron for existence and thrive in slightly acid water containing 2 mg/1 or more iron. Crenothrix is probably the most common of the several iron bacteria known. Metallic and nonmetallic materials that carry water containing iron bacteria become coated by nodules of ferric hydroxide or by a slimy scum impregnated with ferric hydroxide. The water may turn red, and its rate of flow may be affected by the activity of these organisms. They cause one of the major water-treatment problems in the report area but can be controlled by certain methods. One of the most effective methods combines the use of chlorina,tion to kill the organisms and the addition of a polyphosphate compound to keep the iron in solution.
Manganese- (Mn)
The concentration of manganese in water is generally less than that of iron; however, the two constituents affect water similarly. Of the 30 ground-water samples analyzed, 23 contained a measurable concentration of manganese, which ranged from 0.01 to 0.45 mg/1 and averaged 0.17 mg/1. The manganese concentration in 19 samples equaled or exceeded the U.S. Public Health
Service (1962.) recommended limit of 0.05 mg/1. Manganese concentrations in the surface-water samples ranged from 0.00 to 0.30 mg/1 and averaged 0.09 mg/1.

Calcium is one of the major, constituents in natural water in a limestone terrane, such as the lower Great Miami River valley. Concentrations of calcium in the ground-water samples analyzed ranged from 73 to 210 mg/1 and averaged 97 mg/1. The corresponding, range for the surface-water samples was 47-95 mg/1, and averaged 78 mg/1. Calcium and magnesium are the principal causes of water hardness; their effects are discussed under the heading "Hardness."

Magnesium (Mg)

Dolomitic rock or unconsolidated materials derived

from it are the principal source of magnesium. Magne-

sium concentrations in analyzed ground-water samples

from the study area ranged from 20 to 82 mg/1 and

averaged 31 mg/1; concentrations .in the surface-water

samples ranged from 14 to 33 mg/1 and averaged 26

mg/1.

.

Sodium (No) and potassium (K)

.

...

The alkali metals sodium and potassium are discussed

together, as their sources and their effects on water are

similar. Sodium is generally the more abundant of the

two and is more easily dissolved from the source rock.

In the ground-water samples the concentration of sodium ranged from 2.5 to 31 mg/1 and averaged 12.3 mg/1, and that of potassium ranged from 0.9 to 3.6 mg/1 and averaged 1.9 mg/1. In the surface-water samples, the concentration of sodium ranged from 7 to 64 mg/1 and averaged 33 mg/1, and that of .potassium ranged from 2.2 to 5.2 mg/1 and averaged 3.8 mg/1. Although relatively low, these concentrations of the alkalies are sufficient to cause undersirable effects in some uses; such as in high-pressure boilers.

Bicarbonate (HCO3)
Water which contains carbon dioxide (C02 ) dissolves the carbonates of calcium and magnesium from rock, and in this reaction the bicarbonate (HC03 ) ion is formed. In a carbonate-rich terrane, bicarbonate is one of the major constituents of natural water. Concentrations in the ground-water samples analyzed ranged from 268 to 500 mg/1 and averaged 344 mg/1. In the surface-water samples, concentrations were 146-352 mg/1 and averaged 242 mg/1. In boilers and hot-water facilities, bicarbonate decomposes at high temperatures to yield carbon dioxide,. which is corrosive.

Sulfate (SO4 )

.

Sulfate in the natural waters of this area is largely

dissolved from gypsum, a highly soluble mineral which

occurs in the limestones and dolomites of western Ohio.

Concentrations of sulphate in the ground-water samples

analyzed ranged from 24 to 424 mg/1 and averaged 80

mg/1; in the surface-water samples (table 9) concen-

trations ranged from 47 to 188 ing/1 and averaged 108

mg/1. For the water year ending in 1964, the sulfate

content in the Great Miami River at Elizabethtown

(table 10) ranged from 33 to 190 mg/1. Sulfate, which

causes much of the noncarbonate hardness of water,

combines with calcium to form hard scale in boilers and

other heat-exchange equipment. The U.S. Public Health

Service (1962) has recommended that the sulfate con-

tent of drinking water not exceed 250 mg/1.

The occurence of sulfate in waters of the Great Miami

River valley deserves further study. Average sulfate

concentration in. the surface-water samples is higher

than that in the ground-water samples, and this suggests

that some of the. sulfate may be the result of waste

products. The sulfate concentration in collector 1 of the

Southwestern Ohio Water Co. (well 77 of present re-

port) has progressively increased for 13 years, probably

because of induced stream infiltration. Water in three

wells (wells 22, 23, 24) at the Armco East Works con-

tains abnormally high concentrations of sulfate from

142 to 424 mg/1. Whether the high concentrations are

the result of contamination from industrial wastes or

of the abundance of clay and silt in this hydrogeologic

environment (environment III) .is not yet known.

A30

GROUND WATER IN THE LOWER GREAT MIAMI RIVER VALLEY, OHIO

Chloride (Cl)

.

Chloride is a minor constituent of ground water in

the lower Great Miami River valley. Concentrations in

the ground-water samples analyzed ranged from 5.5 to

48 mg/1 and averaged 19 mg/1. Chloride concentrations

in the surface-water samples ranged from 14 to 78 mg/1

and averaged 44 mg/1. The high concentrations of

chloride in the surface water sampled during periods

of low flow (table 9) probably reflect contamination.

All the samples both ground water and surface water,

contained less chloride than the 250 mg/1 limit recom-

mended by the U.S. Public Health Service (1962) for

drinking water.

Fluoride (F)
Minute quantities of fluoride are present in most water from limestone terranes. In the analyses of the groundwater samples, the fluoride concentration ranged from 0.0 to 0.5 mg/1 and averaged 0.013 mg/1. The range in the surface-water samples is from 0.2 to 0.9 mg/1, and the average, 0.46 mg/1. Evidence indicates that fluoride concentrations of about 0.6 to 1.7 mg/1 reduce the incidence of tooth decay but that concentrations greater than 1.7 mg/1, although giving protection from decay, can cause mottling of teeth. The recommended control limits of the U.S. Public Health Service for fluoride (1962, p. 8) are based on the annual average of maximum daily air temperatures. Thus for the study area, where the annual average maximum air temperature is between 63.9° and 70.6°F, the recommended range for fluoride is from 0.7 to 1.2 mg/1, with an optimum value of 0.9 mg/1.

Nitrogen cycle
Nitrogen occurs in ground water in the lower Great Miami River valley in three forms: Ammonia (NH.,), nitrite (NO2 ), and nitrate (NO3 ). Of the three forms, which represent stages in the nitrogen cycle, only nitrate occurs naturally in ground water. Organic wastes, however, often contain nitrogen in all three forms. The presence of ammonia and nitrite can thus be considered as evidence of pollution.
Under oxidizing conditions, nitrate is the end product of the nitrogen cycle. An analysis for nitrate, however,
may not necessarily represent all the nitrogen present in the sample; therefore, tables 8 and 9 also show ammonia, nitrite, and potential nitrate.4
Concentration of nitrate in the ground-water samples (table 8) ranged from zero in six samples to 18 mg/1 and averaged 3 mg/1. Most nitrate concentrations in excess of 5 mg/1 are probably the result of contamina-

4 Potential nitrate is the sum of ammonia nitrogen (NH4), nitrite (NOa), and nitrate'(NOs), all reported as NOs. To convert milligrams per liter NH4 to milligrams .per liter NOs, multiply by 3.436. To convert mg/1 NOa to mg/1 NOs, multiply by 1.348.

tion. All these concentrations are well under the limit of 45 mg/1 for drinking water set by the U.S. Public Health Service (1962). In the selected surface-water samples the nitrate ranged from 3.9 to 19 mg/1 and averaged 10.5 mg/1.
Potential nitrate in the 19 ground-water samples ranged from zero in 5 samples to 43 mg/1 and averaged 3.8 mg/1. The value of 43 mg/1 for well 43 was omitted from the average as not representative. In the eight surface-water samples, potential nitrate ranged from 15.9 to 22.4 mg/1 and averaged 18.9 mg/1.
Nineteen of the 31 ground-water samples listed in table 8, and 8 of the 9 surface-water samples listed in table 9 were anlyzed for ammonia and nitrite. Six of the 19 ground-water samples contained ammonia, which ranged in concentration from O.i to 18 mg/1 and aver-, aged 0.4 mg/1.5 Five of the 19 samples contained nitrite, and each of these had 0.05 mg/1. Ammonia ranged from 0.1 to 4.8 mg/1 and averaged 2.2 mg/1 in the surfacewater samples. In these samples nitrite ranged from 0.15 to 0.90 mg/1 and averaged 0.43 mg/1. These concentrations suggest that the river is generally contaminated in varying degrees by organic wastes. The presence of small amounts of ammonia and nitrite in six of the ground-water samples suggests that the wells from which the samples were collected had been recharged with contaminated water, probably induced from the Great Miami River.
The potential nitrate of the 19'ground-water samples (excluding that from well 43) analyzed for the complete nitrogen cycle (table 8) ranged from 0 to 18 mg/1 and averaged 4 mg/1. In the surface-water samples (table 9) the potential nitrate ranged from 15.9 to 22.4 mg/1 and averaged 19 mg/1.
Phosphorus as PO4
Phosphates in surface or ground waters are derived from natural leaching of phosphatic rocks, from agricultural drainage, and from industrial and domestic wastes. With the greatly increased use of synthetic detergents, of which phosphates are a major constituent,
phosphate concentrations in waters (particularly in surface waters) have shown significant increases.
In the samples from the Great Miami River that were analyzed in this study, phosphate concentration ranged from 0.11 to 7.5 mg/1, with the higher values observed in the area between Miamisburg and Middletown.
Phenols as C0H.OH
The presence of phenolic material in naturally ocurring waters is the direct result of pollution. The effluents from coking plants, chemical plants, and oil refineries often contain large concentrations of phenols.
B The analysis of 18 mg/1 from well 43 was excluded from the average, as it is considered not representative.

GROUND-WATER HYDROLOGY AND GEOLOGY

A31

'Inasmuch *is phenols are unstable in the presence of

oxygen, they are hot persistent in a typical aerobic

stream and are generally broken down within a short

distance of their source. Thus, of the eight selected

samples from the Great Miami River analyzed for

phenols (table 9), only four contained measurable con-

centrations, which ranged from 0.009 to 0.020 mg/1. The

higher concentrations generally occur at low streamflow.

The fact that phenols were present in samples from

stations 1 and 3 but not in samples from stations 2 and 4

suggests that the stations 1 and 3 are fairly close to

sources of contamination. The relative lack of dissolved

oxygen at station 1 may contribute to the presence of

phenols there.

V

Of the 13 ground-water samples analyzed for phenols,

eight continued measurable concentrations, which

ranged from 0.001 to 0.011 mg/1. The occurrence of

phenols in ground water in the lower Great Miami River

valley is probably the result of induced infiltration of

contaminated water from the river. All the wells con-

taining phenols are in areas where induced infiltration

is thought to occur.

.

Even very low concentrations of phenols in water can

cause a disagreeable taste, and water containing phenols

in sufficient concentrations to be harmful is unpalatable.

The U.S. Public Health Service (1962) recommended

a limit of 6.001 mg/1 for phenols. Phenols from public

supply wells would probably break down when the

water is aerated; chlorination, however, stabilizes

phenols.

Synthetic detergents
One of the principal waste products of synthetic detergents has been anionic alkyl-benezene sulfonate, more commonly termed "ABS." This waste product is resistant to breakdown by both chemical and biological processes and is therefore persistent in streams. Where the concentration is high, foaming of stream water is plainly visible. All the .selected water samples, from the Great Miami River that were analyzed for ABS (table 9) showed concentration ranging from 0.1 to 1.2 mg/1. Of the 19 ground-water samples analyzed, however, only one from the O. H. Hutchings Station of the Dayton Power & Light Co. showed a concentration of 0.1 mg/1. The U.S. Public Health Service (1962) has recommended that drinking water contain no more than 0.5 mg/1 of AB'S. Although the Great Miami River always contains some ABS, this substance has not significantly contaminated ground water in the study area. ABS contamination has been disappearing from stream waters as the detergent industry has changed over to making LAS (linear alykl sulfonate), or "soft" (degradable), detergents.

Dissolved solids (residue at 180°C)
The dissolved-solids content in water is determined in laboratories of the U.S. Geological Survey by a process of evaporating a suitable volume of the sample to 'near dryness on a steam bath and then drying the residue in ah oven for 1 hour at 180°C (Hem, 1959, p. 49-50). Concentrations of dissolved solids in'grouhdwater samples from the study area ranged from 310 to 1,110 mg/1 and averaged 435 mg/1. Total dissolved soliiis in the selected surface-waiter samples ranged from 245 to 590 mg/1 and averaged 436 mg/1. Water having more than 1,000 mg/1 of dissolved solids is generally considered to be unsatisfactory for most purposes. The recommended maximum for dissolved solids in drinking water is 500 mg/1 (U.S. Public Health Service, 1962). Some specialized industrial applications' require a much lower concentration.
The extremely high dissolved solids content of 1,110 mg/1 in well 23, at the Armco East Works, is problematical. (The high concentration of sulfate in this well is discussed on p. A29.) Inasmuch as this well is in hydrogeologic environment III, the abundance of dissolved solids may be the result of the water's contact with large amounts of clay. Another possibility is that much of the solids content in this well is the result of contamination from industrial wastes.
Hardness
Foi1 many years, hardness in water has been considered to be the water's soap-consuming property. Soap-consuming water contains cations, chiefly calcium and magnesium, that form insoluble compounds with soap. This traditional concept is not entirely satisfactory, .however, because a great many other constituents also contribute to hardness and react with soap. In analyses by the U.S. Geological Survey a standard procedure has been adopted (Hem, 1959, p. 146). Hardness is reported under two classifications: calcium-magnesium and rioncarbonate. These are approximately equivalent to the traditional terms "temporary hardness" and "permanent hardness." Hardness attributable to calcium and magnesium is reported as an equivalent quantity of calcium carboiiate (CaCO8 ).
Calcium-magnesium hardness of the ground-water samples collected in the area of investigation ranged from 285 to 862 mg/1 and averaged 368 mg/1; noncarbonate hardness of the same samples. ranged from 29 to 451 mg/1 and averaged 88 mg/1. For the surfacewater samples, the calcium-magnesium hardness ranged from 175 to 361 mg/1 and averaged 301 mg/1, and the noncarbonate hardness, from 55 to 166 nig/1 and averaged 102 mg/1.
Ground water in the study area would be considered hard by almost any standard. Treatment is necessary

A32

for boiler use and is desirable for most other uses. The widespread use of detergents, however, has in many localities eliminated the need for softening the water used for laundering. The lime-soda method of treatment is used by the Hamilton water system to reduce the total hardness to about 100 mg/1. Most other public water-supply systems in the area do not soften their water, .and most of the small installations that do soften water use the ion-exchange or zeolite method, whereby the calcium and magnesium ions are exchanged for sodium ions.

Specific conductance

.

The conductance of a solution (its ability to con-

duct an electrical current) generally is directly related

to its dissolved-solids content. Conductance is the re-

ciprocal of resistance and is measured in'mhos, the re-

ciprocal of ohms. As the conductance of all natural wa-

ter is well below 1 mho, it is measured in micromhos

(mhos X lO"6 ). In water analyses by the U.S. Geologi-;

cal Survey, the specific conductance is reported as mi-

cromhos at 25°C (Hem, 1959, p. 38).

Although specific conductance is not always related to

the dissolved-solids content of water, it can be used to

estimate such content.- In the ground-water samples

from the lower Great Miami River valley, specific con-

ductance ranged from 550'to 1,510 micromhos and aver-

aged 708 micromhos. The specific conductance of water

from glacial-O'Utwash aquifers in the study area gen-

erally is about 1.5-2 times the dissolved-solids content.

Specific conductance of the surface-water samples

ranged from 382 to 958 micromhos and averaged 719

micromhos. In general, the higher specific conductances

occur during periods of low flow.

PH ' . '

' ''

'

'

The pH value (the negative logarithm of the hydro-

gen-ion concentration) is a measure of the acidity or

alkalinity of a solution. A pH value of 7.0 denotes a

neutral solution; a value less than 7.0, an acid solution;

and one greater than 7.0, an alkaline solution. The pH

of ground-water samples from the area of investigation

ranged from 7.0 to 7.7, values which reflect generally alkaline conditions. The pH of the selected surface-

water samples ranged from 6.8 to 7.8.

Color
Color refers to the appearance of water that is free from suspended solids. It is determined from the comparison of the water sample with the U.S. Geological Survey's arbitrary standard which consists of a series of colored glass discs that have been calibrated to units of the platinum-cobalt scale of Hazen. Most color in natural water is due to the presence of organic matter. In the ground-water samples from the study area, color ranged from 0 to 12 color units and averaged 3 color units.

These values are insignificant for most uses of water and cannot be detected by the unaided : eye. For the surface-water samples, however, the color ranged from 1 to 40 color units and averaged about 12 color units.

Dissolved oxygen

'

Ground water generally does not contain dissolved

oxygen, but uncontaminated stream water invariable

contains as much as 10 mg/1 of oxygen dissolved from

the atmosphere. Under normal stream conditions, at

least 5 mg/1 of dissolved oxygen is necessary to sustain

a varied fish fauna in good-condition. Data on dissolved

oxygen in the eight selected samples given in table 9

ranged from 1.8 to 10.4 mg/1, and the percentage of

saturation ranged from 14 to 87 percent. The reach of

the Great Miami River between Miamisburg and Mid-

dletown has become so badly polluted that the dissolved-

oxygen content in this part of the stream is usually

deficient at low streamflow. South of Middletown, how-

ever, stream conditions appear to be more favorable.

CONCLUSIONS
The lower Great Miami River valley is favored with the most abundant reservoir of ground water in Ohio. Although this aquifer system has already been extensively developed, the supply should be adequate in both quantity and quality to meet all anticipated requirements for several decades.
The most favorable environments for development of large ground-water supplies are those where the sand and gravel aquifer is close enough to the Great Miami River, or to another major stream, that pumpage from wells is sustained by induced recharge from the stream. In these environments, individual wells are capable of yielding as much as 3,000 gpm. Even aquifers less than 150 feet thick or containing areally extensive clay layers can provide large ground-water supplies if wells are spaced, developed, and screened suitably.
The valley-train deposits along the entire reach of the Great Miami River in the study area are generally in
these favorable hydrogeologic environments. Also, in
the study area, areally extensive clay layers are present from Middletown north but are absent south of Middletown. The most favorable areas for the development of new ground-water supplies (pis. 1, 2) are as follows: The Trenton area, the reach of the Great Miami River valley from New Miami through Hamilton and that from Fairfield to New Baltimore, and the part of lower Whitewater River valley between. Harrison and the Ohio River.
Hydrogeologic environments less favorable for development of large ground-water supplies are those where induced stream recharge is not available or where the
