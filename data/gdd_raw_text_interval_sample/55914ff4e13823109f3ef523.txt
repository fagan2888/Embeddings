INTRODUCTION _Purpose_ These maps were compiled to support the land-use planning work of the Bureau of Land Management and to provide a systematic coal resource inventory of Federal coal lands in theMcCallum Known_.Rec_gver_abJ.e_CQal_ Resource _ __ Area (KRCRA) in response to the land-use planning requirements of the Federal Coal Leasing Amendments Act of 1976. Published and unpublished non-proprietary data sources were used for this study. No new drilling or field mapping was done to supplement this study. No confidential or proprietary data were used.
Location __!h*LEagle_Hil_l__Zb-jnin.ute_qu_adrajrmle is_ located_in Ihejiortheast_p_art___ of Jackson County, Colorado. The extreme northeast corner of the quadrangle lies in Larimer County. The town of Walden, the county seat of Jackson County, is 2 miles (3.2 km) southwest of the quadrangle and the town of Cowdrey is 3.5 miles (5.6 km) west of the quadra^ngle^ T]ie Colorado-l^pjTnnq stateJj'ne is 8.5_miles (13_._7 km) north of the quadrangle.
Accessibility Except for the northeast corner, the quadrangle is accessible by numerous light-duty gravel and unimproved dirt roads. The rugged Medicine Bow Range crosses the northeast part of the quadrangle. This area is._lnacessible_tft_ vehicular traffic but a foot trai 1 foilows .northeastward uj^ Coon C_reek_canygn. The Canadian Rrver flpwj5^crqs_s_the_southjcentral part of the__guadrangle_and and roads cross^the river at several places. The nearest railhead is at Walden which is on a branch line of the Union Pacific Railroad which connects to Cheyenne, Wyoming. The Walden-Jackson County Airport is 1 mile (1.6 km) west of the southwest corner of the quadrangle.

Physiography The Eagle Hill quadrangle lies on the east side of a broad intermontane topographic basin called North Park. The basin is almost entirely surrounded by mountains including the Park Range to the west and the Medicine Bow Range on the east. Except for the mountainous northeast corner, the quadrangle lies in the lowland area of the basin which consists of rolling hills and shallow creeks and dry washes. The highest peak in the northeast corner of the quadrangle is 10,639 ft (3,243 m) above sea level. The low point is approximately 7,930 ft (2,417 m) above sea level where the Canadian River leaves the west side of the quadrangle. The relief is approximately 2,709 ft (826 m). The Medicine Bow Range rises sharply in the northeast part of the quadrangle. The mountains are steep and the canyons are narrow. An area covered by sand called North Sand Hills occurs on the north central side of the quadrangle. The surface drainage is toward the Canadian River which meanders westward across a broad flood plain through the central part of the quadrangle. The river flows northwestward from the quadrangle to its confluence with the North Platte River at the north end of the basin.
Climate
The Eagle Hill quadrangle has a mid-latitude steppe climate and semi-arid conditions prevail in the area. The normal annual precipitation for the quadrangle ranges from about 14 inches (36 cm) on the southwest corner to 30 inches (76 cm) on the high mountainous northeast corner (U.S. Department of Commerce, (1964)).
The nearest weather data recording station is at Walden where a record high temperature of 91° F (33° C) and a record low temperature of - 49° F (- 45° C) were recorded (Colorado State Climatology Office, personal communication) The mean annual temperature at Walden is 36.5° F (2.5° C). Except in the high

mountainous area in the northeast corner, the temperatures in the Eagle Hill quadrangle are expected to be in the range as those recorded at Walden. The temperatures in the higher mountainous area will be lower than at Walden which is at an elevation of about 8,100 ft (2,469 m).
Land Status The Eagle Hill quadrangle lies in the northeast part of the McCallum known Recoverable Coal Resource Area (KRCRA). The KRCRA covers approximately 11,800 acres (4,775 ha) of the quadrangle. The areas of non-Federal land and the KRCRA boundary are shown on plate 2. There were no existing Federal coal leases or preference right applications in this quadrangle at the date of the land check for this report as shown on plate 2. Approximately 42 percent of the quadrangle area is non-Federal land and 58 percent is Federal coal ownership land. Coal is known to be present in only part of the Federally-owned coal land.
Previous Work Beekly (1915) made a geological study of North Park and published a report which included a description of the coal occurrences. Guidebooks by the Wyoming Geological Association and the Rocky Mountain Association of Geologists contain papers on the geology of North Park (Severy and Thompson, 1953; Henkes, 1957; Montagne and Barnes, 1957). Hail (1965, 1968) published studies of the area! geology of the west side of North Park and Middle Park basins, Jackson and Grand Counties, Colorado. Madden (1976) studied the coal geology of the McCallum coal field and completed two unpublished reports describing the coal occurrence and coal-bed correlations. Madden and others (1977, 1978) reported on the coal geology of the entire North Park basin. Exploratory drilling in the McCallum coal field was reported by Madden (1977b). Miller (1934) described the north and south McCallum anticlines. Kinney (1970a, .1970b, 1971), Kinney and Hail (1970a, 1970b), and Kinney and others (1970) mapped the geology of the eastern part of North Park. Tweto (1976) compiled the geology of the Craig 1° x 2° quadrangle.

GENERAL GEOLOGY
Stratigraphy The oldest rocks exposed in the Eagle Hill quadrangle are the granitic rocks of Precambrian-X age in the core of the Medicine Bow Range which _ crosses the northeast part of the quadrangle. These rocks are composed of quartz diorite and are in part migmatitic and gneissic (Tweto, 1976). Along the foothill area of the Medicine Bow Range, successively younger rocks crop out in northwest-trending bands parallel to the mountain front. These rocks include the formation shown in table 1. The Coalmont Formation of Pal eocene and Eocene age includes the important coal beds in the quadrangle. In the northeast part of North Park, the Coalmont Formation has been divided into two informal merribe^s_:_ _Th_e_arkqsjc_ member at the base, and the volcanic member above (Kinney and others, 1970). Only part of the arkosic member is preserved in the Eagle Hill quadrangle. The volcanic member and part of the arkosic member have been removed by erosion. The arkosic member is composed of fine-grained, tan, micaceous sandstone; gray, tuffaceous siltstone; coarse, brown, crossbedded, lenticular, conglomeratic lenses; brown, carbonaceous claystone or mudstone and shale; and coal (Kinney and others, 1970). Estimates of the maximum aggregate thickness of the Coalmont Formation in North Park area range from 9,000 + ft (2,743 m) (Steven, 1960) to 12,000 ft (3,658 m) (Hail, 1968). Coal zone A is approximately 1,100 ft (335 m) above the base of the Coalmont Formation (Madden, 1976). This coal zone occurs near the central part of the Johnny Moore syncline in the Eagle Hill quadrangle and the maximum thickness of the Coalmont Formation in this quadrangle is therefore estimated to be somewhat greater than 1,100 ft (335 m).

Structure The most prominent structural feature in the Eagle Hill quadrangle is the Johnny Moore syncline which trends in a northwest direction across the south central part of the quadrangle (pi. 1). The syncline is generally asymmetrical with the steeper flank qn_the southwest s^ide where dips jrajige toi more than 70°. Dips on the northeast flank range up to 45°. Northeast of the synclinal axis, the beds rise toward the Medicine Bow Range high area with a small intervening fold (anticline and syncline) in the west central part of the quadrangle. Southwest of the synclinal axis, the rocks rise sharply toward the axis of the North McCallum anticline which crosses the southwest part of the quadrangle. An intermediate fold (anticline and syncline) lies between the North McCallum anticline and the Johnny Moore syncline in the south central side of the quadrangle. Several faults which occur in the south central side of the quadrangle (pi. 1) are mostly outside the coal -bearing area of the Sudduth coal bed. Most of these fault traces are inferred by dashed lines on plate 1 and it is assumed that the fault displacements are not large. Tweto (1976) shows four faults in the Eagle Hill quadrangle area. Two are in the northeast part of the map outside the coal -bearing area, and the other two cut the Coalmont Formation on the west central side of the quadrangle.
COAL GEOLOGY Sudduth Coal Bed The most important coal bed in the Eagle Hill quadrangle is the Sudduth bed which occurs approximately 100 ft (30-5 m) above the base of the Coalmont Formation. The Sudduth bed ranges from 3,^4 ft._("LO mj^to (JLJLm) jbJiicJejlrLjLJi^^g^jlrangle (pi. 1 and 3). The outcrop trace of the coal bed is near the contact between the Coalmont Formation and the Pierre Shale. The bed is fairly persistent and retains a thickness of over 4 ft (1.2 m)

for 10 miles (16 km) along the east side of the Johnny Moore syncline (Madden, 1976).
Coal Zone A Some lenticular shaly coal beds, called coal zone A, occur approximately 1,100 ft (335 m) above the base of the Coalmont Formation. Because only the
part_of the formation occurs in the quadrangle, younger coal Aeds^foiind in other areas are not present. Coal zone A occurs in the central part of the Johnny Moore syncline which lies in the southwest part of the quadrangle. Madden (1976) refers to the coal beds as shaly coal similar to^ the coal beds in the Capron zone in the Gould NW quadrangle. The Capron zone is approximately 1 ,850 ft (564 m) stratigraphically above the base of the Coalmont Formation. Only one measurement of a coal bed in coal zone A is available in the quadrangle, This was reported by Madden (1977, U.S. Geol . Survey, unpublished field notes) and the measurement was made at index number 16 on plate 1. At that location, the coaj _was_ 9._2_ft (2. 8 _m)__th ic k wi thjDart i ngs of ijT^^eddiedjr^cj^'tgMLllnfl-__ JL-Sjft (0.5 m).
Isolated Data Points In instances where isolated measurements of coal beds greater than 5 ft (1.5 m) thick are encountered, the standard citeria for construction of isopach, structure contour, mining ratio, and overburden isopach maps are not available. The lack of data concerning these beds limits the extent to which they can be reasonably projected in any direction and usually precludes correlation with other coal beds. For this reason, isolated data point maps are included on a separate sheet (in U.S. Geological Survey files) for non-isopachable coal beds. Resource data for these isolated data points were calculated for areas within % mile (0.4 km) of the points of measurement and are given in table 2 and are shown by asterisks on plate 2.

On the basis of the analyses shown in tables 3 and 4, the Sudduth coal at the sampling sites ranges from subbituminous B to high volatile C bituminous in rank (American Society for Testing and Materials, 1977). The average of the above analyses represents a rank of subbituminous A coal. It is assumed that the Sudduth coal bed in the Eagle Hill quadrangle is of similar rank.

MINING OPERATIONS Available information indicates that there are four abandoned coal mines or prospects in the Eagle Hill quadrangle (Madden, U.S.G.S., 1979, unpublished maps). These mines are considered as prospects because no information concerning their operation is available. The Colorado Division of Mines has no record of any production from the mines. Two of the prospects are in the Sudduth coal bed, one in coal zone A, and one is in a local bed which crops out in the southwest part of the quadrangle. Information concerning the prospects is summarized in table 5.

The nearest mines operating in 1979 were the Canadian strip mine and the Marr No. 1 strip mine (formerly the Kerr No. 1 strip mine) located in the Johnny Moore Mtn. quadrangle. These mines are approximately 4 miles i6_km)_ southeast of the Eagle Hill quadrangle and produce from the Sudduth coal bed. The coal bed thickness in those mines ranges from 34 to 60 ft_4lD_to_liLmL___ Total production from the Marr No. 1 strip mine through 1978 was 1,256,664 short tons (1,140,046 metric tons) (Colorado Division of Mines, personal communication). Total production from the Canadian strip mine through 1978 was 380,852 short tons (345,509 metric tons) (Colorado Division of Mines, personal communication).
COAL RESOURCES The principal_spurces _of_data_usM_iji^he_^ojis^trjKLtlorL_Qf_±h£.coal isppach. structure contour, and coal-data maps jwere Madden (1979, U,S,G.S. unpubllsJiecL field notes and maps) and Madden (1977b). Numerous oil and gas test wells have been drilled in the quadrangle and the available logs of these wells were inspected, but the logs were generally non-definitive for coal, or the wells were drilled in npn-coa]^ areas^ The coal isopach map was constructed using a point-data net derived from coal-thickness measurements of an individual bed obtained from surface exposures within the quadrangle boundary and within a 3-mile (4.8-km)-wide border extending beyond the quadrangle boundary. Measured coal thickness values were used directly in the point-data net. The principle of uniform variation in thickness between data points was used to establish the position of the isopach lines. A structure contour map was constructed using a point-data net derived from well logs and surface exposures. Elevations for the top of the contoured coal bed were based on surface altitudes and measured depths to the top of the coal bed and referenced to a mean sea Jeyel datum._____ _ _ __ ___

The overburden isopach map was based on a point-data net derived from stratigraphic-interval thicknesses measured from the ground surface to the top of the isopached coal bed. A secondary set of data-net points was generated by laying the structure contour map over a topographic contour map, and then calculating apparent overburden thickness values at the intersections of structure contour lines and surface topographic contour lines.
Coal thickness data was obtained from the coal isopach map (pi. 4) for resource calculations. The coal-bed acreage (measured by planimeter), multiplied by the average isopach thickness of the coal bed, multiplied by a conversion factor of 1,770 short tons of coal per acre-foot (13,018 metric tons of coal per hectare-meter) for subbituminous coal yields coal resources in short tons. Reserve Base and Reserve values for the Sudduth coal bed are shown on plate 7 and are rounded to the nearest tenth of a million short tons. The Reserve values are based on a subsurface mining recoverability factor of 50 percent where the coal bed dips 15° of less and a surface mining recoverability factor of 85 percent.
The following criteria for coal resource determinations are given in U.S. Geological Survey Bulletin 1450-B: "Measured.--Resources are computed from dimensions revealed in outcrops, trenches, mine workings, and drill holes. The points of observation and measurement are so closely spaced and the thickness and extent of coals are so well defined that the tonnage is judged to be accurate within 20 percent of true tonnage. Although the spacing of the points of observation necessary to demonstrate continuity of the coal differs from region to region according to the character of the coal beds, the points of observation are no greater than % mile (0.8 km) apart. Measured coal is projected to extend as a \ mile (0.4 km) wide belt from the outcrop or points of measurement.
14

"Indicated.--Resources are computed partly from specified measurements

and partly from projection of visible data for a reasonable distance on the

basis of geologic evidence. The points of observation are h (0.8 km) to

1^ miles (2.4 km) apart. Indicated coal is projected to extend as a % mile

(0.8 km) wide belt that lies more than ^ mile (0.4 km) from the outcrop or

points of observation or measurement. 11 Inferred.--Quantitative estimates are based largely on broad knowledge

of the geologic character of the bed or region and where few measurements of

bed thickness are available. The estimates are based primarily on an assumed

continuation from Demonstrated coal [a collective term for the sum of coal in

both Measured and Indicated Resources and Reserves] for which there is geologic

evidence. The points of observation are 1^ (2.4 km) to 6 miles (9.6 km) apart.

Inferred coal is projected to extend as a 2^-mile (3.6 km) wide belt that

lies more than 3/4 mile (1.2 km) from the outcrop or points of observation or

points of observation or measurement." (U.S.Bureau of Mines and U.S. Geolog-

ical Survey, 1976, p. B6 and B7).

Coal resource tonnages were calculated for measured, indicated, and

inferred categories in the unleased areas of Federal coal land where the coal

is 5 ft (1.5 m) or more thick and lies within 3,000 ft (914 m) of the surface.

The criteria cited above were used in calculating Reserve Base and Reserve

data in this report and differ from those stated in U.S. Geological Survey

Bulletin 1450-B, which calls for a maximum depth of 1,000 ft (305 m).

In this study, coal 5 ft (1.5 m) or more thick lying between the ground

surface and a depth of 200 ft (61 m) is considered amenable to surface mining

methods; coal 5 ft (1.5 m) or more thick lying between. 200 ft (61 m) and 3,000 ft (914 m) below ground level in beds having dips of 15° or less is

Reserve Base tonnages of Federal coal per section for the isopached coal bed are shown on plate 2 and total approximately 114.4 million short tons (103.8 million metric tons) for the unleased Federal coal lands within the quadrangle. Reserve Base tonnages (in short tons) in the various development potential categories for surface mining methods are shown in table 6, and those for subsurface mining methods are shown in table 7. The Reserve Base tonnage for in situ coal gasification methods for this quadrangle is approximately 95.1 million short tons (86.3 million metric tons) and is classified as having a low-development-potential. The coal resource tonnage for the non-isopached coal beds at isolated data points is 2.5 million short tons (2.3 million metric tons) (table 2).
AAA Engineering and Drafting, Inc. has not made any determination of economic recovery for any of the coal beds described in this report.
COAL DEVELOPMENT POTENTIAL Coal development potential areas are drawn (pi. 8 and 9) to coincide with boundaries of the smallest legal land subdivisions shown on plate 2. In sections or parts of sections where no land subdivisions have been surveyed by the BLM (U.S. Bureau of Land Management), approximate 40-acre (16-ha) parcels have been used to show the limits of high-, moderate-, or lowdevelopment-potential areas. The designation of a coal-development-potential classification is based on the occurrence of the highest rated coal-bearing area that may occur within any fractional part of a 40-acre (16-ha) BLM land-grid area, lot, or tract of unleased Federal coal land. For example, a certain 40-acre (16-ha)
17

parcel is totally underlain by a coal bed of moderate-development potential.

If a small corner of the same 40-acre (16-ha) area is also underlain by

another coal bed of high-development potential^the^entire 40-acre (16-ha)

is given a high-development-potential rating even though most of the area

is rated "moderate".

Areas where the coal beds 5 ft (1.5 m) or more in thickness are overlain

by 200 ft (61 m) or less of overburden are considered to have a surface mining

potential on the basis of the mining ratio (cubic yards of overburden per ton

of recoverable coal). The following formula is used to calculate mining ratios

t 0 (0.911) MR =
t c (rf)

Where MR = mining ratio (cubic yards of overburden per ton of recoverable

coal).

t Q = thickness of overburden (in feet)

t c = thickness of coal (in feet)

rf = recovery factor

0.911 = factor for subbituminous coal To convert mining ratio to cubic meters of overburden per metric ton of

recoverable coal, multiply MR by 0.8428.

Areas of high-, moderate-, and low-development-potential for surface

mining methods are here defined as areas underlain by coal beds having re-

spective mining-ratio values of 0 to 10, 10 to 15, and greater than 15.

These mining-ratio values for each development-potential category are based

on economic and technological criteria and were provided by the U.S. Geological

Survey (1979, unpublished data).

The coal development potential using surface mining methods is shown on plate 8. Approximately 9 percent of the unleased Federal land area in this quadrangle is classified as having a high-development-potential and 0.2 percent a low-development-potential using surface mining methods. The^ remaining Federal land in the quadrangle is classified as having an unknown surface mining development potential or no development potential. Areas of unknown surface mining development potential are those not known to contain coal beds 5 ft. (1.5 m) or more thick that are within 200 ft (61.0 m) of the surfaces; however, coal beds 5 ft. (1.5m) or more thick could be present in the^ajrea^_Labels_____ where it is known that no coal beds occur within 200 ft (16.Q_ml_jgf_th^jjrfac have no surface-mining potential.
The tonnage or Reserves recoverable by surface mining methods are calculated on a recoverability factor of 85 percent (specified by the U.S. Geological Survey, unpublished date, 1979) of the Reserve Base tonnage. Reserves have not been calculated for the nonisopached coal beds at isolated data points because the development potential for those beds is unknown.
Development Potential Using Subsurface Mining Methods and In Situ Coal Gasification
The coal development potential for areas in which subsurface mining of coal is possible is shown on plate 9. In this quadrangle, areas where coal beds dip 15° or less, are 5 ft (1.5 m) or more thick and are overlain by 200 to 1,000 ft (61 to 305 m) of overburden are considered to have a high-development-potential for conventional subsurface mining methods. Approximately 1.5 percent of the unleased Federal land in this quadrangle has a "high" classification. Areas where^ suchij)eds_are_oyerVain by1 ^000-2,000^ ft __ (305-610 m) and 2,000-3,000 ft (610-914 m) of overburden are rated asjiavlng moderate- ajid_Lo_w-development-potentials, respectively. Approximately 3
19

percent of the unleased Federal land in the quadrangle has a "moderate" coal-

development-potential, and 3.4 percent has a "low" coal-development-potential

for conventional subsurface mining methods. Areas that contain no known coal

in beds 5 ft (1.5m) or more thick but do contain coal-bearing units at depths

between 200 to 3,000 ft (61-914 m) are classified as areas of unknown coal

development potential. Areas where it is known that no coal beds occur

or where coal beds are present at depths greater than 3,000 ft (914 m) have

no coal-development potential.

Reserve Base tonnages have been calculated for all areas of unleased

Federal land where the coal beds are known to be 5 ft (1.5 m) or more thick.

_Reserves are based on a recoverability factor of 50 percent (specified by the

U.S. Geological Survey, unpublished data, 1979) and have been calculated for

only that part of the Reserve Base considered to be suitable for conventional

subsurface mining methods.

Areas where the dip of the beds is greater than 15° are assumed to be

suitable for in situ coal gasification. Approximately 13 percent of the

unleased Federal land in the quadrangle is in this category and is classified

as having a "low" coal-development-potential.

The recoverability of resources from coal beds with dips greater than

'15° is unknown; therefore, coal Reserves have not been calculated for those

beds, but the Reserve Base tonnages have been determined and are shown on

plate 7 and in table 7. The total Reserve Base tonnages per Federal section

are shown on plate 2.

Reserves have not been calculated for the nonisopached coal beds at

isolated data points. The areas controlled by those points have been

assigned an unknown development potential. No distinction has been made

between surface and subsurface mining resources in the areas controlled by

isolated data points.
