INCLUDING MANY ORIGINAL DETERMINATIONS OF UNDERGROUND TEMPERATURE.
By N. H. DAETON.
INTRODUCTION.
The purpose of this report is to present all available published data bearing on the rate of increase of underground temperature with increasing depth in the United States, together with several hundred original observations by myself and my associates. A canvass of the governmental, State, and serial publications has yielded many records of temperature of flowing wells and also a few observations made with thermometers in borings and deep mines. Additional data on temperature of flows have been given by correspondents. Some of the data, especially those relating to flows from wells, may not be reliable, and as a rule these could not be discriminated. Many records are omitted because no facts are available as to the source of flow.
During extended investigations of the geology of underground waters in many parts of the United States I and my assistants have had opportunity to observe the temperature of flows and to sink thermometers in deep borings. One very important contribution has come from an associate, J. E. Todd, who recorded the temperature of flows from a large number of wells in central-eastern South Dakota.
Mr. C. E. Van Orstrand, of the U. S. Geological Survey, has taken observations in various exceptionally deep wells in Pennsylvania, West Virginia, Oklahoma, and Texas, with very accurate apparatus, but only a few of the data are published.
The principal feature brought out by the data here presented is the fact that the rate of increase in underground temperature with increase in depth varies widely from place to place, though probably subject to certain regional relations. There is also a local and possibly a general variation in rate at different depths, but few of the observations have afforded data on this matter. The fact that there are regional variations has been recognized for half a century and was brought out in considerable detail in Prestwich's compilation of data

up to 1886 1 and his later publication in 1S95.2 This observer and others later have grouped earth temperatures and attempted to show their relation to rocks and minerals of various kinds,3 petroleum,4 flowing water, etc. There are undoubtedly in the earth many factors that may influence the rate of temperature increase, such as variation in conductivity of rocks, underground tension, mineralization, volcanic influences, and movement of underground waters. Variation in radioactivity has been suggested as a factor, and the influence of bodies of cold water, such as Lake Superior, and the former presence of glacial ice are thought to be causes of local diminution of earth temperature. Positive evidence is lacking as to all these matters, however, and we must await the results of extended special investigations before the weight of the several factors can be evaluated.
In nearly all my calculations of the rate of increase in temperature with increase in depth mean annual air temperatures were used as a standard. These were obtained from publications of the Weather Bureau, United States Department of Agriculture, and nearly all of them represented averages up to and including 1916.5 In places for which no observations are on record temperatures were deduced from means of near-by stations, with due consideration of .difference in latitude and altitude. It is realized that these means of air temperature may differ from the ground temperature a few yards below the surface to the amount of 2° or more, but they were the only data available for comparison. 6 In a few places the temperatures at shallow depths were recorded, and the rate of increase could also be calculated from them.
The thermometers used by me and my assistants and supplied to certain correspondents were maximum self-registering instruments made to order by Henry Green, of Brooklyn, N. Y. The style is similar to that used by William Hallock, but certain modifications were found desirable. The modified form has been termed the Darton thermometer, but the difference hardly merits the title. The main features are shown in figure 1. A 10-inch outer tube of heavy glass, sealed, carries an 8-inch thermometer held by plugs of cork, C; S, stricture; r, rounded end of mercury column. The calibra-

tion is in degrees Fahrenheit and is readable to half

a degree with certainty.

Most of the instruments were verified at the

Bureau of Standards. As a rule they were used

singly, but in certain places two instruments were

used either simultaneously or in succession. They

are intended to be sunk bulb end up, for the mer-

cury in the bulb end does not easily jar past "the

stricture. In warm weather care is taken to chill

the instrument before lowering. . It is wrapped in

flannel, placed in a 14-inch piece of 1-inch lead

pipe, and usually lowered by means of No. 18 wire,

with care to avoid jars.

...

Generally the instrument was left down the hole

overnight or at least four hours. In observing tem-

peratures of flowing water I and my assistants used

ordinary 6-inch thermometers readable to half de-

grees and tested as to accuracy.. Nothing is known

as to the kind of instruments used for most of the

observations given in published reports or fur-

nished by correspondents. They probably varied in

character. -

Throughout this report temperatures are given in

degrees Fahrenheit, depths in feet, and yield of

wells in gallons a minute. Although the geothermal

gradient should strictly be stated in units of tem-

perature per unit of depth, it is customary, in order

to get larger and more readily comparable' quanti-

ties, to use the reciprocal statement, units of depth

per unit of temperature. The figures are here given

in feet per degree Fahrenheit. A high gradient is

of course represented by a small number of feet per

degree, and vice versa.

ALABAMA.
TEMPERATURE OBSERVATIONS.
Many observations of the temperature of waters from flowing and other wells in Alabama have been recorded, most of them by the State geologist.1 Unfortunately, in the greater part of these observations the source of the water is not stated, and there is uncertainty as to the accuracy of the thermometers used. The following selected data are believed to be of sufficient value to be considered.

Temperatures of flows from wells that derive part or all of their water from unknown depths are reported as follows: Boguechitto, Dallas County, 460 'feet deep, 68°; Boligee, Green County, 468 feet, 66£°, and 420 feet, 66°; Montgomery, 550 feet, 68°, with some water from 480 feet.
SUMMARY.

Probably several of the wells represented in the , table have admixtures of water from different depths. The well at Union Springs, in Bulloch County, is pumped with an output of 150 gallons a minute, and as it is cased to a depth of 843 feet its water probably indicates the underground temperature with fair accuracy; the rate of increase indicated is 1° in 74 feet. The two deeper wells at Cahaba if cased to their bottoms indicate temperature increases of 1° in 57 and 55 feet, but tlie record of the shallower well at Bell's Hotel, with a rate of 1° in 45 feet, in some measure invalidates the data from the others. The 409 and 487 foot wel]s at Selma may have mixed flows. The exceptional temperature of 72° reported for

GEOTHERMAL DATA OF THE UNITED STATES;
tKe 470-foot well may be a mistake. The Eutaw wells show rates of increase of 1° in 27 to 66 feet. The Steeles Bluff well is cased to a depth of 360 feet. Its recorded rate of increase of 1° in 74 feet is probably reliable if the thermometer reading is correct. This rate is subject to a small plus or minus correction due to uncertainty as to the mean annual temperature. - The Hale County wells of which the depths to flowing water are recorded show considerable range in rate of increase, mostly 1° in 34 to 54 feet.; The wells at Mobile indicate rates of 1° in 67 and 71 feet. The temperature of the water from the Pittsboro and Millwood wells, 72°, is remarkably high for wells only 219 and 236"feet deep and indicates rates of 1° in 30 and 79 feet, respectively. These figures might be modified slightly, however, if the exact mean annual temperature were known. The same is true of the '200-foot well 4$ miles south of Eutaw, in Greene County. Hale County also shows some high rates of increase. The low rate of the 200-foot well at Linden, in Marengo County, is a notable exception in the region southwest of Tuscaloosa. The Epes 750-foot well, the Huntersfield well, and the Selma wells (except the 470-foot well) are others having lower rates than the many wells that show increases of 1° in 50 to 90 feet.
GEOLOGIC RELATIONS. '
All the wells given in the list are in the southern or Coastal Plain part of the State and penetrate sands, marls, and clays of Cretaceous and Tertiary age. These strata form a succession of sheets which dip southward at a low. angle and mostly thicken in that direction. They lie on a basement of older granite, schist, and other rocks, which is nearly reached by the deeper wells in the northern part of the Coastal Plain district, among them the deeper wells in Tuscaloosa County, the wells 500 to 550 feet deep in Greene County, the deeper wells in Pickens County, the 930-foot well 3 miles southeast of Epes, in Sumter County, and the 1,200-foot well at Linden, Marengo County. These wells appear to show a wide range in rate of increase of temperature, the rate in the well at Linden, the deepest well reported, being very low 1° in 143 feet, if the temperature of the flow is given correctly. The group of wells in Bullock, Russell, and Barbour counties, most of which draw from younger formations, show no special variations. The temperature recorded for the wells in Selma, which draw from the upper part of the Tuscaloosa formation, is about 68°, indicating a low rate of increase. The wells at Mobile draw from higher beds and show a rate of 1° in about 70 feet.

ARIZONA.

SOURCE OF INFORMATION.

Underground temperatures in Arizona have been determined by W. T. Lee, C. A. Fisher, and A. T. Schwennesen, of the United States Geological vSurvey. In 1904 Mr. Lee made for me a number of observations in wells and shafts at the Congress mine, near Phoenix, and in the Plateau region, and from 1913 to 1915 Mr. Schwennesen 1 obtained temperatures'in the San Simon Valley.

PHOENIX.
Several moderately deep borings were made in Salt River Valley near Phoenix, most of them sunk to develop water supplies from the deep desert-valley fillings. In January, 1904, Mr. Lee 2 carefully determined temperatures in these holes by sinking Darton thermometers with the results set forth below. The mean annual air temperature at Phoenix for 21 years, 69.4°, is used in the calculations of gradient.

The increase is 3^° from 150 to 375 feet in the well of the Consolidated Canal Co., though it is only half a degree from 150 to 349 feet in the well at the Murphy & McQueen ranch. Lee suggests that this difference may be due. to freer circulation of the underflow at the latter place.

GEOTHERMAL DATA OF THE UNITED STATES.

CONGRESS MINE.
The large Congress gold mine, south of Prescott, Ariz., which has been worked to a depth of 1,300 feet, was selected for a series of careful determinations of temperature. The tests were made in March, 1904, by W. T. Liee, in shafts No. 6 and No. 3, which had not been worked for several months. A week in advance of the tests holes from 5 to 9 feet deep were drilled at various depths into the walls of side drifts 30 to 142 feet from these shafts but out of the main currents of ventilation. The thermometers were lightly covered and allowed to remain in the holes from 10 to 24 hours. The shafts are steep inclines, No. 6 being at an angle of about 45° and No. 3 at about 21°, and as they extend downward the land above rises considerably. The depths given below are taken from a surface profile in which the elevations were determined barometrically by Mr. Lee.

a Based on mean annual temperature of 67.7°, the average for 1897 to 1904 at the mine. This is probably too high, as the mean at Wickenburg, about 1,000 feet lower in altitude, was 64.2° for 1916.

The rate of increase in shaft No. 6 is 1° in 78.7-feet between 560 and 1,158 feet. The rates in shaft No. 3 are 1 ° in 146 feet between 20j5 and 687 feet, 1° in 137 feet between 687 and 1,125 feet, 1° in 141 feet between 205 and l,125feet, and 1° in 21.3 feet between 1,125 and 1,285 feet. The rock is granite, mostly massive, but at the 1,285-foot level in shaft No. 3 the observation was made 8 feet below a 2-foot zone of crushed schistose material with slickensided surfaces indicating much movement. Probably this condition caused the much greater increase of temperature between 1,125 and 1,285 feet than in the intervals above and in shaft No. 6. Shaft No. 6 is all in massive granite down to the vein, which is cut at 1,158 feet. The temperature at 1,285 feet in shaft No. 3 was verified by a duplicate observation.

In the Yucca well the rate of increase was 1° in 55.5 feet between 455 and 1,004 feet, and in the Nelson well it was 1° in 69.1 feet between 200 and 1,043 feet. Both holes are in nearly horizontal limestone of Carboniferous age and perhaps had reached the underlying Cambrian shale. The Seligman well was tested at two levels, first at 700 feet and 14 months later at 1,216 feet, where the temperature was 6.3° cooler. At Seligman there ;is a mass of later Quaternary basalt several hundred feet thick which may retain some of its original heat and so cause the higher rate of increase near the surface. In another hole at this place 227 feet deep and entirely in the basalt the rate is still higher. Below the basalt the boring was in Carboniferous limestone in a shallow syncline.

SAN SIMON VALLEY.
San Simon Valley, in the southeast corner of Arizona, contains many flowing wells 200 to 1,230 feet deep, drawing their supply from the thick valley fill of sand and clay. Mr. Schwenn^sen made the following tests.

18 GEOTHERMAL DATA OF THE UNITED STATES.

SUMMARY.
The data for AUbrook, Hot Springs, Pine Bluff, Stamps, and Texarkana apparently are not valid, probably because the true source of the flow is not given. The temperatures in other wells appear to be consistent. These wells are in the southern quarter of the State and reach water-bearing strata in the great Tertiary sedimentary series of the Mississippi embayment.

GEOLOGIC RELATIONS.
The Gurdon well draws from the Nacatoch sand in the Upper Cretaceous; the Arkansas City well, the shallow well at Wilmar, and the Fordyce well, all with high rates of increase in temperature, draw from Eocene beds at the horizon of the Yegua ("Cockfield") formation, about 1,500 feet higher; the Monticello well and the 455-foot well at Wihnar, both with high rates of increase, draw from coarser deposits of Eocene age not far below the Yegua horizon.
CALIFORNIA.
SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA.
W, C. MendenhaU.,1 in studying the hydrology of southern California, determined the temperature of water flowing from many artesian and other wells and from several hot springs. The following list sets forth the principal data obtained in San Bernardino Valley:

( San Bormrdino average for 25 years.

The. distribution, depths, and geothermal gradients of most of these wells are shown in figure 2.
The data in the table present variations that are difficult to understand. Some of them are not reliable, because flows from higher horizons may have ingress to the well, and in a few wells the outflow is small, but these two conditions cause diminished temperatures. The materials penetrated by the borings are a thick series of Quaternary sand, gravel, and clay lying horizontal and constituting a wide desert plain. The conditions are favorable for rapid circulation of water, so that the mean annual air temperature 62.5° should be expected to extend some distance below the surface. On the edge of the basin and at Harlem Springs there are thermal springs, and in a local crumple of the beds passing through Bunker Hill warm waters come very near the surface. The areas of high temperature are probably due to seepage of warm spring waters along or near recent faults. Admixture with the shallow underflow causes the great diversity of temperatures shown.
The 642-foot boring 2 miles southeast of San Bernardino, whose water has a temperature of 112°, appears to have tapped a particularly warm spot, although shallower borings a short distance southwest show nearly the same rate of temperature increase. The water of the Urbita Springs has a temperature of 102° to 105°. Several wells near the Bunker Hill anticlinal ridge show temperatures of 85° to 105°, and the shallow wells of the Riverside Water Co. along the north bank of Santa Ana River show temperatures of 7.1° to 73°. Deeper wells, 320 to 656 feet deep, near Loma Linda show temperatures

of 70° to 75°, but the rate of increase is not.so high in these wells as in the other wells just mentioned.

Mendenhall* has recorded the temperatures in many wells in the Anaheim and Santa Ana districts of the eastern coastal-plain region of southern California, and, although most of them are too shallow to indicate the geothermal gradient, they present some interesting features. Most of the wells are from 80 to 200 feet deep, and the waters show unaccountable variations in temperature, mostly from 61° to 65° and a few to 70°. Of the few deeper wells covered by the

records one flowing well 397 feet deep in the San Joaquin district showed a temperature of 79°, which indicates a rate of increase of about 1° in 23 feet. Another well near by, 165 feet deep, with a temperature of 81°, indicates a still higher rate. The temperature of water from a 386-foot well was 67°, a 390-foot well 70°, a 264-foot well 71°, a 360-foot well 71°, a 336-foot well 71°, a 400-foot well 68°, two 450-foot wells 66°, and a 118-foot well 71°. Some of the wells showing the higher temperatures are in groups or districts, but others appear to be irregularly distributed.

In this region other wells from 113 to 300 feet deep show temperatures of 62°; wells 68 and 172 feet deep, 63°; 280 feet, 64°; 250 feet/65°; 60 and 160 feet, 66°; 147, 160, and 300 feet, 67°; 139, 160, 180, 250, and 255 feet, 68°; and 140 and 220 feet, 69°. These figures indicate great irregularity in the rate of increase at slight depths.

22 GEOTHERMAL DATA OF TH-E UNITED STATES.
SAN LUIS OBISPO.
A flow of sulphur water from a 928-foot well at San Luis Obispo has a temperature of 103°. As the mean annual air temperature at this place is 57.2°, this indicates a rate of increase of 1° in 20 feet.
SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY.
Mendenhall and Dole * have given records of many observations of temperatures of wells in San Joaquin Valley. Most of the wells are shallow,"but others are deep and flowing, so that their temperatures throw much light on the rate of increase. These wells are all in the filling of loam, clay, sand, and gravel, occupying a broad valley between mountain ranges of older rocks. These deposits are known to be more than 2,000 feet thick in places. It is believed that none of the wells here recorded have reached their base. The data which appear to be most useful are given in the following list:

The water in many shallow wells in San Joaquin Valley has temperatures ranging from 65° to 72°, or considerably higher than the mean air temperature.
INDIO BASIN.

Mendenhall x has given the temperatures of flow from many oi the artesian wells in the Indio Basin. They all draw from gravel and sand in the deep Quaternary valley fill, the bottom of which has not been reached by any of the borings.

The flows from most of these wells have remarkably low temperatures. Some are only a degree or two warmer than the mean annual air temperature of 73.9° (the average for 39 years- at India)-,, and several are colder. One well 400 feet deep in sec. 16'-, T. 7 S.,. R. 8 E., has water 8° warmer than that found in closely adjoining wells of similar depth. The 780-foot well in sec. 34 has. a flow with a temperature of 90°, indicating a rate of increase of 1° in 48 feet, and two wells, near by 220 and 250 feet deep have flows with a temperature of 91°, indicating rates of increase of 1° in 13 and 15 feet, respectively. About 3. and 4 miles to the south, along a prolongation of the same line, are wells, yielding large flows with temperatures of 92°,. 94°, and 90°. It is probable that these wells tap a supply from a fissure, possibly a fault, along which heated waters are rising from a deep-seated source. It is. stated that a 500,-foot hole was sunk in

GRASS VALLEY.
Lindgren 2 made observations of temperatures in the mines of gold-bearing quartz in the Grass Valley and Nevada City districts in 1894. Thermometers were left in holes with the following results: 30 feet below surface, 53|°; 1,513 feet below surface, 66°; 1,513 feet below surface (dry hole in quartz), 67£°; 1,553 feet below surface, 66°. These observations indicate a rate of increase of 1° in 122 feet at 1,553 feet and of 1° in 105 feet at 1,513 feet.

a Temperature about Alamosa observed by Trof. Carpenter. 6 Based on an approximate mean annual of 43° averaged from observations in adjoining regions.
It is suggested that the high rate about Swedes Corners is probably due to the presence of an old lava flow, a part of which crops out 1 mile west and 3 miles north from the Corners.

30 GEOTHERMAL DATA OF THE UNITED STATES.

The flow from a 405-foot well on Cotton Creek, in Saguache County, is reported to have a temperature of 58 °, but as the mean annual air temperature at that locality is not known the rate of increase can not be calculated.
LEADVILLE.
It is reported x that a 400-foot well in sec. 25 near Leadville yields a flow with a temperature of 58°. As the mean annual air temperature at Leadville is 35° (average for 18 years) this would indicate a rate of increase of about 1° in 17 feet.

TRINIDAD.

In June, 1905, W. T. Lee made temperature determinations at

various depths in a 2,500-foot boring at Trinidad. The hole was

found to be plugged at 770 feet, and a Darton thermometer left at

that depth for several hours recorded 69.6°. A test at 370 feet gave

67.8°. As the mean annual temperature of Trinidad is 51.3° (average

for 15 years) these readings indicate rates of increase of 1° in 42

feet and 22 feet, respectively. The. difference between the two read-

ings, however, indicates a rate of increase of 1° in 222 feet between

depths of 370 and 770 feet.

SUMMARY.

The rate of increase of temperature in wells in tla« Arkansas Valley varies considerably, but in most of them it is high. From Baxter to La Junta the average is near 1° in 34 feet and variations from the average are mostly less than 10 feet. The Pueblo wells show an average near 1° in 50 feet, but farther west the rate is higher. In San Luis Valley the rate is 1° in 33 to 42 feet so far as the few observations show. The Trinidad hole showed too much variation to be significant. The rate in the Denver wells was 1° in 33 to 56 feet, at Montrose 1° in 33£ feet, and at Akron 1° in 45 feet. The observation at the Loveland well is open to question as to the source of the flow.
GEOLOGIC RELATIONS.

Wells in the Arkansas Valley below the Pueblo draw from the Dakota and associated sandstones, which dip gently eastward. The well in T. 18 S., H. 6'9 W., also reaches the Dakota sandstone. The Florence wells penetrate much higher sandstones in a basin holding coal measures, and the Canon City holes are on the west rise of this basin. The San Luis Valley wells are in Quaternary valley filling. The Trinidad hole was in the Pierre shale at 770 feet. Wells in the Denver Basin penetrate the nearly horizontal younger Tertiary deposits. . At Montrose the Dakota sandstone was probably reached, and the Akron hole was in the Pierre shale. The precise relations at the LeadviUe well are not known, but the region contains limestone cut by igneous rocks and greatly mineralized.

32 GEOTHERMAL' DATA OF THE UNITED STATES.
FLORIDA.
Although many determinations of temperature of flows from artesian wells in Florida have been published, there are few reliable data to indicate the geothermal gradient. This is due largely to lack of information as to the depth from which the water is derrved and as to whether or not higher flows mingle with the main flow.

ST. AUGUSTINE.
In the large well at the Ponce de Leon Hotel, St. Augustine, the main flow, from 1,340 to 1,390 feet, has a temperature of 86 0,1 As the mean annual temperature of St. Augustine is 69.5° (65-year average), this would indicate a rate of increase of 1° in 81.2 feet, providing no water enters the casing above 1,340 feet. When the well was being bored the temperatures of water from the principal large flows brought rapidly to the surface in the sand pump from various depths were recorded as follows :2

34 GEOTHERMAL DATA OF THE UNITED STATES.
SUMMARY.
Apparently the most important data on temperature here presented are those from St. Augustine, Fort Myer, Mandarin, and Rockledge. Some of the others may be reliable, but there is a possibility that in many of the wells higher flows mingle with the main flow. The source of the flows at Melbourne and Micco is not known, and most of the other wells in Brevard County are shallow. The flows at Jacksonville are known to be mixed, for although the main flow is derived from a depth of 555 feet other flows come in, notably in the deeper wells, which tap a flow at a depth of 975 feet, below a body of clay. Temperatures of flows in the 984-foot city well, which is cased only to 494 feet, are stated 1 to be as follows: 524 to 727 ieet, 76° to 77|°; 865 to 970 feet, 78° to 79°; flow at mouth, 77*°. The large flow from the 496-foot well at Fort Myer probably affords a true indication of underground temperature, although it shows a smaller rate of increase than is indicated by the well a mile east of Fort Myer.
GEOLOGIC RELATIONS.
The wells in Florida penetrate sands, clays, and limestones of Tertiary age, which lie nearly horizontal and are uniform in character over wide areas. Those at St. Augustine, Jacksonville, and Mandarin penetrate deeply into Oligocene limestones of the Vicksburg group, which are overlain by clays and sands of later Tertiary age. These limestones were also reached by the holes in Brevard and Clay counties and at Fort Myer. The variations in geothermal gradient have no obvious connection with geologic features.
GEORGIA.
TEMPERATURES.
Local observers have furnished records of the temperature of flows from several wells in Georgia which afford a few data as to the geothermal gradient. Other facts regarding the wells are given by McCallie 2 and by Stephenson and Veatch. 3

SUMMARY.
The data given indicate considerable variation in the geothermal gradient in Georgia, but it is difficult to know which are reliable. The figures for the Claxton, Hawkinsville, and Offerman wells appear to be valid, and the source of flow in the wells at Albany and a well 12 miles west of Savannah, which show a low rate of increase, may be correctly reported. The Waycross water is probably cooled by air lift. The Georgia wells can not be grouped geographically by their rates of increase or by their depths.

GEOLOGIC RELATIONS. 1
The wells in the list are all in the Coastal Plain province, in which sheets of sand, gravel, and clay of Cretaceous and Tertiary age dip gently to the east and southeast. The older beds lie on a basement of pre-Cambrian crystalline rocks, which slopes to the southeast and is far beneath the surface along the coast and at the Florida State line. The Albany deeper wells draw from the Ripley formation, high in the Cretaceous. The water-bearing stratum at Hawkinsville and Bowens Mill is sand, probably at the top of the Cretaceous or the base of the Eocene. The Offerman, Claxton, and Waycross wells draw from beds in the Eocene at a considerably higher horizon, and
i For details regarding relations of wells see Stephenson, L. W., and Veatcb, J. O., op. cit.

,-36 GEOTHEEMAL DATA OF THE UNITED STATES.

the Savannah, Brunswick, and Valona wells may reach beds still higher. From these statements it will be seen that there is no apparent relation between the rates of increase in temperature and the water horizons.
IDAHO.
BOISE.
The water of the artesian wells at and near Boise is reported to have temperatures of 80° to 170°. As the depths of these wells are less than 500 feet, the higher temperatures, at least, indicate a very high geothermal gradient, which is due, doubtless, to local volcanic conditions.
SNAKE EIVEK VALLEY.

Russell 1 reports temperatures in a number of wells along the Oregon Short Line Railroad on the Snake River Plains as observed by Scott Turner. They all indicate high temperatures. The most notable are as follows:

Russell 2 has also given data of wells on the south side of Snake River valley in Owyjhee County. The temperatures are high, and as there are numerous hot springs in the region it is believed that the wells draw in part from deep-seated thermal waters rising in fissures. The wells all flow from 20 to 120 gallons a minute and are sunk to sands in the Payette formation, of lower Tertiary age.

These rates are based on an assumption that the mean annual temperature is 52° F., a figure approximated from observations at distant stations.
Russell also states that the water in a 240-foot well near Hot Springs, in Bruneau Valley, Owyhee County, had a temperature of 109° F. The well flows 7 gallons a minute and is near a hot spring of the same temperature. There are many shallow wells on these lava plains of Snake River which yield warm water, but as the region is one of relatively recent volcanic activity the lava flows are doubtless the source of the heat.

NEZ PERCE COUNTY.
In his report on Nez Perce County, Russell 1 gives a number of temperatures of deep wells and warm springs. A 220-foot well on the Dowd farm, 8 miles southeast of Lewiston, has a flow of 15 to 20 gallons a minute, which in December, 1900, John Adams found to have a temperature of ,58f°. A copious spring near by had a temperature of 54°. Several wells about 100 feet deep, not far away, had flows with temperatures of 66° to 68°, according to the same observer. The mean annual temperature of the locality is estimated by Russell as 48° to 49°. Russell believed that the water must come from a depth of 540 to 1,000 feet in these wells in order to account for the high rate of increase indicated, but as the region is underlain by recent basalt it appears to me more likely that this rock at a moderate depth is the source of the heat.
ILLINOIS.

TEMPERATURES.
About fifty records of temperatures in deep wells in various parts of Illinois were obtained, and although in many of the wells the flows are mixed, in others the depth of flow is known and the rate of increase is indicated. At Streator and St. John Darton thermometers were sunk to the bottom of the wells.

SUMMARY.

The most satisfactory observations of underground temperature in Illinois are those made at St. John and Streator, where thermometers were sunk to the bottoms of the holes. At St. John the instrument was left down 24 hours. When withdrawn it read 101°, indicating a rate of increase of 1° in 83.5 feet. The temperatures in wells in Rock Island County were accurately taken by Prof. Udden. The variation which some of them show is possibly due largely to mingling of flows. However, the observations were made just after vigorous drilling, and some heat of impact may be manifest. The wells at Peoria give results so closely accordant that presumably the flows are all from the bottom or near it. The Hennepin well, "cased nearly to the bottom," and the Knoxville, Chicago, Marissa, and Galesburg wells give close approximations of rate if the water is not cooled by pumping. The temperatures in the Cairo wells may not be accurately determined.
Flows from the deep well, at Aledo may be mixed, and if so the rate of 1° in 168 feet is not valid. The Oak Park flow is undoubtedly mixed. The high temperature of water from the 950-foot well at Pekin probably indicates a source at the bottom of the well, and the rate of 1° in, 42 feet is considerably higher than that of any other well in the State.
The rates of increase given in the list appear not to have any regional relations but vary from place to place. Galesburg and Knoxville, not far apart, apparently have rates of 1° in 106 feet and 66 feet, respectively. Pekin is not far south of Peoria, where the average rate is 1° in 60 feet.

GEOLOGIC RELATIONS.
The Illinois wells penetrate limestone, shale, #nd sandsfone of Carboniferous to Ordovician age, all lying nearly horizontal, without local disturbances of large amount and with no volcanic rocks. The Streator well is stated to be on a low anticline trending northwestward. The deep wells in the southern part of the State reach the oldest strata, most of them drawing from the St. Peter sandstone. At Peoria the shallower wells in the Niagara limestone show no material difference in rate of increase in temperature from the deeper ones, which draw from the St. Peter sandstone. A similar condition is presented by various wells of Rock Island County. The Cairo wells penetrate Cretaceous deposits to a depth of about 500 feet and then enter flint rock and sandstone of Mississippian age. If the flow£ are from about 500 feet, the base of the Cretaceous, the rate is 1° in about 110 feet.

SUMMARY.

The rate in Indiana probably is not indicated accurately by these

data except possibly by those for the Carroll County, Sandusky,

Terre Haute, and Michigan City wells, which give figures that appear

reasonably accordant.

IOWA.

TEMPERATURES.
A report of the State Geological Survey 1 and a report by Norton and others 2 give temperatures of flows from many deep wells in Iowa. Doubtless most of the figures are correct, but for most of the wells either the flows are known to be from various depths or no facts are given as to their source. Some of the wells are pumped, a condition which is unfavorable for accurate results, especially if the air lift is used. The 3,000-foot well at Des Monies is one in which many flows mingle and the water is pumped to the surface. Temperatures of flows from several of the deep wells at Davenport were taken for me by J. A. Udden in 1898, but unfortunately in most of the wells there are mingled flows. The well at Ames was tested by S. W. Beyer, 3 who lowered a Miller-Casella thermometer and took readings every 100 feet.

SUMMARY.
The data here given from the Iowa wells present considerable diversity in value. The Beyer determinations of temperature at 2,250 feet at Des Moines and at 2,100 feet at Ames are valuable records. They were taken with a Miller-Casella self-registering instrument at intervals of 250 feet in the Des Moines well and 100 feet at Ames. The wells were full of water and had not been disturbed for a month or more. The rates of increase in temperature, 1° in 109 feet and 127 feet, respectively, appear abnormally low and are considerably less than the rate in the 940-foot Nevada well, 9 miles east of Ames. As shown in the table there were some remarkable local variations at different depths. The rates indicated by many

IOWA.

43

records in the southeast corner of the State vary greatly. The deeper Ottumwa wells give 1° in 62£, 77|, 80, and 87 feet, and the 800-foot well at the Young Men's Christian Association Building indicates 1° in 53 feet or less. The Amana data appear to be not worth considering. Some of the Davenport data appear to be consistent and indicate a rate of 1° in 75 to 77 feet. The Keokuk, Fort Madison, and Burlington rates of 1° in 42 to 73 feet appear to be reliable, but the precise rate for each place is not deducible from the data given. The Mount Pleasant and Washington rates are reasonably consistent with the figures for the adjoining counties. The McGregor and Waukon wells, in the northeast corner of the State, although of moderate depth, appear to afford reliable data. The same is true of Council Bluffs, in the extreme western part of the State, where the rate of increase is the same as in the wells at Omaha, across Missouri River 1° in 83 feet.

GEOLOGIC RELATIONS.

The Iowa wells penetrate limestones, shales, and sandstones of Carboniferous to Cambrian age. They lie nearly horizontal, but most of the State is occupied by a broad, open syncline whose axis extends from east and northeast to southwest and passes near Musca'tine, Oscaloosa, Indianola, Osceola, and Bedford. The Algonkian rocks are deeply buried, for they were not reached by the 2,696^-foot hole at Tipton, and no igneous rocks or marked local disturbances are known to be near the wells of which data were recorded. The deeper borings and those in the northeast corner of the State draw from the sandstones of Cambrian or Ordovician age, especially the St. Peter sandstone, which is the source of supply at Tipton and Washington and is about 1,300 feet below the surface at Ottumwa, 1,100 feet at Davenport, 950 feet at Burlington, and 900 feet at Keokuk. The Ames, Amana, Davenport, and Des Moines holes penetrate the Jordan sandstone; the Nevada well draws from much higher limestones of Silurian age. The shallow Burlington and Fort Madison wells draw from strata considerably above the Jordan sandstone. When these facts are considered in connection with the rates of increase given in the table there appears to be no connection between the geologic horizon and the rate, so far as is indicated by the data available.
The abrupt change of rate from 1° in 75 feet to 1° in 272 feet at a depth of about 1,000 feet in the Des Moines well .occurs just below the base of the Devonian.

SUMMA11Y.

Most of the Kansas observations are in fairly close accord as to rates of increases in temperature. The principal exception is that of the Caney boring, which shows a temperature of only 73° at a depth of 2,775 feet. Possibly this is due to gas escape. This hole and those at Independence, Coffeyville, Fort Scott, Girard, Cherokee, and Columbus are all in the southeast corner of the State. The average rate exclusive of Caney is 1° in slightly less than 60 feet. The group of four holes in central Kansas have rates of 1° in 48.7 to 56.2 feet, but the rate decreases to 1° in 74.2 feet in the deep shaft at the Lyons salt mine. Four wells in the western part of the State have rates of 1° in 41, 47, 51 j and 57 feet; the first and third represent careful measurements. There is a great difference in the rates of the two wells at Meade as determined by Johnson.

GEOLOGIC RELATIONS.
The wells in Kansas penetrate a variety of sedimentary formations, but the strata are nearly horizontal and no igneous rocks are known to exist near any of the holes in the list. The wells in the southeast corner of the State are in limestone, shale, and sandstone of Carboniferous age, some of the deeper ones penetrating the .upper part of the Mississippian. The Ellsworth, Lynn, and Sterling wells are in the salt series of the Permian. The Richfield well is in the red beds of the Permian, Garden City, and Kanona in the Dakota sandstone (Upper Cretaceous). The Meade wells reach red beds under a thick mantle of sand and gravel of Tertiary'age. The high rate of increase in the 325-foot well at Meade, 1° in 21.7 feet, may be related to a fault supposed to extend along one side of the artesian basin.

SUMMARY.

The old Louisville artesian well with a large flow should give a
reliable indication of the rate of increase, but two widely different temperatures are reported. The result for the Harrisburg well is dubious. The Fountain Farm well is gassy, but the rate is reasonable.

GEOLOGIC RELATIONS.
The strata penetrated by the wells listed in the table are limestone and shale of Paleozoic age on the west slope of the Cincinnati arch, and the dips are very low. The Louisville hole penetrates Devonian, Silurian, and Ordovician strata. The Fountain Farm well penetrates Mississippian limestone to the Devonian black shale.

LOUISIANA.

BELLE ISLAND.

The most significant determination of underground temperature in Louisiana is one made for me by I. N. Knapp in February, 1909, during the sinking of a 3,171-foot boring at Belle Island, near Morgan City. A Darton thermometer was lowered to various depths with the following results.:

At 427, 764, and 975 feet the instrument was down 36 hours. It was sent down again 24 hours later, obtaining closely accordant results. At 1,625 feet there was much gas, which caused a diminished temperature, so no observations were made at greater depths. The beds below 211 feet were salt or salt bearing. The rates of increase were as follows, as calculated from a mean annual temperature of 68.7° (Franklin average for 24 years plus 0.2°):

Harris * gives results of his own observations for many wells, notably those in St. Tammany and Tangipahoa parishes, and Veatch 2 gives records from various sources, but only in a few of the records is information given as to the source of the water. However, as the pressures are such as to indicate considerable depth, and as the materials are soft, it is probable that the wells are cased to or nearly to the bottom. If so, the temperature records are valuable as indicating approximately the rate of increase with depth.

Water from pumped wells 197 to 315 feet deep in Bossier Parish is reported to have temperatures from 64° to 66°; from a 225-foot well at Belcher, in Caddo Parish, 66°; from wells 137 to 280 feet deep at Shreveport, 66° to 68°; and from severalwells 115 to 368 feet deep in Webster Parish, 65° to 66 0 .1 All these figures are so near the mean annual air temperature that they throw no light on the rate of increase.
SUMMARY.

None of the rates of the deeper wells given in the list are close approximations. In the Frierson and Negreet wells probably the mingling of flows gives a lower temperature than the water from the lower flow would show. The wells of Tangipahoa Parish are too shallow to be reliable within close limits, but they give an average rate of 1 ° in very nearly 80 feet.

GEOLOGIC RELATIONS.
All the wells in Louisiana are in the great Coastal Plain sedimentary series of the Mississippi embayment, but several horizons are tapped. The strata are sands, clays, and limestones of Cretaceous and Tertiary age, dipping at low angles in various directions. In northern Louisiana there is a general dip to the east into a basin whose bottom is near Vicksburg, Miss., at a rate of generally from 7 to 10 feet to the mile, with few local variations, some of which are due to sharp local uplifts. This basin widens and deepens to the south and becomes a deep, wide trough containing a great thickness of Tertiary strata. The briny waters of the Shreveport well come from the Nacatoch sand in the Upper Cretaceous, and the brine at the Drake salt works is also from the Cretaceous.. Brine from the Leland well is believed to be from the Eocene Yegua ("Cockfield") formation, 1,500 feet higher. The beds tapped by the shallow wells of Calcasieu, St. Tammany, and Tangipahoa parishes are high in the Tertiary.
MARYLAND.
Only one well temperature was obtained from Maryland that of the 140-galJon flow of saline water from the deep well at Crisfield, Somerset County, on the eastern peninsula. The flow comes from a depth of 1,025,feet in the Potomac group, and the temperature, 79°, was determined by Mr. John Buxton with a reliable thermometer sent to him for the purpose. As the mean annual temperature at Pocomoke City, not far away, is 57.4°, this determination indicates a rate of increase of 1° in 47.4 feet.

50 GEOTHERMAL DATA OF THE UNITED STATES.
MICHIGAN.
SOURCES OF INFORMATION.
Temperature observations that have been made in deep borings and deep mines in Michigan throw important light on the rate of increase in temperature underground. Some of these have been made by A. C. Lane, 1 in part with thermometers which I furnished. On account of the differences in the geology of the two areas it is best to present the results of observations made in southern and central Michigan separately from those of observations made in the area of older rocks in the northern peninsula. Lane has considered the probable mean annual temperature of the northern peninsula and also gives temperatures in shallow borings and in upper levels in certain copper mines.
NORTHERN PENINSULA.
Many determinations of underground temperature are available for the northern part of Michigan, mainly in connection with the deep mines. . In 1895 Alexander Agassiz 2 reported the results of a series of observations made in copper mines of the Calumet & Hecla Co. on Keweenaw Point. This point, which extends 70 miles out into Lake Superior, consists of a series of old igneous and sedimentary rocks dipping 7°-55° and overlain by Cambrian sandstone. The mines are mostly in the older series. The temperatures were taken at intervals, but only those at 105 feet and 4,580 feet were published. Negretti and Zambra thermometers were used, placed in 10-foot holes, slightly inclined upward, and left from one to three months, the holes plugged with woqd and clay. The results were 59° and 79°, a difference of only 20° for the 4,475 feet, or an increase of 1° in 223.7 feet. However, if the 59° observation is disregarded and the increase to 4,580 feet calculated from a mean annual air temperature of 43° 3 the result is 1° in 127 feet, which is borne out by other observations. It is evident that the reading of 59° at 105 feet was defective, because it is 16° to 20° higher than the mean annual air temperature.
In a letter to J. D. Everett in 1896, 4 Agassiz stated that further observations had shown that the rate was "different from what it was believed to be when the preliminary announcement was made."

2 Agassiz, Alexander, On underground temperatures at great depth: Am. Jour. Sci., 3d ser., vol. 50, pp. 503-504, 1895.
3 The mean annual air temperature at Calumet is 39.7° (29-year average), but shallow-water and mine workings indicate several degrees higher, according to Lane.

Wheeler states that the most satisfactory results were obtained in the Atlantic mine, where observations at intermediate stations gave an accordant rate. The Conglomerate mine is 36 miles farther east. The rate in the Tamarack mine may be vitiated by the proximity of active mining. All the mines were nearly dry. Wheeler suggests that the low rate of increase in this district may be due to the proximity of Lake Superior, with its great volume of cool water (38. 8°).

MINNESOTA.
Few temperatures of flows from wells hr Minnesota have been reported and the source of the flows is uncertain. The large flow from a 467-foot well at Winona is stated to have a temperature of 54°, which may indicate a rate of increase of 1° in 47 feet if the water is from the bottom. This well penetrates sandstones of Cambrian age which lie on granite at a depth of about 500 feet. The beds are nearly horizontal. The 600-gallon flow from a 707foot well at Henderson, in Sibley County, is stated to have a temperature of 50°, but doubtless part of the water is from beds some distance above the bottom.

MISSISSIPPI.

TEMPERATURES.
Temperatures of several flowing wells in Mississippi have been recorded by G. D. Harris l and others, and as most of the wells flow in large volume and appear to be cased to the bottom the temperatures indicate approximate rates of increase. The Biloxi well, with readings at 500 and 900 feet, is of particular interest.

SUMMARY.

The rates of increase deduced in Mississippi show considerable variation, but this may be due, in part at least, to lack of information as to source of water, notably in the wells at Canton, Vicksburg, and Sartartia. If, as stated, the Scranton well draws from the bottom, a low rate is indicated.

GEOLOGIC RELATIONS.
The Bay St. Louis, Biloxi, Pass Christian, and Scranton wells are in the higher Tertiary strata of the southern part of the State. All these strata dip gently to south or west. The Vicksburg, Sartartia, and Canton wells are deep in the Tertiary. The Columbia well is in the Cretaceous.

SUMMARY.

The data from the Missouri wells listed above appear to indicate considerable diversity in gradient, but doubtless some of this diversity is due to error, especially as to source .of water. The tests by Broadhead and Litten in the deep wells of St. Louis are most valuable, giving mean rates of increase of 1° in about 78 and 85 feet. The apparent decrease of 2° from 3,127 to 3,843 feet and some other inconsistent variations are difficult to explain. Some of the shallower wells appear to indicate a diminishing rate toward the surface, but uncertainty as to source of flow and influence of pumping may affect the observations. The Clinton well, which is said to.be cased to the bottom, indicates the surprisingly low rate of 1° in 175 feet, and the Sullivan well shows a .rate of 1° in 153 feet. The rates indicated for the Springfield well, 1° in 138 feet; the Canton well, 1° in 132 feet; the Hahatonka well, 1° in 131 feet; and the Fayette well, 1° in 113 feet, are valid if, as is reported, all these wells are cased to or nearly to the bottom. The data from Mexico, Excelsior Springs, Hannibal, Louisiana, Montgomery, Moberly, and Randolph Springs may be defective. The relatively high rates of 1° in 52 feet indicated by the Campbell well and 1° in 53 feet by the Utica well

58 GEOTHERMAL DATA OF THE UNITED STATES.
are exceptional but almost surely correct. The rate indicated by the St. Joseph brewery well, l°.in 60£ feet, is also regarded as reliable, although the source of the water is not given precisely.
GEOLOGIC EELATIONS.
The southeastern third of Missouri consists of a low dome hi the center of which the pre-Cambrian granites and other rocks are exposed in the Iron Mountain region. West of this dome, the strata dip west, and north of it they slope gently to the north and northwest. At Kansas City and northward the pre-Cambrian rocks are far below the surface. The wells included in the above list penetrate a great variety of strata, all on the north or west slopes of the dome. The 3,843-foot hole at St. Louis is the only one that reached the granite, but its water supply is derived from sandstones of Ordovician age. The wells at Moberly, Hannibal, Canton, Lagrange, Louisiana, Rensselaer, Gunters, Hahatonka, Fayette, Sullivan, Montgomery, Springfield, Nevada, and Richards all draw from sandstones in the Ordovician or Cambrian. The deep well near St. Joseph entered Mississippian limestones at 1,250 feet and possibly reached the St. Peter sandstone. The deep borings of Excelsior Springs are believed to draw their mineralized waters from the "Jefferson City limestone and base of the Pennsylvanian." 1 The well at Campbell, in the southeast corner of the State, penetrates a thick deposit of clay of the Lagrange formation (Tertiary) and draws from the sand of the upper part of the Ripley formation (Cretaceous). The well at Utica draws water from the base of the Cherokee shale (Pennsylvanian).
There is no evidence that the variations in rate of increase in temperature are related to the horizons from which the waters are derived, to structural features, or to proximity to the pre-Cambrian rocks, with the possible exception of the high rate at the Campbell well, which is in the Tertiary and Cretaceous. The St. Joseph and Utica wells which show high rates are higher in the Paleozoic succession than the wells farther east and south.
MONTANA.
ANACONDA MINE.
In 1899 H. V. Winchell made a series of observations in the Anaconda mine, near Butte. He placed Darton thermometers in drill holes at various depths and left them for several days. The following, results were obtained:

o Based on mean annual air temperature of 42°, average for 21 years at Butte.

The reading at a depth of 800 feet is abnormally high, probably on account of some local, condition. The rates of increase indicated between various depths are as follows: 200 to 1,600 feet, 1° in 49.8 feet; 400 to 1,000 feet, 1° in 48.2 feet; 400 to 1,600 feet, 1° in 48.5 feet; 600 to 1,600 feet, 1° in 43.6 feet; 1,000 to 1,600 feet, 1° in 48.8 feet. S. F. Emmons made an additional observation in the Gagnon mine 1,550 feet below the surface. The Darton thermometer was placed in a 3-foot drill hole and read 79° after 48 hours and 79^° after 7 days. As the mean annual temperature here is 42° the rate indicated is l°in 41.7 feet. This mine is the nearest one to the latest rhyolite eruption.
MILES CITY.

The flow from a 456-foot well in Miles City, Ouster County, is reported l to have a temperature of 57°. Its volume is 5 gallons a minute and its pressure 7 pounds. Flows were also found at 300 and 390 feet, but presumably they are cased off. The mean annual air temperature at this place is 44.1° (average for 39 years), or 12.9° less than the temperature of the flow^ a difference indicating a rate of increase of 1° in 35.3 feet.

n Calculated from average of mean annual air temperature at Plains and Kalispell, 43.4° plus 0.2°. b Reported to have been 126° three years before; the volume of flow has also diminished.

The temperatures of flow from wells 52, 82, and 90 feet deep were 57£°, 53°, and 59^°, respectively, and flows from two of the deeper wells had low temperatures. Water in a 94-foot dug well at Lone Pine post office had a temperature of 52£°. The water occurs in a bed of sand and gravel underlying a thick mass of silt supposed to have been deposited by a lake. Meinzer suggests that the variations in temperature in these wells, which are all near together, probably indicates that the warmer water comes in part from some deeper source. The Camas Hot Springs are in the northwest corner of sec. 3, T. 21 N., R. 24 W.

SUMMARY.
The rates of increase indicated at Lincoln and Omaha are moderate and apparently are fairly close approximations. The many records of flowing wells in the lowlands along Missouri River in Boyd, Cedar, Dixon, and Knox counties all show high rates and in general are closely accordant. From these records lines in Plate I, showing relations to the South Dakota area, have been drawn. Most of the records show rates of increase of 1° in 22 to 30 feet, and there is a .notably warm spot in the area southwest of Vermilion. Possibly some higher temperatures in some of the shallower wells are due to waters rising from lower beds, and it may be that all the high temperatures are due to this cause, if this area is a zone of permeable strata in which such a rise would be possible.

GEOLOGIC EELATIONS.
The many artesian wells in Cedar, Knox, Dixon, and Boyd counties draw their water from the Dakota sandstone, which underlies shales of Benton age-and lies on Paleozoic limestone and possibly in part also in pre-Cambrian rocks. The beds are nearly horizontal

and apparently have no local disturbances or notable stratigraphic differences, so that no suggestions can be offered to account for the variations of gradient in relation to the geology. The Omaha wells penetrate deeply into Paleozoic limestone that lie n,early horizontal. The deep boring at Lincoln passed through very slightly tilted Paleozoic limestones and sandstones and reached quartzite that is supposed to be of pre-Cambrian age.

NEVADA.

COMSTOCK LODE.
The high temperatures in the deep workings of the Comstock lode near Virginia City are well known through the extended investigations of G. F/Becker.1 The temperature at a depth of 3,100 feet was found to be 170°, indicating a rate of increase of 1° in 28 feet, and an elaborate series of temperature determinations in drill holes at various depths gave an average rate of 1° in 33 feet. The rate decreases horizontally away from the lode. It is believed that the high rate in the Comstock lode indicates the presence of hot volcanic material a few miles underground, and that ascending water is the mportant factor in the transportation of the heat. As a 1 arge number of data are presented, the reader interested in details should consult the monograph cited, also a critical review by Locke.2

TONOPAH.
Leon Dominiau made measurements of underground temperatures in the Mizpah Extension, Ohio Tonopah, and Montana Tonopah shafts at Tonopah.3 These shafts had very limited side workings and no complete ventilation. The thermometers were placed in shallow drill holes. The following results were obtained:

From 400 to 780 feet in the Mizpah it is 1° in 54.3 feet, and from 400 to 766 feet in the Ohio it is 1 ° in 26.1 feet. Spurr in comparing the Tonopah and Comstock data points out the fact that the temperature at 766 feet in the Ohio Tonopah was found in the Comstock at 900 feet, and he suggests that the increased rate toward the bottom may be due to proximity to a "local heat focus, such as a hot spring." The lack of a record of mean annual air temperature at Tonopah makes it difficult to compute the gradient. The average given by the Weather Bureau for 1916 is 48.9°. The temperature of 60° at a depth of 100 feet therefore shows a rapid increase in the upper part of
the mine.

SUMMARY.
The wells on the coast of New Jersey from Asbury Park to Wildwood show rates of increase that seem closely accordant when the possible plus and minus is considered. In general there is an increase to the south from 1° in 55.3 and 52 feet at Asbury Park and Ocean Grove to 1° in 59 feet at Atlantic City and Longport and 1° in 69 feet in the 655-foot well at Wildwood.
GEOLOGIC RELATIONS.
All these wells draw their water from sands in the Coastal Plain sedimentary series,1 which dips gently to the east and lies on a platform of pre-Cambrian crystalline rocks. The Asbury Park, Ocean City, and Sea Girt wells draw from sands in the Miocene. It would appear from these facts that there may be a lower rate in the higher beds, but the data are not sufficiently numerous or reliable to prove it.
NEW MEXICO.
Temperature determinations were made by W. T. Lee in September, 1905, in the well at Sandia siding, on the Atchisori, Topeka & Santa Fe Railway, 11^ miles southwest of Isleta. A deep-well thermometer was used, with precautions to obtain accurate data. The water stood at a depth of 445 feet in the boring, which was 843 feet deep and penetrated Cretaceous shale and sandstone, overlain by sand of the Tertiary Santa Fe formation at the edge of the sheet of recent lava which covers the plateau to the north and east. The following. results were obtained:

843 feet............................ 78.1 543 feet........................... 72.1 743 feet........................... 76. V 443 feet........................... 71.7 643 feet........................... 75. 6
If 54.5°, the mean annual air temperature at Los Lunas (average for 27 years), which is at.about the same latitude, although 400 feet lower, is taken as a standard, the rates of increase indicated by these results are as follows:
Depth per degree of increase in temperature in well at Sandia siding, N. Mex. Feet. Feet.
Surface to 843 feet.................. 35} Surface to 443 feet.................. 25} Surface to 743 feet.................. 35 443 to 843 feet..................... 62} Surface to 643 feet.................. 30} 643 to 843 feet..................... 80 Surface to 543 feet.................. 31 443 to 643 feet..................... 51
The variability, especially in the amount of change from depth to depth as taken, may be due to convection, but the rate at the bottom is doubtless near the true one.

NORTH CAROLINA.
No significant well temperatures have been reported from North Carolina. The water flowing from the 985-foot well at Wilmington has a temperature of 70°, or about 7° higher than the mean annual air temperature, but the flows mingle from depths of 379, 496, 578, 608, 734, and 985 feet.
NORTH DAKOTA.
Nettleton l has given temperatures of flows of several wells in North Dakota. The determinations were probably made with care, and as the flows come from the bottoms of the wells and most of them are of large volume the data give a close approximation of the rate of increase.

These borings are in Cretaceous shale and obtain water from the Dakota sandstone, which lies on or not far above the pre-Canabrian basement. The data from the Hamilton well are doubtless inaccurate as to the depth from whicn the water comes, or there is a chilling of the small flow near the surface.

OHIO.

FINDLAY.
The most important data on underground temperature in Ohio are the measurements in the 2,980-foot hole at Findlay by John Johnson.2 The hole, which was a test for oil or gas, began in the Niagara limestone and continued through older Silurian, Ordovician, and Cam-

Some gas coming from beds at a depth of 770 feet probably vitiated the readings in that vicinity. Readings after 18 hours continuously at 100 feet gave 51.8°, which is 1.4° higher than the mean average air temperature from 27 years' observations by the United States Weather Bureau.

The Cleveland well is pumped and the water in whole or part may come from higher beds. Temperatures were taken in the bottom of the old Columbus well and at 3,020, 2,800, and 1,400 feet in the Plymouth well. In the Plymouth well the rate of increase from 1,400 to 2,800 feet is 1° iii 76.2 feet, and from 1,400 to 3,020 feet 1° in 70.5 feet. The strata in all these holes are limestones, sandstones, and shales dipping at; low angles. The Columbus and Plymouth wells penetrated to a horizon low in the Ordovician. The Cleveland hole was sunk for water in sandstone of Devonian age.

SUMMARY.
All the borings tested are in the northeastern part of the State except the one at McAlester, which is considerably south of the others. The results show a considerable range in the geothermal gradient, but exclusive of the pumping well at Norman, the old hole at Fallis, and the deep boring at Meridian the rate of increase is 1 ° in 34 to 62 feet. The boring at Meridian was in progress and may have been chilled by the pumping of cool surface water to remove the drillings. All the conditions in the Fallis well are not known, but they appeared to be favorable for a reliable test. For many "of the localities there is some uncertainty as to the mean annual air temperature, which had to be approximated from stations at some distance. The holes in Pawnee and Tulsa counties and at Yale and Rampna, which show rates of 1° in 30 to 40 feet, appear to be consistent in indicating a high rate of increase for at least a portion of the central-northeastern part of the State.
, GEOLOGIC RELATIONS.
The borings all penetrate limestone and shale of Carboniferous age, which dip at a low angle to the west and southwest. There are no notable local disturbances and no igneous rocks, and the pre-Cambrian rocks lie far below the surface.

A similar hole on Potts Run near Mahanoy City, in the same county, found a 200-gallon flow with a' temperature of 51°, but the depth below the surface is not stated.
Except those in the holes in coal in the Dorrance and Sloan mines the rates of increase are remarkably low. The reasons for the differences in the others, however, are not apparent. In the holes near Scranton and Wilkes-Barre the strata are in a wide syncline with gentle dips and with a few local crenulations. In the Auchincloss mine the beds are highly tilted and faulted. The test in this mine was made in a 115-foot hole in one of the lower chambers, through which passes a ventilating current. The Glen Lyon hole and the Lehigh & Wilkes-Barre Co. bore holes are in steeply tilted strata.

The Pottsville shaft was an abandoned shaft at a mine that had been full of water for several years. This and the remaining observations in the table were made in the southern anthracite basin, where the strata lie in a deep syncline with rather steep dips on the sides.

WEST ELIZABETH.
A well 5,386 feet deep has been put down on Peters Creek about 2£ miles west of West Elizabeth and about 12 miles south-southeast of Pittsburgh. The rocks are nearly horizontal and comprise strata from those not far below the Pittsburgh coal bed to those near the base of the Devonian. Temperatures in this well were taken by William Hallock1 in 1897, by lowering four thermometers to a depth of 5,000 feet and leaving them suspended for 16 hours. The reading waa 120.9°, an increase of 68.2° over the mean annual air temperature at Pittsburgh for 46 years (52.7°), which indicates a rate of 1° to 73.3 feet. A reading at 2,350 feet gave about 78°, indicating a somewhat higher rate, but this observation was not considered satisfactory.
MCDONALD.

Some preliminary information regarding a 6,975-foot hole 4 miles northwest of McDonald, 15 miles southwest of Pittsburgh, has been given by I. C. White and C. E. Van Orstrand.2 Until recently this was the deepest hole in the United States. Precise determinations of temperature have been made by C. E. Van Orstrand, some of which are as follows:

The rate indicated by the temperature at 5,380 feet is 1° in feet, calculated from the mean annual air temperature at Pittsburgh, 52.7°; the difference from 525 to 5,380 feet is 1° in about 69 feet.
Mr. C. E. Van Orstrand 2 found that the temperature was 142° at a depth of 6,100 feet. With a temperature of about 55° at 100 feet the rate of increase is 1 ° in about 70 feet.

PITTSBURGH.
An 1,826-foot hole at the American Iron & Steel Works in the 24th ward in Pittsburgh found a strong flow of water at 1,535 to 1,606 feet with a temperature of 68°, 3 which indicates a rate of 1° in about 100 feet. The water was somewhat gassy.

The tests were of only five to ten minutes duration, but exclusive of the reading at 3,710 feet, where the temperature was probably lowered by gas, the rate appears to be reasonable. The increasing rate downward is a peculiar feature.

SUMMARY.
As the Charleston wells are cased to or nearly to the bottom, presumably the others are also. The temperatures are probably reliable, especially those of the Charleston wells. The new well at the electric-light plant is cased to a depth of 1,869 feet, and the flow comes from-a bed extending from 1,971 to 1,999 feet. The results of the Charleston and Fort Moultrie wells are fairly accordant and give an average rate of 1° in about 60 feet. It is possible that the lower rates indicated by the wells at Greenpond and Johns Island are due to ingress of water above the bottoms of the borings.
GEOLOGIC RELATIONS.
These wells all penetrate clays, sands, and gravels of the thick we'dge of Tertiary and Cretaceous strata constituting the Coastal Plain. These strata dip very gently eastward and lie on an eastward sloping floor of old crystalline rocks. The Charleston wells reach the basal beds of the Black Creek formation, which is low in the Upper Cretaceous; the other holes in the list reach sands of Eocene age.

SOUTH DAKOTA.
TEMPERATURES.
In the course of detailed investigations of the geology and water resources of parts of South Dakota I and my associates have observed many underground temperatures, mainly of the flow of artesian wells. Some carefully determined temperatures of representative wells have been recorded by Sheppard,1 and several tests were made by Nettleton.2 Records of wells at Belle Fourche, Cheyenne Agency, and Edgemont were obtained from correspondents. A large number of data were obtained by J. E. Todd 3 in field work for geologic folios and reports on the artesian area in Beadle, Brown, Edmunds, Faulk, Hand, and Spink counties, in the eastern part of the State. His observations were made with instruments that had been verified in Washington. No flow was tested unless-it was believed to be of sufficient volume to give a closely approximate indication of the temperature at the bottom.

80 GEOTHERMAL DATA OF THE UNITED STATES.
SUMMARY.
Of the 281 wells given in the above list all but 8 are in the region east of the Missouri. A large proportion of these are in Beadle, Brown, Faulk, Edmunds, Hand, and Spink counties, where many are close together. Records from representative wells in Aurora, Bon Homme, Buffalo, Charles Mix, Davison, Day, Douglas, Gregory, Hughes, Hutchinson, Hyde, Jerauld, Kingsbury, Marshall, -Sanborn, and Yankton counties indicate the geothermal gradient in an area of wide extent. The deep artesian wells at Cheyenne Agency, with a rate of increase of 1° in about 35 feet; at the head of Oak Creek,, northeast of Rosebud, with a rate of 1° in 23£ feet; and at Kennebec, with a rate of 1° in nearly 26 feet, extend the area. The flow from the Highmore well is too small to give a reliable indication of , the temperature of the water at the source of the flow. In Plate I are shown the principal data for the eastern part of the State. The figures indicate feet to the degree of increase in representative wells. The lines connect wells of the same rates for 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, and 50 feet to the degree and delimit the zones of intermediate rates. They are not isogeotherms, but if the well temperatures were calculated to some uniform depth, such as 500 to 1,000 *feet, and these connected by isogeothermal lines, these lines would be parallel to the rate lines on the map.
In general, it will be seen from Plate I that the rate is nearly uniform in groups of wells, but it varies from place to place with most remarkable regularity. In the James River valley from Ashton to Aberdeen it is 1° in 40 to 45 feet. To the west and to the south through Redfield and in the east-central part of Beadle County it is 1° in less than 35 to 40 feet. At Wolsey and Alpena it is 1° in about 23 feet, and at Pierre, Crow Creek, and Chamberlain it is 1° in less than 30 feet. This zone of high rates extends down the Missouri Valley through Springfield and Yankton counties, S. Dak., and the northern part of Boyd, Knox, Cedar, and Dixon counties, Nebr. At Fort Randall the rate reaches a maximum of 1° in 17^ feet. The rate decreases rapidly to the north and east, as shown 'by scattered wells in Brule, Aurora, Davison, Douglas, Hutchinson, Sanborn, and Bon Homme counties. The rapid change from Springfield to Tyndall and the regular but less rapid diminution from. Alpena to Mitchell are notable features in the "cooler" area.
The records in the western part of the State-are diverse. The flow from a 515-foot well near Belle Fourche had a temperature of 54°, indicating a rate of 1° in 51 £ feet, but a flow at 323 feet gave a less rate. The flow from the Orman well, 1,417 feet deep, with a temperature of 94°, indicated a rate of 1° in 28.3 feet, and the large flow from the 2,985-foot well at Edgemont indicated a rate of 1° in

representation of it and the data used in constructing the map are set forth in my report on the geology of South Dakota.1
TENNESSEE.
Only two well temperatures that appear to throw light on the geothermal gradient have been reported from Tennessee. One is at Covington, where, according to Glenn,2 the railroad well, 533 feet deep, has water within 31 feet of the surface, with a temperature of 66°. As the mean annual air temperature at this place is 60.1°, a rate of increase of 1° in 90 feet is indicated. The water is in coarse sand under clay in the young deposits of the Mississippi embayment.
TEXAS.
TEMPERATURES.
No special determinations of underground temperature have been made in deep holes in Texas, but there are numerous records of the temperature of waters from artesian wells. Some of these records are reliable, and a few of them indicate the depth from which the flow is derived. The data are given in the following list. They are derived partly from published reports and partly from replies to circulars. Some late observations have been made by Mr. C. E. Van Orstrand, but the results are not yet published.

SUMMARY.
It is difficult to judge the relative values of the Texas temperature records. Some may not be correct, and others may not represent the temperature at the depth stated owing to the mingling of flows. The flow from the deep well at Marlin is supposed to come from a depth of 3,350'feet, and if so it indicates a rate of 1° in 42 feet. The several wells at Waco, not far southeast of Marlin, give rates of 1° in 49$ to 53 feet. Other wells in the same county (McLennan) indicate 1° in 48, 64, 66$, 69, and 56 feet, but the apparent lower rate is possibly due to the ingress of higher waters. The warm flow from a depth of 1,380 feet at China Springs, 12 miles northwest of Waco, indicates the exceptionally high rate of 1° in nearly 37 feet. A similar rate is indicated by the Clifton well in Bosque County, about 25 miles northwest of China Springs. The three deep wells at Corsicana, still farther north, give a rate of 1° in 40 to 41$ feet. Fort Worth has a rate of 1° in 18$ feet if all the flow is derived from a depth of 1,127 feet, as stated. The rate at Nacogdoches may be as high as 1° in 39$ feet if the flow comes from a depth of 340 feet. The Austin wells indicate rates of 1° in 48$ and 51 feet, but the true rate here may be considerably less if the flow is from a deeper source' than the depth used in the calculations. The Round Rock figure is uncertain, but the rates for Hempstead and Navasota appear to be valid. The data for Harris County, Port Arthur, and Beaumont are not satisfactory,, and the wells 2 miles south of San Antonio and at Cotulla and Temple may not give reliable data. The temperature given for the San Marcos well is doubtless unreliable. The five wells in Hardin County appear to have rates of 1° in 21$, 27$, 30, 31, and 34 feet, without likelihood of much error. The Big Hill 722-foot well has a similar rate, and the High Island well evidently indicates a steep rate. The rate indicated by the Galveston County wells varies, but the figures 60 and 63 feet to the degree appear the most accurate, there being uncertainty as to the source of the water in the others. As the water at Fort Bliss is pumped the temperature given may not be as high as that in the bottom of the well, but the figure given (76°) indicates that the rate is 1° in at least 31 feet.
GEOLOGIC RELATIONS.
The wells in the above list penetrate a great variety of formations, which are mostly, however, of Cretaceous and Tertiary age. In most parts of the area the shales are tilted at low angles and in places traversed by faults. No igneous rocks are reported near any of the wells listed, and the granites or other old bedrocks are far beneath the surface. The wells in the southeastern part of the State and along the coast draw from sands of Tertiary age. In the oil fields of Hardin County there are sharp local uplifts or domes. The Nacogdoches well draws from lower beds in the Eocene.

86 GEOTHERMAL DATA OF THE UNITED STATES.
The group of wells extending from north Nto south across the center of the State draw their waters from sands in the Trinity group, which is low in the Cretaceous. The deep boring at Fort Worth passed through the base of these sands and penetrated the Paleozoic rocks for more than 2,000 feet. At Marlin, hi Falls County, where the lowest sand lies deep, it was necessary to sink 3,330 feet to reach it. The Corsicana wells draw from the Woodbine sand, in the Upper Cretaceous, considerably above the highest beds of the Trinity. The 1,900-foot well 2 miles south of San Antonio is believed to have not quite reached the base of the Edwards limestone.1 The San Marcos and San Antonio wells are situated near a great fault. The Fort Bliss well draws from the Quaternary valley fill.

a Calculated from Milford mean for 1916, 48.2°. Water in wells 60 to 66 feet deep is stated to have a temperature of 51° to 55°.

The waters are decidedly thermal considering the slight depths of the wells. The cause of the heat is not apparent. Probably the two wells in the list showing temperatures of 53° and 54° are cooled by pumping or by the ingress of shallow water.
All these wells are in the Quaternary clay, sand, and gravel deposits of the Lake Bonneville basin. The boring at Neels reached granite.

VIRGINIA.
RICHMOND COAL FIELD.
In 1836 to 1842 Rogers l determined temperatures in the coal mines in the Newark group west of Richmond, Va., the results of which he discussed ^at considerable length. The coal measures consist mostly of sandstone lying in a basin underlain by granitic rocks; the coal is in the basal beds. The strata have steep dips and are greatly broken, and owing to this condition a large amount of water penetrates into the mines. The following results were obtained:

a Calculated from mean annual air temperature at Richmond, 58.5° (37-year average to 1916) minus 0.5° for difference in the altitude and latitude. Rogers used 56.75°.

The first observation was made in a mine in operation and the last four in shafts just completed or in progress. Exclusive of the three first and one in the new Black Heth shaft, the average rate indicated by the others is 1° in 82 feet.
The figures indicate a less rate in the old workings than in the new shafts, a difference which may be due to the cooling by seepage and ventilation. Rogers made the following comments on the
results:
Comparing the three last observations, the two former of which were made in the same shaft and the last in one only a few hundred feet removed, there is ground for inferring that the rate at which the temperature increases grows less as the depth augments. In descending from 330 feet to 600 that is, through 270 feet the rise of temperature is 4.5°; while in descending from 600 to 780, or through 280 feet, the riseisonly 2.5°. This difference would, I think, have been less could I have obtained the temperature at 780 feet free from the cooling influence of the copious drippings from above. Yet even with the most liberal allowance, there would still remain evidence of a diminishing rate of increase with the depth.

88 GEOTHERMAL DATA OF THE UNITED STATES.
Rogers considered the observations at 330 and 600 feet in the Midlothian shaft the most reliable, and these give a rate of 1° in 88 and 74 feet, respectively; the difference between them is 1° in 60 feet. The rate for the 780-foot reading (1° in 72 feet) is accordant, although, as suggested by Rogers, the water may be cooled slightly by drippings from above.
FORT MONROE.
In 1902 a 2,130-foot boring was made at Fort Monroe, and Capt. C. P. Townsley kindly lowered a Darton thermometer in it. After two hours the instrument recorded 92.5°. As the mean annual air temperature at Newport News is about 59.4°, a rate of 1° in 64 feet is indicated. The boring passed through Tertiary and Cretaceous formations of the Coastal Plain to the basement of pre-Cambrian granite. The hole was full of salty water.
REEDVILLE.
At Reedville, in Northumberland County, the 85-gallon flow from a 680-foot well is reported to have a temperature of 78°. As calculated from the mean annual air temperature at Warsaw, 56.4°, a rate of 1° in 31£ feet is indicated.
WASHINGTON.
YAKIMA ARTESIAN BASIN.
There are numerous flowing wells in the vicinity of Yakima which afford data as to underground temperature. In most of them, however, several flows are intermixed, so that the observations do not indicate the temperature at any definite depth. There are three wells which reach the upper flow only and three others in which the casing is so set that only one flow can enter. They are in an area about 1J miles long.and within 120 feet elevation. The data for these six wells, as given by Geo. Otis Smith,1 are as follows:

It was noted by Smith that the rate of increase is highest in the shallower wells.
Waring 1 has reported that a large flow from a well on the Yakima Indian Reservation, in sec. 34, T. 11 N., R. 18 E., has a temperature of 68°. The main flow is from a depth of 507-512 feet, possibly with a small admixture of water from 492 feet. The rate indicated by this observation is 1° in about 28 feet.
Russell'2 has given temperatures of flows from several wells in the Yakima Valley, but the flows are small and the source of the water is not definitely located. One of these wells, in sec. 31, T. 13 N., R. 20 E., has a 2-gallon flow with a temperature of 73° from a depth of 886 feet; another, in sec. 3, T. 12 N., R. 20 E., only 314 feet deep, has a flow with a temperature of 75°.

WALLA WALLA.
In 1909 I noted the temperature of the large flows from several wells on the Blalock ranch west of Walla Walla. The flow from one well, 611 feet deep, had a temperature of 66.5°; that from another of similar depth, 67.25°; and that from a 563-foot well, 67°. It is stated that the casings extend to a depth of 540 feet to a 20-foot sheet of basalt under which is the water-bearing sand. As the mean annual air temperature of Walla Walla is 53.4° (23-year average) a rate of 1° in 41.4 feet is indicated, if the flow comes from a depth of 563 feet.
WHITMAN COUNTY.
It is reported that the flow from a 110-foot well at Pullman has a temperature of 60°, and that from a 176-foot well at Tekoa a temperature of 76°, but these figures may not be reliable. As the mean annual air temperature at Colfax is 47.8° and at Rosalia 46.5°, they indicate a very high rate. Doubtless heat from old lava flows is the cause.
WEST VIRGINIA.
There are many deep borings in West Virginia, and temperatures in a number of them have been determined by the late William Hallock,3 by Johnson and Adams/ and by Van Orstrand.5

WHEELING.
The well tested by Hallock was on Boggs Run, 4 miles southeast of Wheeling. It was 4,771 feet deep, and although water was found at moderate depths it was cased off by 1,570 feet of 4£-inch casing, so that the hole was dry when finished. The strata penetrated are nearly horizontal and begin high in the Carboniferous coal measures. Ordinary United States Signal Service self-registering thermometers were used. The foliowhig figures were obtained. Observations made two years later in water gave very closely accordant results. (See below.)

According to the Weather Bureau observations for 39 years the mean annual air temperature at Wheeling is 56.3°, but Hallock used 51.3°, the temperature found at a depth of 110 feet in a near-by coal mine. I believe 51.3° is too low, for temperatures taken in mine galleries are misleading. Two years later water at a depth of 103 feet in the deep well was found to have a temperature of 52.5°. The rate calculated to a depth of 4,462 feet from a mean annual air temperature of 56° is close to 1° in 83 feet; the rate from 1,350 to 4,462 feet is 1° in 75.2 feet; from 2,990 to 4,462 feet, 1° in 62.5 feet.
After taking temperatures in the deep hole near Wheeling when it was dry, Hallock l had opportunity to make an additional series two years later, when water stood within 40 feet of the top.

These determinations show that there is no important difference between the air and water temperatures in a hole.
Hallock made a few observations at a deep boring at Radsford, W. Va., but as the hole was wet he did not complete .the determinations.
CHELYAN.

Johnson and Adams made many tests in the lower part of the 5,236-

foot hole at Chelyan, near Charleston. The results appear to indi-

cate a temperature of about 129° in the bottom. With a mean annual

of 57.6°, average of 14 years at Charleston, this indicates a rate of

1° in 73.3 feet.

MANNINGTON.

The temperature determinations in the Hibbs No. 4 hole near Mannington were made with an electric resistance thermometer by Johnson and Adams and later with a mercury thermometer by Van Orstrand.

TEMPERATURES.
Temperatures of flows of certain Wisconsin wells are given in the reports of the State Survey 2 and water-supply papers of the United States Geological Survey, but for the most part the depth from which the flows are derived is not given, and some of the wells are pumped. The following selected list may afford a few data of value:

SUMMARY.
Exclusive of Sheboygan, Elkhorn, and Richland wells, of which the true underground temperatures are uncertain, there is a fair degree of accordance in the rates indicated by the Prairie du Chien, Berlin, Marinette, Genoa, De Soto, and Oconto wells. Owing, however, to some uncertainty as to the precise source of water, the figures can be regarded only as approximations. The temperature of the flow from relatively shallow wells at Durand indicates a high rate.
GEOLOGIC RELATIONS.
The wells in the above list are all in-the Paleozoic rocks on the slope of the low structural dome whose summit is in the broad area of crystalline rocks that occupies the northern part of the State. There are no local disturbances of any note. All the wells draw from sandstone, either the St. Peter sandstone, as at Oconto and Sheboygan, or the Upper Cambrian, some distance below the St. Peter horizon. At Marinette the granite "bedrock'' is reached at a depth of 712 feet, and at Richland at 665 feet. At Durand it is

not far below the bottom of the 200-foot well. At Sheboygan a hole 1,782 feet deep did not reach the bedrock. There is no apparent relation between the gradients and geologic conditions-.

WYOMING.
The deep-well temperatures in Wyoming given in the following table were carefully determined with Darton thermometers sunk to the bottom of the holes by my assistants or myself.
