INTRODUCTION
The rock formations of the earth are great natural underground reservoirs In which a part of the water derived from rain and snow Is stored to supply the wells and springs and to maintain the flow of the streams during periods of fair weather. The water levels in wells register the stages of these natural reservoirs; they show to what extent the water supplies are depleted by drought or by heavy pumping f.or public waterworks, Irrigation, or Industrial uses and to what extent they are replenished In seasons of abundant rainfall. The pressures recorded on flowing wells also Indicate the extent of depletion or replenishment of the artesian reservoirs.
The present report Is the second of an annual series on ground-water levels and artesian pressure, the first of which was published as WaterSupply Paper 777. This series of reports will in a sense be an inventory, year by year, of the water supplies of the parts of the country which It covers. The present report gives records of water levels or artesian pressure In observation wells In 28 States and the Territory of Hawaii that were obtained by the United States Geological Survey and cooperating Federal, State, Territorial, county, and local agencies. The complete records of water levels for several projects are given in this report, Including those for years prior to 1936. Nearly all the periodic measurements made by the Geological Survey and cooperating parties in Nebraska, Pennsylvania, and Utah, and in eight areas of the Soil Conservation Service are given In this volume. Complete records for selected wells In other States are also included. If complete descriptions of the wells are given In Water-Supply Paper 777, the well numbers only or these numbers and brief identifying descriptions are given In this report.
In most States for which records are given in this report the observation wells are not systematically distributed in accordance with a State-wide program but are the wells used in specific Investigations of certain areas, largely areas of heavy pumping. In Indiana, Nebraska, Pennsylvania, and Utah systematic State-wide programs are being carried on, but even parts of these States contain very few observation wells.

2 WATER LEVELS AND ARTESIAN PRESSURE, 1936
It is planned that as opportunity is afforded and cooperation is obtained, the project will be developed into a systematic Nation-wide program that will provide reliable and continuing basic data on the ground-water levels and artesian pressures of all the principal water-bearing formations.
The water levels in this report are given with reference to datum planes of different kinds. Some are given in depths below the measuring point that is, below the recognized reference mark, at or near the top of the well, from which the depth to the water level in the well is usually measured; some are given in height above mean sea level} and some are given in height above an assumed datum plane. On some of the observation wells the measuring points were changed in 1936, and therefore the records are not directly comparable with those in Water-Supply Paper 777, but such changes are recorded in this report. Water levels given in heights above sea level or above assumed datum planes generally are comparable with those given in Water-Supply Paper 777.

Ricker, and Miss Jane Daniel, who typed the offset copy; and to Bernard H. Lane and A. W. Harkneas, who edited the report.

ARKANSAS
GRAND PRAIRIE REGION
By David G. Thompson
Measurements of the depth to water level in wells in the Grand Prairie region, comprising Arkansas County and parts of Lonoke and Prairie Counties, Ark., Were continued in 1936 by the United States Geological Survey in cooperation with the Arkansas Agricultural Experiment Station. It had been necessary to discontinue formal financial cooperation during the greater part of the economic depression, but such cooperation was resumed on a small scale in 1936. In accordance with the cooperative arrangement, the measurements of water level were made by employees of the Arkansas Agricultural Experiment Station, under the general direction of Prof. Deane G. Carter and the immediate direction of G. H. Banks.
In 1936 some expansion of the well-measurement program was undertaken. In the spring, between March 3 and May 5, 238 wells were measured, of which 120 were wells that had been measured under the regular program in earlier years and 118 were new wells. A somewhat smaller number of wells were measured once in September. An automatic water-stage recorder was maintained on one well throughout the year. There is now available an automatic record for this well for about 8^ years. Because of limitations of finances and personnel it was necessary to make many of the spring measurements on dates considerably different from those u'sed in the spring of 1935. Accordingly, these measurements cannot be strictly compared with those of the previous year.
The significant facts in regard to the geologic arid hydrologic conditions in the Grand Prairie region w'ere described briefly in Water-Supply Paper 777. It is desirable here to mention only certain facts.
In most wells that have been measured, particularly those in the central part of the region, the water level has dropped to successively lower levels nearly every year. The measurements in the spring of 1936 showed that this downward trend had continued in many wells during the pumping season of 1935. Unfortunately, funds were not available for measurements in the fall of 1935, and therefore there is no basis for comparison with the measurements in the fall of 1936 in the region as a whole. However, in well 280, the only well equipped with a recorder, the water dropped, in August 1936, to a level about 1.20 feet lower than the
3

4 WATER LEVELS AND ARTESIAN PRESSURE, 1936
lowest level reached in 1935; and on May 1, 1937, the water level was
about 1.50 feet lower than on May 4, 1936.
It is desirable to emphasize the fact that the water levels in all
observation wells in the Grand Prairie region show fluctuations of more
than 1 foot within a few days and as much as 0.80 foot in 24 hours, these
fluctuations being caused by fluctuations of atmospheric pressure. The
water level tends to go down when the atmospheric pressure increases and
to rise when the atmospheric pressure decreases. The greatest differ-
ences are due to the passage of areas of high and low pressure that is,
conditions that produce fair and stormy weather respectively. In order
to make accurate comparison of the water level on corresponding days in
different years it is necessary to correct for the atmospheric fluctua-
tions by comparison with a barograph record at some meteorologic station,
the nearest of which is the United States Weather Bureau station at
Little Rock. For this purpose the record of well 280 here reported
gives the time of observation.
There are given below the records for well 280, on which a recorder
has been maintained, and for 15 other wells that were measured once or
twice during'1936 and the earlier records of which were published in
Water-Supply Paper 777. Two of the wells (Nos. 51A and 173) for which
1935 records are given in Water-Supply Paper 777, were not measured in
1936. The well numbers used in the tabulation below are the same as
those used in that publication. All records give the depth to water
level, in feet, below the measuring points described in Water-Supply
Paper 777.

280. Fred Hedrick. NW-iNWi sec. 3, T. 3 S., R. 5 W. This well is equipped with an automatic water-stage recorder. In Water-Supply' Paper 777 monthly measurements of this well from July 20, 1928, to December 29, 1935, were given. For the year 1936 the depths to water whenever the recorder charts were changed, usually at weekly intervals, are given below. In Water-Supply Paper 777 the measuring point was given as top of pit, level with land surface. On February 27, 1937, the observer sent in a note stating that for the last 2 years or more, measurements had been made from the top edge of a 2- by 4-inch board, 0.30 foot above the top of the well pit, which was the original measuring point. On the date just indicated the use of the original measuring point was resumed. No information in regard to this change had been noted previously and it has not been possible to determine just when the change was made. Because of the inability to determine just when the change was made the measurements have not been corrected accordingly,, When using the record for comparing the depth to water on corresponding dates in different years it must be remembered that the depths given for 2 years or more prior to February 27, 1937, may be 0.30 foot too great. The highest water level in this well during 1936 was 86.1 feet on April 15. This high level apparently was reached during a period of unusual low pressure, and the normal level

was probably 0.30 to 0.50 foot lower. The lowest level during the year was about 93.65 feet on August 21. In comparison, the highest level in
1935 was about 85.10 feet on April 6; and the lowest level was 92.46 feet on August 30.

GENERAL SUMMARY
By P. C. Ebert
During 1936 the United States Geological Survey maintained a waterstage recorder on -well 42a, at Baldwin Park, in the upper San Gabriel Valley, and made at least two measurements of the depths to water level In 19 of Its observation wells In the upper San Bernardlno Basin. Measurements of depths to water level were made twice during the year in 90 observation wells In the Mojave River Valley, In 18 wells In the Antelope Valley, and In 10 wells In the San Jaolnto area. Other observation wells In the south coastal basins were not visited, because measurements were made at frequent Intervals by other public agencies.
The California Water & Telephone Co., San Diego Bay division, Coronado district, a permittee of the State Division of Water Rights, measured In 1936 the depths to water level In 19 wells In San Diego County. The Department of Public Works, Division of Water Resources, collected from various Interested parties records of water level in 2,400 wells In the south coastal basins and will publish the records of about one-third of them In Its annual report. During the year the Department published Its annual report, Bulletin 39d, which contains hydrologic data collected during 1935. The Los Angeles Department of Water and Power made monthly measurements In 40 wells In Bouquet Canyon In 1936 and the Water Department of the City of Santa Barbara made monthly measurements of depths to water level In representative wells In the Santa Ynez River Basin, Santa Barbara County. Regular measurements were continued in representative wells In Ventura County by the Ventura County Water Survey. The Midlands County Gas & Electric Co. made measurements In 16 wells In Santa Maria Valley during August 1936. Yearly measurements have been made In these wells since 1929. The county surveyor made spring and fall measurements In about 170 wells In the Sallnas Valley, which constitute a continuation of the observations begun by the State engineer In 1932. About 200 wells In the Santa Clara Valley were measured about twice a month by the Santa Clara Valley Water Conservation District and about 200 wells In the Sacramento Valley were measured during the fall by the State engineer. The State engineer in 1936 also measured the depths to water level In 180 wells In Madera

County, 500 wells in Presno County, 400 wells in Kings County, 1,200 wells in Tulare County, and 340 wells in Kern County. The Los Angeles Department of Water and Power maintained water-stage recorders on 46 wells in the Owens Valley and measured the depths to water level in 177 deep wells and 60 test holes twice monthly. Three wells in Haiwee Valley were measured weekly, and four other wells were measured monthly. Nineteen wells in the Mono Basin were measured monthly.
Graphs showing fluctuations of water level in four typical wells in southern California the Williams well, in San Bernardino Valley; well 41, near Anaheim, in the coastal plain of southern California; well 42, at Baldwin Park, in the foothill belt between Los Angeles and San Bernardino; and well 72, at Perris, in San Jacinto Valley. .were published in Water-Supply Paper 468, in 1921. Measurements of water level made in these wells, or in comparable companion wells, since 1920 are given in the following pages.

MOKELUMNE AREA
By Arthur M. Piper
The program of water-level measurements in wells in the Mokelumne area, Calif., was continued in 1936 by the East Bay Municipal Utility District and the Pacific Gas & Electric Co. Records of water levels in 1935 in 24 selected observation wells in the area were published in Water-Supply Paper 777, pages 27-34. Measurements of water level made in these wells by the two agencies in 1936 appear in the following pages. The water levels are given in feet above mean sea level. To avoid confusion resulting from changes in measuring points each measuring point has been assigned a number, such as (l) or (2), which appears with the description of the point. The altitudes of the measuring points were determined from spirit leveling by the United States Geological Survey and the East Bay Municipal Utility District. The datum is mean sea level, general adjustment of 1929.
A comparison between the stages of the water levels in the wells on several dates in 1936 with stages on corresponding dates in 1935 is given in the following table.

Net annual change in ground-water level, in feet above (+) or below (-) the level on corresponding dates in 1935, in 24 wells in the Mokelumne area, California

COLORADO
SAN LUIS VALLEY
By T. W. Robinson
The San Luis Valley, in south-central Colorado, is a long, flat depressional valley with high mountain ranges on the east and west. The altitude of the valley floor is more than 7,500 feet at most places. Both unconfined shallow ground water and artesian water occur in the valley fill. Over most of the valley floor the shallow ground water can be obtained within 15 feet of the surface, and artesian water within 50 to 250 feet. On the alluvial slopes of the valley the depth to the shallow ground water may exceed 100 feet. Development of the artesian water began about 1880, and at the present time there are over 6,000 flowing wells in the valley.
The first measurements of artesian pressure were made by Professor I/
Carpenter, -of the Colorado Agricultural College, in 1891. In 1904
£/
Siebenthal made a few measurements of artesian pressure. The first extensive measurements of water levels of the shallow ground water were made
5/ in the period April 20, 1912, to April 30, 1915, by S1;annard and Miller in 32 wells in the vicinity of Mosca, north of the Rio Grande. The depth to water level in an unknown number of shallow wells was also measured during part of this period in the Carmel drainage district, south of the Rio Grande. These measurements were made in connection with the construction of drainage ditches.
In the spring and summer of 1931 the State engineer of Colorado bpred 127 observation wells to the shallow ground water in the trough of of the Closed Basin area, north of the Rio Grande. The depth to water level in these wells was measured periodically during the spring, summer, and fall of 1931 and 1932. Later in the summer and fall of 1931 the State engineer of New Mexico bored 126 observation wells to the shallow ground water in the Closed Basin area. Measurements of depths to water level in these wells were made at irregular intervals from November 1931, to November 1935. Altitudes of the measuring points of the wells were

established by spirit leveling carried on by the State engineers of Colorado and New Mexico.
Beginning in March 1936, the United States Geological Survey, in connection with the Rio Grande Joint Investigation, established 341 observation wells in the valley. This number includes 22 artesian wells, one of which waa equipped with an automatic water-stage recorder for 3 months. The observation wells for the shallow ground water were divided into two groups, one consisting of 245 wells in the -Closed Basin area north of the Rio Grande, and the ather consisting of 74 wells south of the Rio Grande. Included in the group of wells in the Closed Basin area were 24 of the wells bored by the State engineer of Colorado and 125 of the wells bored by the State engineer of New Mexico. The remaining 96 wells were established by the United States Geological Survey in the spring of 1936. Measurements of water levels in the wells were made about monthly until December 1936. Three of the wells were equipped with automatic water-stage recorders for short periods during the growing season.
The water level in the artesian wells was observed to rise in the spring and decline in the fall in response to irrigation. The maximum fluctuation recorded in 1936 amounted to 3.07 feet.
The water level in the shallow wells was found to fluctuate in response to irrigation, rainfall penetration, pumping, and transpiration draft. Fluctuations caused by irrigation were largest; the maximum fluctuation observed in 1936 amounting to 8.5 feet. Fluctuations of the water table in response to rainfall penetration varied with the intensity of individual storms. A rise of the water table of more than 1.85 feet was observed in one well that was equipped with a water-stage recorder in the period July 27 to August 6, 1936, when the rainfall amounted to 2.54 inches. A reconnaissance of the pumping plants used for irrigation during the summer of 1936 showed that there were 176 in the valley. As these plants are used only when there is a shortage of surface water for irrigation, fluctuations, of the water level due to pumping occur chiefly during years of low run-off. The water table, as the result of transpiration draft, declines progressively throughout the growing season except in the irrigated areas. In July 1936 the water table stood 5 feet or less below the land surface in approximately 70 percent of the valley, and from 5 to 8 feet in approximately 20 percent. Hence conditions nearly everywhere in the valley are favorable for the use of ground water by plants.

It is contemplated that all the water-level measurements made since 1931 will be published in the report of the Rio Grande Joint Investigation under the auspices of the National Resources Committee. No provision has been made at this time for future measurements.

All measurements of depth to water level after March 13, 1936, were made by the United States Geological Survey. Measurements prior to that date were made by the State engineer of Colorado or of New Mexico, as indicated by the name of the State and the State well number in parentheses following the well number used in this report. Altitudes refer to sea-level datum, general adjustment of 1929.

FLORIDA
By V. T. Stringfield
Measurements of water levels in wells in Florida were continued in 1936 in connection with the cooperative ground-water investigation by the Florida Geological Survey, Herman Gunter, State geologist, and the United States Geological Survey. A brief description of the projects and the availability of measurements prior to 1936 is given on pages 40 to 42 of Water-Supply Paper 777.
During 1936 the pressure head on an artesian well and the water level in a sinkhole or natural well in Marion County, together with water levels in four wells in Leon County, were measured at more or less regular intervals. Measurements in Marion County were made by D. S. Wallace, district engineer, or his assistants. Three of the wells in Leon County were measured by F. C. Westendick about twice each month, and one of the wells was measured daily by the Tallahassee Water Department-. A description of the observation wells in Marion County and all the measurements on these wells to the end of 1936 are included on the following pages. The measurements on the wells in Leon County, together with measurements made by F. C. Westendick or the writer on about 50 wells in Florida west of the Suwannee River, will be included in a report now being prepared on that area.
An automatic water-level recorder on an artesian well near Sarasota, Sarasota County, and an automatic pressure recorder on an artesian well In Jacksonville, Duval County, have been in operation since 1930. Acknowledgments are due to the Palmer Corporation for changing the charts on the recorder at Sarasota and to the Jacksonville Water Department for changing the charts on the recorder in Jacksonville.
Marion County Sharpes Ferry well, drilled by U. S. Engineer Department. It is designated as Marion County 5 in United States Geological Survey WaterSupply Paper 773-C. The well is on the west side of the Oklawaha River and the north side of the road that crosses the river at Sharpes Ferry, about 8 miles east of Ocala, in sec. 11, T. 15 S., R. 23 E. Diameter 6 inches, depth 135 feet, cased 135 feet. Measuring point, top of 6-inch casing, 42.53 feet above mean sea level and about 3 feet above the land surface at the well. Yields artesian water from the Ocala limestone. 32

This well is in one of the artesian areas that will be affected considerably with a permanent loss of artesian head if the trans-Plorida ship canal is completed. The fluctuation of the pressure head in this well is similar to the fluctuation of water levels in wells in an area to the west where the Ocala limestone is present at or near the surface and where water enters that formation. Also the fluctuations are somewhat similar to those in the Blue Grotto near Bellview, which is described and for which measurements are given on one of the following pages. This similarity is to be expected because the Blue Grotto apparently extends in depth to the Ocala limestone. The range of the fluctuation of the Sharpes Perry well was about 8 feet during the period from January 1933 to the end of 1936. The pressures show a very close relationship to the rainfall, being highest during or after periods of relatively heavy rains.

By H. T. Stearns

Island of Palm

During 1936 the United States Geological Survey made 223 monthly measurements of the water level in 19 wells on the island of Oahu. The Honolulu Board of Water Supply made a total of 249 measurements on 113 wells, of which 107 were measured more than once, and the Board maintained automatic water-stage recorders on 11 wells. Measurements of water level in well 276, which are included in this report, were furnished by the Ewa Plantation Co. This well is in artesian area 11, on the southeast shore of the Waianae Range. Records are now available for all 12 artesian areas for the first time since systematic measurements began in 1910.
The water level was higher in 9 areas and lower in 2 areas at the end of the year than at the beginning. The following table, which is essentially a continuation of the table on page 47 of Water-Supply Paper 777, indicates that there was a loss in ground-water storage in area 1, but a gain in areas 2 and 3 of the 3 areas pumped by the Honolulu Board of Water Supply. A gain in storage occurred in all but one of the larger areas pumped by sugar plantations. The large gain of 1.52 feet in the Pearl Harbor area, which is pumped at the average rate of about 150,000,000 gallons a day, represents an important increase in groundwater storage.

36 WATER LEVELS AND ARTESIAN PRESSURE, 1936

In the following records the head of the water in the wells is expressed in feet with reference to mean sea level. In some of the wells this is the water level in the well as measured; in others it is the height to which the water would rise in a water-tight casing or tube, as indicated by the shut-in pressure.

Island of Maul
Maui consists of two mountains of volcanic origin connected by a flat strip of land known as the Isthmus, on which a number of Maui-type wells or shafts to the basal water table are located. The largest yields 40,000,000 gallons a day with a draw-down of only 2.5 feet. The water is used to irrigate two sugar plantations whenever their supply of gravity ditch water is insufficient.
The year 1936 was an excellent water year for Maui. The East Maui Irrigation Co., which transports the flow of most of the streams on the north side of East Maui to the Isthmus for irrigation of the lands of the Maui Agricultural Co., and the Hawaiian Commercial & Sugar Co., delivered in 1936 the greatest quantity of water since 1879, when it was

40 WATER LEVELS AND ARTESIAN PRESSURE, 1936
founded. This does not mean that 1936 was the wettest year since 1879, because the number and capacity of the ditches have been increased since 1879. But it is important because a considerable part of this water doubtless percolates to the water table under bhese two plantations. Furthermore, during a season of high ditch deliveries less water is pumped from the wells. Thus, high ditch deliveries directly cause a higher water table under these plantations by decreasing pumpage and increasing recharge. Usually a wet year in the ditch region also means a wet year on the Isthmus. There are two sugar plantations on West Maui those of the Wailuku Sugar Co. and the Pioneer Mill Co. Only the Pioneer pumps ground water.
The pumping season of 1935 of the Maui Agricultural Co. did not close until February 28, 1936, whereas so much rain fell in the winter of 1936 that the pumping season of 1936 closed on November 5, 1936. Comparative records of the static level from year to year are difficult to obtain on this plantation, because the date of closing down the pumps is so variable. H. J. Eby, pump engineer, reports that the salt content was considerably improved at the Lower Paia well at the end of 1936 as compared with the end of 1935. On September 6, 1935, with the pumps at this well delivering about 26,000,000 gallons a day, the water level was 0.63 foot} on September 4, 1936, when pumping at practically the same rate, the level was 1 foot above mean sea level. Some of this difference in static level may be a tidal effect, because the water level rises and falls a few inches a day with the tides. The static level varies only a few inches under this plantation from year to year, the chief result of a wet year being a freshening of the water.
The water level in the Hawaiian Commercial & Sugar Co.'s wells was 2 to 3 inches higher at the end of 1936 than at the end of 1935.
As shown in the following table a net gain in the water level occurred in all the wells of the Pioneer Mill Co., even though its lands lie on the lee or dry side of the West Maui Mountains. This company, however, also irrigates with water from surface streams which head in the rain belt, hence abundant rain in the mountains increases their recharge and decreases their pumpage.

Island of Lanai
The diacharge for September 1936 of lower Maunalei tunnel, which ia fed by high-level ground water and which suppliea Lanai City, waa the loweat monthly flow aince the recorda were started in 1926. Waterlevel measurements are available for Lanai for the firat time, owing to a Maui-type well having been completed in 1936. This well, at an altitude of 294 feet and 2 miles from the coast in Maunalei Canyon, ia a 30° inclined ahaft 582 feet long. It encountered water at an altitude of 2.44 feet and ia entirely in Lanai baaalt. Extending aoutheaatward from the bottom of the ahaft ia an infiltration tunnel 536 feet long, with ita floor at altitude 1.4 feet. The water will be lifted about 1,300 feet to aupply Lanai City. About 21,000,000 gallona waa pumped from thia well between September 22 and December 31, 1936, and the daily rate ranged from 100 to 300 gallons a minute. The pump was shut down 4 to 12 hours each day. Readings are made on a ataff gage with its zero point at 2.40 feet above sea level and are furniahed by the Hawaiian Pineapple Co. The water level when the pump waa not running ranged from 2.40 feet above sea level on October 31 to 2.48 feet on November 12, 1936. Thia slight rise waa cauaed by heavy rains about November 1. Tidal effects are apparently less than 0.02 foot.

Island of Hawaii
Water-level measurements are now available at the new Maul-type well which is at an altitude of.220 feet about 3 miles from the coast, on the slope of Mauna Loa Volcano at Olaa, Hawaii. Prior to the excavation of the shaft two wells drilled about 1904 to a depth of 450 feet and equipped with air-lift pumps supplied the water. The shaft is entirely in basalt and is 10 feet in diameter, 203.5 feet deep, and 700 feet from the drilled wells. A tunnel 12 feet long connects the bottom of the shaft with the pump chamber, which is 25 feet square. In it are three pumping units of 3,500,000-, 1,500,000- and 500,000-gallon capacity. They draw from a pump sump 24 feet long and 8 feet wide, with its floor at an altitude of 2 feet. Two 3- by 6-foot tunnels 9 feet long are at one end of the sump, and a tunnel 8 feet wide and 30 feet long is at the other end. The water is used to supply the mill of the Olaa Sugar Co,, Ltd., when the flume supply is low. Water was pumped only during 2 weeks in January 1936; hence the measurements below indicate fluctuations due to natural causes. A diurnal fluctuation of 1 inch occurs, perhaps owing to changes in barometric pressure. The highest water level ever recorded in the drilled wells was at an altitude of 16.5 feet but they were not measured frequently. The maximum in the new shaft was 20.48 feet on the night of January 1, 1937, at the end of several weeks of exceptionally heavy rain.
The following records are weekly averages of two measurements made daily from the mill floor, which is at an altitude of 220 feet. All the data used herein were furnished by George Duncan, chief engineer of the Olaa Sugar Co.

By V. T. Stringfield
Periodic measurements of water levels in selected observation wells in the northern half of Indiana were begun in 1935 as a cooperative program between the Division of Geology of the Indiana Department of Conservation, W. N. Logan, State geologist, and the United States Geological
!/
Survey. The work was done by R. C. Cady, of the Federal Survey, and J. P. Kerr, assistant State geologist. Soon after the beginning of the project Professor Logan retired, and the position of assistant State geologist became vacant through the untimely death of Mr. Kerr. The cooperative program was continued in 1936 with Ralph, E. Esarey, the new State geologist. The writer, accompanied part of the time by W. H. Cordell, of the Indiana Survey, spent about 2 weeks in the field during the later part of November 1936, coordinating the work started in 1935, The measurements made during 1935 and 1936 on 43 wella, together with a description of the wells and some discussion of the water-level fluctuations, are included in the following pages. It appeared desirable to extend the program throughout the State, and during the first part of December 1936 M. M. Fidlar, of the State Survey, and the writer located 25 wells in the southern half of the State, of which 22 are on State property, and made arrangements to have water-level measurements made in them. At the end of 1936 measurements were being made about twice each month in 71 wells in 33 counties fairly well distributed over the State. These include 46 of the wells that were selected in 1935. Most of these wells represent shallow water-table conditions in glacial drift and are less than 50 feet deep. Some of them are somewhat deeper and penetrate consolidated rocks. A few of the wells are artesian. The measurements are made by members of the Civilian Conservation Corps, the Division of State Parks, and municipal water departments.

Boone 3. Industrial Land Co. of Indianapolis, corner of old power station of Indiana Electric Railroad Co., Lebanon. Diameter 8 inches, depth 230 feet. Measuring point, top of tile over well, about 0.5 foot above land surface.
Water-level measurements in wells 1, 2 and 3, Boone County, were made by C. R. Brown, technical foreman, C. C. C. camp, D-7, Lebanon.
The trends of water-level fluctuations in these wells show some similarity to each other, although well 3 is reported to be 230 feet deep and penetrates bedrock, whereas wells 1 and 2 are less than 25 feet deep and yield water from glacial drift. The trends in general show seasonal changes consisting of a gradual rise of the water level during autumn and winter and a decline during spring and summer. In well 1 the water rose about 7 feet from October 1935 to April 1936 and declined about 10 feet from May to September, reaching its lowest level for the period in September 1936. In well 2 the water level rose about 4.5 feet from October 1935 to March 1936. Prom March to September the water level declined about 6 feet, reaching its lowest level in September. The water in well 3 rose about 7.5 feet from October 1935 to February 1936, reaching its maximum stage in February, about a month before well 2 reached a maximum and about 2 months before well 1 reached its maximum level.

TARKIO CREEK AREA OP SOIL CONSERVATION SERVICE
By V. C. Fishel and G. A. LaRocque
I/ The observation well program in the Tarkio Creek area was continued in 1936 by the United States Geological Survey in cooperation with the Soil Conservation Service through P. C. Weichmann, project manager. Measurements were made in 16 wells about weekly during the year. A water-stage recorder was operated continuously on well 1, and another recorder was operated on other wells for short periods. Wells 1 and 2 were measured by a member of the Geological Survey, and the other wells were measured by members of the Soil Conservation Service. Approximately 800 measurements were made during the year ending December 31, 1936. The measuring of well 8, whose record in 1935 appears in WaterSupply Paper 777, was discontinued in 1936. Wells 4 and 13, which are used for watering stock, are included in this report, but they are not used in computing average water levels. The average water levels given in the following table are not a continuation of those given in WaterSupply Paper 777 because well 8 has been stricken from the list of wells used in computing the averages. The recomputed averages for 1934-35 are given in the following table. All water-level measurements made since the beginning of the program except those of well 8 are given in this report, including the monthly measurements that were reported in WaterSupply Paper 777. The water levels in the observation wells declined gradually during the very dry spring and summer of 1934, and in September and October they stood an average of about 1 foot lower than in May. Moderately abundant rains in the fall of 1934 produced some ground-water recharge, and at the end of the year the average of the water levels in the wells was nearly the same as in May, when measurements were begun. Very little rain or snow fell during the 5 months from December 1, 1934, to April 30, 1935, and the water levels remained nearly stationary. Heavy rainfall occurred in May and June 1935. Although in these months vegetation usually consumes considerable moisture that is stored in the soil and in the zone of saturation, the recharge was sufficient in May and June to cause the water table to rise by about the first of July to an

average stage 4 feet higher than its winter stage. During the remainder of the growing season the precipitation was moderate and the water levels declined an average of slightly more than 2 feet. The water table remained nearly stationary during November and December 1935 and declined only moderately in January 1936.
A thaw occurred during February 1936, during which time very few measurements were made because of bad roads. However, from January 28 to March 10 the water levels in the wells rose an average of nearly 4 feet. The water levels then declined until April 22, when rainfall caused them to rise sharply. On May 12 the highest average stage in the period of record was reached 4.50 feet higher than on January 28, 1936, and nearly 6 feet higher than at the beginning of observations in the spring of 1934 or on January 1, 1935. The water levels then declined, with very few interruptions, for the remainder of 1936, which was characterized by drought. They reached an average stage on December 30, 1936, that was only about 0.6 foot higher than the average stage on January 1, 1935. Moderately heavy rains occurred in September, but very little water was added to the zone of saturation, because most of the water that seeped into the ground was consumed in supplying the deficit of soil moisture.

LIMESTONE CREEK AREA OF SOIL CONSERVATION SERVICE
By V. C. Fishel and L. C. Crawford
The observation well program in the Limestone Greek area, Jewell
!/
County, Kans., was continued in 1936 by the United States Geological Survey in cooperation with the Soil Conservation Service through. R. P. Ramsey, project manager. Weekly measurements of water level were made in 40 wells, making a total of about 2,000 measurements during 1936. Automatic water-stage recorders were operated on 4 of the wells. The measurements were made by members of the Soil Conservation Service and the Geological Survey.
Monthly measurements of water level in 24 wells (2, 2a, 4, 6, 8, 12, 14, 16, 18, 22, 24, 25, 27, 28, 30, 31, 40, 41, 42, 44, 45, 48, 49, and 50) are given in Water-Supply Paper 777, and the measurements in all of these wells were used in computing the average water levels given in that report. Weekly water-level measurements in 40 wells are given in the present report, including the monthly measurements in all the wells that were included in Water-Supply Paper 777, except those in wells 2a, 16, 24, 2*7, and 31, as these wells have been discontinued. The measurements in 17 wells (2, 6, 8, 10, 12, 18, 22, 25, 28, 30, 40, 41, 42, 45, 48, 49, and 50) were used in computing the average water levels given in this report. The measurements given for wells 4, 14, 43, 44, 46, and 47 were not used in computing the averages because some of these wells were affected by pumping and in others the water-level fluctuations were somewhat erratic. Measurements in 13 wells (51 to 63, inclusive) near a pond on the L, C. Beeler farm, northwest of Ionia, and 4 wells (34, 34a, 34b, and 34c) near a pond on the farm of Glen Kindler, near Esbon, are also included in this report.
There appears to be a close correlation in this area between the water levels in the wells and the precipitation. The water levels decline during periods of light precipitation and rise during periods of moderate or heavy precipitation. The precipitation was considerably below normal from March 1934 to April 1935, and aa a result the water levels in the wells declined persistently with minor exceptions from

the time the initial measurements were made in March, April, or May 1934, until the middle of May 1935. Heavy rains, amounting to 9.36 inches in May and 6.24 inches in June, caused an abrupt rise of the water levels that averaged 2.0 feet from May 20 to July 4. There was only 0.39 inch of rainfall in July and practically no rain during the first half of August, which resulted in a gradual decline of the water levels during this period. The rainfall in August amounted to 7.20 inches, practically all of which fell in the last half of the month, and about 2 inches of rain fell in the first part of September. As a result of this rainfall the water levels rose an average of about 1.5 feet. Light rainfall during the later part of September and October was accompanied by an average decline of about 0.5 foot in the water levels. The water levels gradually rose after the end of the growing season although rainfall was light, and the average water level in the wells at the end of 1935 stood about 3.75 feet higher than at the beginning of the year, and about 2 feet higher than in the spring of 1934, when observations were begun.
There was very little change in stage of the water levels from January to April 1936. A small decline occurred during April, but this decline was followed by a rise of about 0.3 foot that carried the water levels on May 15 to the highest average stage observed during the period of record. The water levels then declined about 2.5 feet by October 1, changed only slightly during October, November, and December, and on December 31 stood 2.36 feet lower than on January 1, 1936, 1.49 feet higher than on January 1, 1935, and about 1 foot higher than the average stage when measurements were begun.

Beeler Pond wells
Thirteen wells (51 to 63)surround a pond on the L. C. Beeler farm northwest of Ionia. Six wells (52 to 57) are located along an east-west line about 75 feet above the dam. Well 54 ia near the east edge of the pond; wells 53 and 52 are 50 and 100 feet, respectively, east of 54j well 55 is near the west edge of the pond; and wells 56 and 57 are 50 and 100 feet, respectively, west of 55. Well 58 is 125 feet north of 57, well 60 is 110 feet north of 52, and well 59 is about 100 feet north on a line that bisects perpendicularly the line connecting wells 58 and 60. Well 51 is 65 feet south of the overflow, well 61 is 210 feet south and thence 250 feet east of well 51, well 63 is 210 feet south and thence 90 feet west of well 51, and well 62 is 400 feet south and thence 110 feet east of well 51.

64 WATER LEVELS AND ARTESIAN PRESSURE, 1936
Weekly measurements have been made on these wells since September 1934. Well 51 is equipped with an automatic water-stage recorder. The water levels are expressed in relation to the zero level of a staff gage, to which was assigned an arbitrary height of 100 feet.
The water level of the pond stood at a higher stage at the beginning of the measurements than the water levels in any of the wells and maintained a higher stage until the middle of August 1936. At this time the water level in well 59 rose to a higher stage than the pond level and remained slightly higher until October. Although the water level in the well decline.d below the level of the pond in October, there were times in November and December when the water level in the well rose above the pond level.
Prom the beginning of the measurements until December 15, 1934, the water table sloped away from the pond to the west, as indicated by the water levels in wells 55, 56, and 57. However, the slope of the water table away from the pond along this line of wells gradually decreased until on January 12, 1935, the gradient was reversed, and the water table sloped from well 57 to well 55. However, the pond level at this time still was higher than the water level in well 55, hence water was apparently moving to the south out of the area in a ground-water valley between the pond and the well.
Heavy rainfall in May and June 1935 rapidly raised the pond level, after which it declined. The water level in well 55 rose until July 5 and then declined. The water level in well 56 rosfc until July 26, whereas the pond level and the water level in well 55 declined during the later part of this period. Well 57 rose until August 16. Hence, the water level in well 57 rose for six weeks after July 5, during which time the water level in well 55 was declining. Under conditions of equilibrium there is a rather definite relation between the water level in the pond and nearby wells. The water level in the pond is generally about 4.5 feet higher than the water level in well 55. When the difference in stage between the water levels in the pond and the well becomes greater than the difference should be under conditions of equilibrium, the water level in the well rises until the two water levels are again in equilibrium, even though the pond level may be declining at the time. A similar relation holds between the stages of the water levels in wells 55 and 56 and also in wells 56 and 57.

Kindler Pond wells
Pour wells surround a pond on the farm of Glen Kindler. The pond is 2.5 miles south and thence 3.5 miles west of Esbon. Well 34 is 220 feet south of the east spillway, well 34B is 60 feet north of the east spillway, well 34A is 240 feet west and thence 70 feet south of well 34B, and well 34C is 400 feet north and thence 10 feet west of well 34A.
Measurements of the water levels were begun in well 34 in May 1934 and in the other three wells in November 1934. The water levels are expressed in relation to the zero level of the staff gage to which is given an arbitrary height of 100 feet.

MARYLAND
By M. T. Thomson
Periodic records of water levels have been obtained since April 18, 1932, on one observation well in Maryland by the United States Geological Survey in cooperation with the Maryland Geological Survey and the Maryland Department of Health. This work is under the direction of A. H. Horton, district engineer of the Geological Survey. A paper entitled "Relation of stream flow to ground-water levels", by L. L. Harrold, in the Transactions of the American Geophysical Union for 1934 is based on the records of this well.
The well ia an abandoned dug well, 20 feet deep, lined with loose stone, at the rear of P. E. Valdenar'a residence, 800 feet northeast of the gaging station on the Northwest Branch of the Anacostia River, 1^miles southweat of Coleaville, Montgomery County, Md. Prior to June 1, 1935, daily readings of water level were obtained from a tape-float gage. Since that time a continuous record of water-level fluctuations has been obtained by a weekly water-stage recorder. Measurements are given in feet above the same datum to which is referred the gage on the Northwest Branch of the Anacostia River.

MICHIGAN
By V. T. Stringfield
A program of measurements of ground-water level in Michigan was started in the fall of 1932, when the Geological Survey division of the Michigan Department of Conservation, in cooperation with the United States Geological Survey, began an investigation in Roscommon County to determine the areas in which ground water is available at depths of 20 feet or less in sufficient quantity to supply wells that may be used for checking and extinguishing forest fires.
In the .spring of 1933 this cooperative work was expanded, through the Michigan Emergency Conservation Work, to cover a large area in the northern part of the southern peninsula. During 1934 0. F. Poindexter, of the State Survey, and A. W. Bergquist, of the Michigan Emergency Conservation Work, together with V. T. Stringfield, of the Federal Survey, started a systematic program of measurements in selected observation wells that were constructed as part of the investigation. The program, which is under the direction of R. A. Smith, State Geologist, and 0. E. Meinzer, of the United States Geological Survey, is briefly described on pages- 71 to 73 of Water-Supply Paper 777. Water-level measurements were made about twice each month during 1936 by the personnel of the Michigan Emergency Conservation Work under the direct supervision of Mr. Bergquist in about 240 wells in 13 counties in the northern part of the southern peninsula of Michigan. All the wells are in glacial drift in areas unaffected by pumping and are about 10 to 30 feet deep. Most of them are 2 inches in diameter. A continuous water-stage recorder on a well near Roscommon has been in operation since 1934. The water-level fluctuations in that well, which are about typical for the area, are_ described below.
Roscommon County
The Roscommon recorder well was constructed especially for a continuous water-stage recorder and located at the Michigan Forest Fire Experiment Station headquarters about 2 miles south of Roscommon in the SW^ sec. 17, T. 24 N., R. 2 W., Roscommon County. Diameter 8 inches, depth 11.5 feet, cased 11.5 feet. Measuring point, top of 6-inch well casing, about 2.5 feet above land surface. Graphic, continuous records of the water level with natural scale are on file in the office of the
83

84 WATER LEVELS AND ARTESIAN PRESSURE, 1956
geological division of the Michigan Department of Conservation, Lansing, Mich. The measurements in the following table show the highest and lowest water level each month from November 1954 through 1956.
On November 5, 1954, when the recorder was installed, the water level was 8 feet below the top of the casing and about 5.5 feet below the land surface. The water level rose-gradually until about the middle of December, when it stood about 4.6 feet below the surface. Prom the later part of December 1954 to the first part of March 1955 the ground was frozen, so that little or no recharge to the water-bearing sand took place and thus the water level slowly declined to 5.5 feet below the surface. Prom March 5 to 27 the water level rose 1.5 feet, apparently because the thawing of the ground permitted water to percolate downward to the water-bearing sand. On March 27 the water level stood about 5.9 feet below the surface, the highest stage in 1955. It declined gradually until the later part of September, when a stage of about 5.8 feet below the surface was reached. Prom that time to February 15, 1956, the water level fluctuated very little, ranging only between the depths of 5.65 to 5.8 feet below the surface. On May 15 the water level rose to 4.4 feet below the land surface, its highest stage in 1956, and from that time it declined until about September 1, when it stood about 6 feet below the surface. The water level on December 25, 1936, stood about 0.26 foot higher than on December 18, 1955, and 0.60 foot lower than on December 51, 1954.
Fluctuations caused by temperature changes in the winter and transpiration from plants were observed during certain periods in 1956. The effects of the changes of atmospheric pressure also were reflected in fluctuations of the water level during periods when the ground was frozen. During the two-year period of record the range in the fluctuation of the water level was only 2.12 feet. The highest level was reached in March 1955, when the water level was 6.40 -feet below the top of the casing and about 3.9 feet below the surface of the ground, and the lowest level was reached in August 1956, when the water level was 8.52 feet below the top of the casing and about 6.02 feet below the surface of the ground.

FLATHEAD VALLEY BETWEEN PLATHEAD LAKE AND KALISPELL

By W. A. Lamb

The investigation of the ground-water levels in the valley and delta area between Kalispell and the head of Plathead Lake was continued in 1936. About 14 measurements were made in 45 wells during the year, making a total of about 122 measurements made since observations were begun in July, 1928. The locations and descriptions of the wells and water-level measurements in them through 1935 are given in Water-Supply Paper 777. Average monthly water levels for the period 1928 to 1936 and individual measurements made in 1936 are given in the following tables.

Average monthly water levels in the observation wells in Plathead Valley
(The average given for each month was computed from the first series of measurements made in that month and indicates height, in feet, above an arbitrary datum; 2,800 must be added to convert these averages to altitude above sea level.)

The State-wide program of water-level measurements in wells in Nebraska was continued in 1936 by the United States Geological Survey
in cooperation with the Conservation and Survey Division of the University of Nebraska. At the end of the year periodic observations of
water level were being made in 393 wells. An average of about 6 measurements were made in each of 337 wells on which observations were
begun prior to 1936, and from 1 to 5 measurements were made in 56 other wells that were incorporated in the program during the year. A total of about 2,150 individual measurements were made in 1936 in connection with the cooperative investigation.
Periodic measurements of the temperature of the water in the observation wells was begun in the summer of 1936, and it is planned to continue these observations indefinitely. The chemical character of samples of water collected from about 100 of the wells during the year was determined in the laboratory of the United Statea Geological Survey in Washington. Additional analyses will be made in 1937. The tem-
perature data and chemical analyses are not yet in form for publication.
!/
Papers on the water-bearing formations of Nebraska and the con2/
servation of land and water resources of Nebraska were published during the year by the Conservation and Survey Division of the University of Nebraska. Two articles dealing more specifically with ground-water levels in the State were published in the Transactions of the American
3/ Geophysical Union.
The precipitation in Nebraska in 1936 amounted to only about 63 percent of the normal average, and as a result the water levels in most wells declined below their corresponding stages of 1935. The water levels in some wells declined below their low stages of 1934, but these net 2-year declines generally were limited to fractions of a foot. In general, water levels in 1936 declined the least in western Nebraska and the most in the eastern part of the State. However, in southeastern
Nebraska, the water levels in most of the observation wells maintained

stages in 1936 appreciably above their low levels of 1934, and consequently the acute water shortage that existed in this part of the State in 1934 did not recur in 1936. The amount of water contained in the ground-water reservoirs in southeastern Nebraska was increased in 1935 and also in the first part of 1936 to such an extent that this storage was generally ample to supply demands during the subsequent dry summer and fall.
In the sand hills of central Nebraska water levels in many of the observation wells reached low levels in 1936, but there were no water shortages because in most places several hundred feet of saturated water-bearing material occurs below the land surface. The levels of many sand-hill lakes doubtless declined in 1936, inasmuch as the surfaces of these lakes usually represent exposed parts of the water table. There were very few significant changes in water level in the deep wells on the upland plains and tablelands. The fluctuations of water level in most of these wells have not shown a definite trend and have ranged between limits of only a foot or less since observations on them were begun in 1934.
Water levels in wells in the central Platte River Valley generally declined in 1936 to about their low levels of 1934. The following table gives average interpolated water levels in four groups of wells in the Platte Valley in 1936 and comparisons with average stages of previous years. Averages of the water levels in these wells from 1931 to 1935 are given in Water-Supply Paper 777, page 90.

An inspection of this table indicates that in three out of the four groups of wells the decline of the water level was less in 1936 than in 1934. However, the decline in 1936 exceeded the rise in 1935 in two groups and equaled it in another. Thus the water level in the first two groups reached a stage in 1936 that was lower than in 1934, and the water level in the third group declined to the same low stage. The rise in the fourth group in 1935 exceeded the decline in 1936, and hence the water level in 1936 did not drop to the low stage of 1934. The net decline in water level from January 1, 1931, to October 1, 1936, in all the groups of wells, which has been caused chiefly by deficient precipitation, indicates a general lowering of the water table over the valley of nearly the same amount.
Average water levels in 252 wells scattered throughout Nebraska are given in Water-Supply Paper 777, page 91, but it has not been found feasible to continue the averages in this report. However, records and water-level measurements of 337 wells on which periodic measurements were begun prior to 1936 are included in the following pages. All measurements made in 1936 are given, together with almost all measurements made prior to that year. Measurements made since 1930 in wells in the Platte River Valley, which includes wells in Buffalo, Dawson, Hall, Kearney, and Phelps Counties, are also given. The records of water levels in well 85, in Morrill County, were furnished by the Nebraska Department of Roads and Irrigation, and the measurements in well 3, on the Crescent Lake Bird Refuge, in Garden County, were furnished by the United States Biological Survey.
The well descriptions and measurements are listed alphabetically by county locations and by numbers within each county. Original field numbers are used. Complete records on the five wells included in WaterSupply Paper 777, page 92, are included under the proper county headings, but the numbers of these wells have been changed. Pawnee County well 1 is now well 4; Dakota County 1 is 104; Gosper County 1 is 182j Cheyenne County 2 is 84; and Lincoln County 7 is 241. The descriptions of the measuring points and the heights of the measuring points above land surface and above datum for all wells given in this report are those that existed at the end of 1936. The depth of the water level below the measuring point which is given for the first day of record is referred to the present measuring point. This includes wells on which the measuring point has been altered.

92 WATER LEVELS AND ARTESIAN PRESSURE, 1936

All water levels are expressed in feet above an assumed datum 100 feet below the water level in that well on January 1, 1935. The height of the measuring point above the datum for most wells that have been established since January 1, 1935, has been taken as the average height of the water level in a group of similar wells on some selected date. All water levels given for any one well are directly comparable, even though the altitude of the measuring point has been changed, because the records are given in heights above a datum that has been referred to one or more benchmarks near the well.

NEW JERSEY
By Henry C. Barksdale
Ground-water areas in the State
Hew Jersey contains within its boundaries parts of four of the
!/
twenty-one major ground-water provinces into which Meinzer has divided the United States.. The southeastern part of the State, considerably more than one-half of its area, lies in the Atlantic Coastal Plain province, and a large majority of the important ground-water supplies in the State are drawn from the sand and gravel of this area. Next in importance is the Northeastern Drift province, which covers the northern third of the State and in which several important ground-water supplies are found. Much smaller portions of the State lie within the Piedmont province and the Blue Ridge-Appalachian Valley province, and no very large water supplies are drawn from the rocks of these areas.
Most of the water-level measurements in New Jersey have been made in connection with quantitative ground-water investigations, carried on by the United States Geological Survey in cooperation with the New Jersey Water Policy Commission. For reasons of efficiency and economy, this work has been concentrated chiefly in six regions or areas, which are considered typical of other parts of the State or in which critical ground-water problems exist. These six areas are the Atlantic City, Camden, Asbury Park, Runyon, Canoe Brook, and East Paterson regions. The following is a brief description of the conditions in each of these regions:
Atlantic City region. The Atlantic City region lies within the Atlantic Coastal Plain province. The principal ground-water supplies are obtained from the unconsolidated sands of the Kirkwood and Cohansey formations, of Tertiary age. Practically all the wells measured in this area are artesian and are affected by heavy withdrawals of water. The fluctuations of water level in the wells in this area are caused principally by the fluctuations of pumpage from the different sands. In some wells near the shore part of the fluctuation is caused by the loading and -unloading of the surface as the tide rises and falls.

The types of daily fluctuation produced by various combinations of tidal and pumping effects are discussed and illustrated in the report on this
§/ area published during the year. For the purpose of studying the fluctuations of water level over long periods the daily fluctuations are smoothed out either by graphic methods or by computing daily averages, as is done with the record from the 14th Avenue well, Longport, for which detailed records are given later in this report.
Camden region. The Camden region is in the Atlantic Coastal Plain province. All the wells measured in this region are artesian, and all are affected by pumping. The principal ground-water supplies in this region are drawn from unconsolidated sands of the Raritan formation, of Cretaceous age. Water levels in test well 3, at the Morris station of the Camden waterworks, are given in the following pages. These water levels were obtained by means of a water-stage recorder, which has been in operation on this well since 1924. The fluctuations of water level in this well, which are sometimes wide and rapid, are caused principally by changes in the rate of pumping at this station and by changes in the distribution of the pumping among the various wells in the field, but there are also some indications of tidal effect. A hydrograph showing the lowest water level in this well each day from 1924 to 1927, together with some related factors, was published in Thompson's report on this
<^ region.
Asbury Park region. The Asbury Park region is also in the Atlantic Coastal Plain province. All the wells observed in this region are artesian, and all are affected by pumping. The principal water supplies are drawn from the sands of the Raritan, Englishtown, and Mount LaurelWenonah formatibns, which occur at depths of approximately 1,100, 600, and 450 feet, respectively. All these formations are of Cretaceous age.
Runyon region. Like the three regions described above, the Runyon region is in the Atlantic Coastal Plain province. The principal ground water supplies are derived from two members of the Raritan formation, the so-called No. 1 and No. 3 sands. Most of the wells measured are water-table wells, and a considerable number of them are not affected by heavy artificial withdrawals of water. In this region the water in the No. 1 sand is under artesian pressure, but the No. 3 sand contains water

under water-table conditions. The wells tapping the No. 1 sand are all
affected by heavy pumping and fluctuate widely and rapidly with the
changes in the rate of pumping. Most of the observation, wells in the
No. 5 sand are also affected by pumping, but the fluctuations in them
are not generally rapid. Most of the Runyon test wells are affected
by pumping. The Runyon farm wells and a few others, such as the Mor-
rell and Hulsart wells, are not affected by pumping or are affected only
by very small withdrawals of water for household use.
Canoe Brook region. The Canoe Brook region is an irregular area
north of the city of Summit and is within the Northeastern Drift provinc
The principal ground-water supplies are obtained from glacial drift, and
a few wells draw water from interbedded sandstone and shale of Triassic
age. Most of the wells measured in this area are artesian, and all of
them are affected by heavy artificial withdrawals of water. -The fluc-
tuations of water level are caused primarily by fluctuations of pump.age
and are frequently wide and rapid.
East Paterson region. The East Paterson region is also in the
Northeastern Drift province. Its principal ground-water supplies are
drawn from sandstone of Triassic age. Most of the wells in the region
are artesian, and all that have been measured are affected by pumping to
some extent. In some of them the fluctuations are wide and rapid. In
one observation well fluctuations of 25 feet in a day are not unusual.
Availability of records of water levels
Information on water levels in New Jersey has been published from
time to time since 1868. The titles of the publications in which such
information may be found are listed below. Two reports and one short
paper containing information about water levels in New Jersey, listed
below as 8, 9, and 10, were published in 1936.

C., A long-term record of waterlevel fluctuations at Plainfield, New Jersey: Am. Geophys. Union Trans. IVth Ann. Meeting, pp. 561-363, 1936. This paper describes the record of water levels in a well at the Netherwood station of the Plainfield Union Water Co., which has been measured regularly since 1891. This 44-year record is believed to be the longest continuous record of water levels in the United States, although it is by no means the earliest series of measurements.

The unpublished water-level records obtained during the Hew Jersey quantitative ground-water investigations are filed at the office of the State Water Policy Commission in Trenton. Practically all of them are available for inspection by anyone interested. Some of the more significant records from each of the regions under study have been summarized on hydrographs, which can be blueprinted for distribution.

Water-level work in 1936

A total of 5,821 measurements of water level in wells were made in New Jersey in 1936 in connection with the cooperative ground water investigation that is being carried on between the United States Geological Survey and the New Jersey State Water Policy Commission. Measurements were made at least once in 143 wells, and of this number 135 were measured more than once. Five wells were measured daily or at more frequent intervals by local observers. About 75 wells in the Runyon region were measured monthly by a local observer. The remaining wells were measured by the regular staff.
Water-stage recorders were maintained on 37 wells during the year. Of this number 34 were owned by the United States Geological Survey or by the State Water Policy Commission and 3 were owned by water companies or by private industries. Eight water-stage recorders were installed on wells during the year.
In the following tables of water-level measurements, an attempt has been made to give the record for one or more wells in each of the six principal regions under study and to give the complete record for each well reported. This has, of course, involved reporting the water-level measurements made prior to 1936 for each well. For the wells reported in Water-Supply Paper 777, the measurements made in 1935 have been repeated in order that the present record may be complete.
For most of the wells measured in New Jersey, the altitude of the reference points above mean sea level has been determined, and the altitude of the reference points at most of the remaining wells will probably be determined as the investigation proceeds. If the altitude of

172 WATER LEVELS AND ARTESIAN PRESSURE, 1936
the reference point of a well has teen determined by instrumental level-
ing, the water levels in the well are given in feet referred to mean sea
level. For those wells for which the altitude of reference point has not yet been determined, the water levels are reported in feet below the
reference point, so that they may be converted into altitudes above sea
level as soon as the altitude of the reference point has been determined-
For wells equipped with water-stage recorders it was necessary to
decide arbitrarily how much of the record to report, as it is obviously
impossible to report a continuous record in tabular form. The plan
adopted for such wells was to report monthly figures for the years prior to 1936 and weekly figures for 1936. Neither the lowest nor the high-
est water level in the period is truly representative of the behavior of
the water table or of the artesian pressure in a given basin, because
they too often represent the least or most favorable possible combina-
tion of conditions immediately surrounding the observation well and not
the average condition in the aquifer. For wells in which the waterlevel fluctuations are wide and rapid, the highest and lowest water
level for each month or week are reported without attempting to fix
upon a single representative figure. For wells in which the fluctua-
tions are small or gradual, the water level at definite times is re-
ported. On wells that have not been equipped with water-stage recorders all
measurements are reported, except when a considerable number of measurements were made on a single day, when the range, and number of measurements are given.

Fluctuations of water level in the Runyon area

About 50 of the wells in the Runyon area, most of them farm wells, have been measured more or less regularly since 1923. The average fluctuations of the water level in these wells from 1923 to date are given In the following table. There is considerable difference in depth and in altitude of the land surface between the various wells, and in order to eliminate these factors from the average, the water level in each well has been converted to an altitude above an assumed datum plane a short distance below the bottom of the well. The number of wells on which each average is based is shown in the table. The averages are, of course, most significant on those days when the largest number of wells were measured. Measuring of the farm veils was discontinued between June 1929 and September 1951. The averages reported for this period are based upon measurements in four test wells in the Perth Amboy waterworks well field at Runyon. These four wells are not entirely removed from the effects of pumping, but it is believed that they are fairly representative of the general fluctuations of the water table in the area.
The water level in the deeper wells reaches its highest and lowest levels much later than that in the shallow wells. For this reason separate averages have been computed for the shallow wells and for the deep wells. There is, of course, no definite line of demarcation in nature, but all wells less than 25 feet in depth have been arbitrarily

180 WATER LEVELS AND ARTESIAN PRESSURE, 1936
classed as shallow wells, and all wells 25 feet or more In depth, have been considered deep wells. The shallow wells respond more quickly than the deep wells to changes In precipitation and In the demands of vegetation for water. The lowest level in the shallow Wells usually occurs between July and September, when the demands of plants for water are high. The lowest water level in the deep wells usually occurs about the end of the year. The water table at the deep wells Is below the reach of most plant roots, and during the growing season, when the plants absorb most of the water that enters the ground, a deficiency In moisture is probably built up in the earth above the water table in these wells. After the demand for water by the plants Is stopped by frost, this deficiency must be made up before any water can pass through the intervening material and reach the water table at these deeper wells.

A water-stage recorder, has been maintained on the Morrell well since August, 1923. This well was dug especially for water-level observations and is not affected by artificial withdrawal of water. It is situated in a flat, almost swampy valley where the water table is usually near the land surface. It is surrounded by a heavy growth of deciduous bushes and small trees, and under favorable conditions, during the growing season, the record show? a very pronounced diurnal fluctuation,which has been attributed to the vegetal use of water in the vicinity. The following table shows the water level in the Morrell well on the first of each month in 1936 and the average water level on the same dates during the preceding years of record. It shows that the average water level in this well for 1936 as a whole was about the game as the average water level for the preceding years. However, it fluctuated considerably from the normal during the course of the year. The water level was generally below normal until some time in September, and thereafter it was considerably above normal. A similar comparison for 1935 is given in WaterSupply Paper 777, page 100.

LEA COUNTY, MIDDLE RIO GRANDE VALLEY, MIMBRES VALLEY, AND PORTALES VALLEY
By C. V. Theis
The cooperative ground-water investigations in Lea County, Mimbres
!/
Valley, Portales Valley, and the Roswell artesian basin were continued in 1936 by the United States Geological Survey and the State engineer of New Mexico. In addition, an investigation of the middle Rio Grande Valley was made in connection with the Rio Grande Joint Investigation, by the Geological Survey, in cooperation with the State engineer, tinder the sponsorship of the National Resources Committee. Periodic observations on water levels in wells are being made as parts of all these projects. Measurements of the water levels in wells in all the areas under investigation are published biennially in the reports of the State engineer. In this report are given only the records from three key wells in the Roswell artesian basin, the previous records of which were included in Water-Supply Paper 777.
The cooperative investigation in Lea County has been in progress since 1930. Over a part of the county the water table stands within 50 feet of the land surface, but most of this shallow-water area, is capped by limestone, and the water-level fluctuations are very small, amounting generally to only a few hundredths of a foot in a month. In the part of the county in which the limestone is not present and also near pumping plants the fluctuations of water level are much more pronounced. Groundwater recharge is effected by rainfall penetration and by absorption of water in ephemeral ponds in topographic depressions. There are in Lea County about 50 widely scattered wells that pump water for irrigation.
The ground-water investigation in the middle Rio Grande Valley was begun in 1936. About 950 shallow observation wells were established in the flood plain of the Rio Grande in Sandoval, Bernalillo, Valencia, and Socorro Counties. In this part of the valley irrigation is carried on chiefly by water diverted from the Rio Grande, and the water table is only a few feet below the land surface. A large part of this area is served by open drains. The measurements made in wells in 1936 show that in areas that were heavily irrigated the water levels reached their

highest stages of the year in late spring or early summer, when adjacent land was irrigated most heavily, and in areas where there was little or no irrigation the water levels reached their lowest stages in late July, August or early September, as an effect of summer evaporation and transpiration.
The investigation in the Mimbres Valley, Luna County, has been carried on for about 10 years. The valley is essentially the lowland portion of the potential drainage basin of the Mimbres River, in southwestern New Mexico. The wide bolsons of the Mimbres Valley are underlain by thick sedimentary deposits, including sand and gravel that contain considerable water, most of which is within 150 feet of the land surface. Ground-water recharge is derived principally from the flood waters of the Mimbres River, which is ephemeral in its lower course. There are about 125 irrigation wells in the valley, most of which were pumped heavily in 1936. During the year a general decline in water level occurred in the heavily pumped districts, ranging from a few hundredths of a foot to about 1.5 feet in wells on which periodic observations are being made.
The investigation in Portales Valley, Roosevelt County, has been in progress since 1931. The valley is a broad, shallow depression in the High Plains, under a large part of which the ground water is within 50 feet of the surface. About 350 irrigation wells in this valley were pumped in 1936. Recharge to the ground water is effected by rainfall penetration on the valley floor and adjacent areas on the High Plains. Observations on the water levels in wells show that in certain sandy areas abnormally large amounts of rainfall are followed by an immediate rise in the water table, but over the larger part of the valley the effects of pumping mask whatever variations in recharge that occur. Water levels declined throughout most of the valley in 1936, averaging a decline of about 0.5 foot in wells on which records are available.

ROSY/ELL ARTESIAN BASIN
By A. G. Piedler
The collection of records of the fluctuations of artesian head in three representative wells equipped with water-stage recorders in the Roswell artesian basin was continued during 1936 by the artesian-well supervisor under the supervision of the State engineer and the Pecos Valley Conservancy District. Periodic observations on other artesian wells within the area were made by the artesian well supervisor and are

196 WATER LEVELS AND ARTESIAN PRESSURE, 1936

discussed in the Biennial report of the State engineer. Periodic observations were made on a number of nonartesian wells in the shallow groundwater area in the Rio Pelix basin, west of Hagerman, where, in 1927, about 580 acres were irrigated with water obtained from shallow wells. The records for these wells for 1936 are on file in the office of the artesian-well supervisor, at Roswell.
The mean monthly water levels in the three key wells, shown in the following tables, were ascertained by averaging the mean daily water levels determined from an inspection of the recorder graph or, for days of wide fluctuations, by averaging the water level for fractional parts of a day. The mean annual water level was determined by averaging the mean monthly water levels. All records were furnished through the courtesy of Clifford G. Smith, artesian-well supervisor of the Roswell artesian basin. Records of water levels prior to 1936 are given in Water-Supply Paper 777, pages 112-113.

As in previous years, the records for all three wells indicate a major seasonal fluctuation in the artesian head and a marked response to changes in draft from wells used for irrigation and to changes in precipitation. The head in the Orchard Park and Artesia wells was definitely higher at the end of 1936 than at the beginning of the year, whereas in the Berrendo well the highest mean monthly head was in January. The mean annual head in the Berrendo well was 1.5 feet lower than the mean annual head for 1935, a decline which doubtless can be attributed to deficiency in precipitation, which in turn caused a heavy draft for irrigation. The continued moderate decline in the Berrendo area may furthermore be caused by a rather general increase in draft for all uses from wells in this general region. In the Orchard Park well the lowest monthly stage in the period of record (see Water-Supply Paper 777) was reached in August 1936, but,' largely because of the marked recovery in head during October, the mean monthly head for December 1936 was slightly higher than that in December 1935. The lowest mean monthly head in the Artesia well during 1936 was reached in August, but this head was 3.8 feet above the lowest head during the entire period of record, which occurred in August 1935. The mean monthly head was 0.9 foot higher for December 1936 than for December 1935, and the mean annual head was 1.3 feet higher in 1936 than in the preceding year.

NEW YORK
CENTRAL NEW YORK By A. W. Harrington

Periodic water-level measurements in three wells in central New York were continued in 1936 by the United States Geological Survey in cooperation with the New York Department of Conservation. The locations of the wells, together with descriptions of the measuring points and previous water-level measurements, are published in Water-Supply Paper 777, pp. 127-129.
The water level at the Shackam Brook well 1 in August 1936 declined below the bottom of the well for the first time since measurements were begun in 1933, and the water level in the Sage Brook well 2 also reached a new low stage in 1936. The water level in Cold Brook well 1 declined in September 1936 to about its 1935 low stage but did not fall below that stage. Recovery in the fall of 1936 was abrupt, and the water levels in the wells at the end of 1936 stood as high as at the end of 1935, or even higher.

200 WATER LEVELS AND ARTESIAN PRESSURE, 1936
LONG ISLAND
By R. M. Leggette
The investigation of ground-water conditions on Long Island, by the United States Geological Survey in cooperation with the New York State Water Power and Control Commission and Nassau and Suffolk Counties, was continued during 1936. At the end of the year 13 automatic water-stage recorders were in operation on observation wells, and weekly water-level measurements were being made in 30 additional observation wells. A total of about 900 individual water-level measurements were made in 1936.
A detailed report pertaining to ground-water levels on Long Island is now in preparation and will probably be published by the New York
State Water Power and Control Commission. Only a small part of the available data is therefore given in this report.
On page 125 of Water-Supply Paper 777 records of water level in New
York City test well M-183 were given. During 1936 this well became clogged, and no further water-level measurements were possible.
Ground-water levels on Long Island in general were higher at the end of 1936 than at the beginning of the year as much as 2 feet in some wells. This was doubtless in part the result of heavy precipitation during the year, for at New York City the total precipitation in 1936 was 46.33 inches, about 4.4 inches above normal. In areas of heavy pumping, however, there was a net decline of ground-water levels during
the year. On the west end of Long Island, where the water table is below sea level in an area of more than 45 square miles, the water table continued to drop as in previous years.
The following descriptions cover all wells on Long. Island for which water-level measurements are given in this report.

CROTON VALLEY
By C. E. Jacob
An investigation to determine the available ground-water supply in Croton Valley below Croton Dam was undertaken in July 1933 by the United States Geological Survey in cooperation with the City of Ossining. This investigation was conducted by D. G. Thompson, of the Geological Survey. In conjunction with this work three stream-gaging stations were established and maintained under the direction of A. W. Harrington, district engineer of the Geological Survey.
The area under consideration lies wholly within the narrow valley of the Croton River downstream from Croton Dam. Here the maximum width o'f the valley at stream level is about 500 feet. The old bedrock valley lies about 100 feet below the present river bed and is filled with unconsolidated gravel, sand, and clay.
The original program included nine observation wells (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and D2). One of these, well D2, was equipped with an' automatic water-stage recorder. Measurements of water level in these wells were made weekly, or nearly so, from August 1933 to May 1936 under the direction of E. W. Applebee, city engineer of Ossining. In a manuscript report by D. G. Thompson and A. W. Harrington, dated December 1935, it was recommended that a much more detailed investigation be made.
In July 1936 a detailed investigation was started by the United States Geological Survey in cooperation with the City of Ossining. Test wells were put down to obtain geologic and hydrologic information. Eight of these wells were drilled, 11 were jetted, and 19 were dug by hand, bringing the total number of observation wells to 47. The drilled wells, one 4 inches, and the rest 6 inches in diameter, range in depth from 62 to 93 feet and are definitely artesian. The jetted wells are all 2 inches in diameter and range in depth from 14 to 78 feet. Those penetrating to depths greater than about 30 feet are probably artesian. Of the dug wells 15 are 8 inches in diameter, 3 are 9 inches in diameter, and 1 is 36 inches in diameter. All are cased with perforated galvanized-iron casing. They range in depth from 3 to 13 feet.
The wells constructed during the investigation now in progress are located on or near property owned by the City of Ossining, about 5,000 feet downstream from Croton Dam. In the accompanying tabulation the location of these wells is referred to wsJ.1 10, which is centrally located.

206 WATER LEVELS AND ARTESIAN PRESSURE, 1936

With the exception of well 6, the original 9 wells are farther upstream and on the opposite side of the river from the Ossining property. Their location is referred to supply well 1 of the village of Crotonon-Hudson, which is 680 feet north of well 10.
At present the village of Croton-on-Hudson has three shallow supply wells", of the caisson type, connected by open-joint tile and pumped by suction. The average daily pumpage is less than 500,000 gallons. This withdrawal affects the water level in nearby wells.
The minimum flow of the Croton River is between 1 and 2 secondfeet. The flood flow caused by the overflow of the dam is at times more than 3,000 second-feet. Change in stage in the river is accompanied by change in head in all the wells.
In the present investigation weekly water-level measurements were begun December 8, 1936. During drilling operations prior to that time occasional measurements were made at more frequent intervals. At present there are five automatic water-stage recorders in operation on different wells.

NORTH CAROLINA
STATE-WIDE PROJECT
By E. D. Burchard
The program of water-level measurements In wells In North Carolina, described In Water-Supply Paper 777 on page 130, was continued In 1936. The number of wells under observation during the year was reduced from 9 to 7 because the automatic water-stage recorder on the McCauley well at Chapel Hill was removed for repairs and has not been reinstalled and the Huffine well at Huffine's mill, near Gibsonville, was used for a source of water supply. Of these 2 wells only records of the water level in the Huffine well were given in Water-Supply Paper 777.
In general, the water levels in the observation wells reached the highest stages of record in April, 1936. Recovery from the low levels of 1935 was notably abrupt in January, and the fall depletion In 1936 was neither as extended or as low as In previous years, so that as a result the water levels stood comparatively high at the end of the year. The water level In the Kurfee well, at Mocksville, reached a stage of 14.86 feet above an arbitrary datum on April 6, 1936, which Is 2.10 feet above the previous high recorded on April 25, 1935, and 12.12 feet above the lowest stage recorded on February 5, 1932. The water level In this well on December 31, 1936, stood 5.09 feet higher than on December 31, 1935.
Records of water level in 1936 in the 7 wells under observation are given In the following table. The water levels In each well are expressed In feet above an arbitrary datum which, together with the measuring point and other features of the well, are described in Water-Supply Paper 777. Water levels given for the Kurfee and Preuler wells are mean daily stages computed from automatic water-stage recorder charts and the water levels given for the other wells are Individual measurements.

DEEP RIVER AREA OP SOIL CONSERVATION SERVICE By V. C. Fishel, P. C. Ames, and H. W. Palm
I/ The observation well program in the Deep River Area in Guilford, Forsyth, and Randolph Counties, near High Point, N. C., was continued in 1936 by the United States Geological Survey in cooperation with the Soil Conservation Service, J. H. Stallings, project manager. Water-level measurements were made by members of the Geological Survey and the Soil Conservation Service about weekly, in 23 wells during 1936. Pour of the wells were equipped with automatic water-stage recorders. Approximately 650 measurements were made during the year ending December 31, 1936. The average weekly stage of the water levels is given in the following table. The water-level measurements of wells 11 and 13, which were dry at times, are included in the report, but they were not used in computing the average water levels. Well 17, for which water-level measurements are given in Water-Supply Paper 777, has been discontinued. Water-level measurements for wells 9 and 9 b, which are not included in Water-Supply Paper 777, are given in this report and were used in computing the average water levels. Thus 21 wells (l, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 9b, 10, 12, 14, 15, 18, 19, 20, 21, 23, 24, 25, and 27) were used in computing the average water levels given in this report for the entire period of record to December 31, 1936. The water levels declined an average of more than half a foot from the beginning of observations in October 1934 to November 27, recovered about 1.5 feet by December 4, declined about 0.7 foot by December 18, and then recovered 0.8 foot by January 8, 1935. The water levels generally rose until about April 2, when they reached the highest average stage during 1935, which was about 3.0 feet higher than on January 1. They then declined with few interruptions

until December 27, when they attained the lowest average stage during the year, which was 5.63 feet lower than on April 2.
Heavy precipitation caused an average rise In the water levels of 3.8 feet between December 27, 1935 and January 4, 1936. The water levels rose and declined In response to the precipitation during January, February, and March. On April 10, 1936, they reached the highest average stage during the period of record and stood an average of 4.0 feet higher than on January 4. They then declined an average of 6.62 feet by September 25 but recovered nearly 2.0 feet by October 16. They declined during November but recovered by January 1, 1937, to an average stage 1.3 feet higher than on October 16.
The average water level on January 1, 1937, was 0.58 foot higher than on January 1, 1936, and 1.94 feet higher than on January 1, 1935.

ELIZABETH CITY AREA
By Stanley W. Lonman
An Investigation of the ground-water supply in the Elizabeth City
area, Pasquotank County, N. C., was made during the winter of 1932-33
by the United States Geological Survey in cooperation with the North
Carolina Department of Conservation and Development and with the
Elizabeth City Public Utility Commission. The investigation was under-
taken to determine the water-bearing properties of the shallow sands and
especially the possibility of developing a ground-water supply that would
be adequate to replace a surface-water supply from Knobbs Creek a
supply that had become salty as a result of the drought of 1930-32. The
results of this investigation have been published in preliminary form 2/
and later in final form, and the character of the water formerly supplied 3/
to the city has been described. As a result of this investigation,
numerous shallow wells were put down over a wide area and pumped from a
central pumping plant, and at present the city derives its entire water i/
supply from this source.
During the course of the investigation information was obtained in
regard to about 12 deep wells and more than 100 shallow wells. Prom one
to about a dozen water-level measurements were made at 82 of the shallow 5/
wells from September 1932 through January 1933, and levels were run to
55 of the shallow wells to facilitate the construction of a water-table 6/
z/contour map. A 7-day automatic water-stage recorder was maintained in-
termittently on one shallow well from July 1933 to August 1934. All
these shallow wells are in the Coastal Plain province and tap fine sand
and sandy loam of the Pamlico formation of Pleistocene age.

226 WATER LEVELS AND ARTESIAN PRESSURE, 1936
In June 1935 the Public Utility Commission, on the recommendation of the Geological Survey, put down a new observation well (city well 31T) near the municipal well field, and installed on this well a 7-day automatic water-stage recorder. Other wells in and near the well field are being observed periodically by the city, but the present report gives only the water levels for the well equipped with the recorder.
City well 31T is located 1,000 feet north of Jackson road, opposite the middle of the Jackson well field, and about 2,500 feet northwest of the city's pumping plant in the Ives well field, on property owned by J. M. Jackson. The well fields are 3 miles west of Elizabeth City. J. J. Stokes, a city employee, measures the depth to water level each week by the wetted tape method and changes the recorder chart. The well is 8 feet deep and 18 inches in diameter and is cased with tile. There are no pumped wells nearby, and the well is believed to be out of the range of influence of the municipal well fields. The measuring point is the edge of a hole in the instrument shelf, 1.5 feet above the land surface. The land in the vicinity of the well is flat, and the water table generally stands close to the surface, so close in fact that widely spaced drainage ditches are used to carry off excess water.
The water levels listed below are given in feet below the measuring point and were made by the wetted tape method unless otherwise indicated. For weeks in which the water level rose or declined at a nearly uniform rate, no intermediate water levels are given.
The water level fluctuations in this well are typical of a shallow water-table well in a humid region, in which conditions are favorable for recharge. The water table appears to have a well-defined upper limit at about 6 inches below the land surface, and during the brief period of record has not declined below a depth of 6 feet below the land surface. Thus the total range of fluctuation to the present is about 5jj feet.
The water level generally rises abruptly as much as several feet almost Immediately following heavy rains, provided the soil has not dried out completely. However, after prolonged dry spells when the water table has declined to 5 or 6 feet below the land surface and the soil has dried out, it may take considerable rain to first satisfy the deficiency of soil moisture before recharge can take place. This was demonstrated during October and November 1935. With only 0.35 inch of rain October was very dry, and the water level declined steadily to

7.35 feet below the measuring point on October 31. In November the pre-

cipitation was more than 4 inches above normal, and most of the rain

fell on and before November 17, yet the water level did not rise until

after November 17, and then it rose only 0.5 foot.

The precipitation at Elizabeth City in 1936 was 62.10 inches, which

was 14.60 inches above normal. Precipitation was considerably above

normal in each month, except in April, May, and August, which had slight

deficiencies. As a result, high ground-water levels were maintained

throughout most of the year, except for several declines of short dura-

tion during the summer.

NORTH DAKOTA

CITY OP HARVEY

By A. N. Sayre

The city of Harvey, N. Dak., obtains its water supply from two wells in the Sheyenne River Valley, 2.5 miles north of Harvey, in the SW^SW^ sec. 21, T. 150 N., R. 72 W. The wells, which are 25 inches in diameter and 41 feet deep, penetrate 8 feet of silt and 33 feet of rather coarse sand and gravel.
Periodic measurements of water level in one of the city's wells have been made since 1927. The fluctuations in this well are apparently caused in part by pumpage but more largely by the periodicity of the recharge to the ground-water reservoir. During the winter, when the ground is frozen there is little or no recharge and pumping gradually lowers the water level. The frost generally leaves the ground in March and April, and during these months the moisture that was held in the ground when it was frozen,together with water from melting snow and precipitation moves down to the water table. This recharge in many years causes a very abrupt and large rise of the water level. Although a large part of the annual precipitation occurs during the summer, the water level in the Harvey well generally declines rather persistently throughout this season, partly because the pumpage is greatly increased and also because much of the precipitation that seeps into the ground in the summer is evaporated or is used by plants.
Water-level measurements in the Harvey well, furnished by A. N. Beiseker, city auditor of Harvey, are given in the following table.

VILLAGE OF SHEYENNE
In connection with an investigation of ground-water supplies and dam
sites of the James and Sheyenne River Basins in North and South Dakota
in 1935, A. N. Sayre of the United States Geological Survey measured the
depths to water level in 10 domestic wells in the village of Sheyenne, N.
Dak. Sheyenne has no public waterworks, and its water supply is obtained
from private domestic wells. The wells were visited in August, 1936 by
L. K. Wenzel and V. C. Fishel, also of the United States Geological Sur-
vey, and measurements of depths to water level were made in 7 of the 10
wells in whicfli measurements had been made in 1935. Descriptions of the
wells and the measurements of the water level in them are given below:
1. L. S. Rude. Dug well, diameter 24 inches, depth 12 feet. Measuring point, top of well curb. Depth to water level Mar. 28, 1935, 11.70 feet; Aug. 12, 1936, 9.78 feet.
3. Stockyards. Dug well. Measuring point, top of well platform, 1.1 feet above land surface. Depth to water level Mar. 28, 1935, 10.52 feet; Aug. 12, 1936, 8.43 feet.
5. G. Olson. Dug well. Measuring point, top of concrete curb. Depth to water level Mar. 28, 1935, 15.69 feet; Aug. 12, 1936, 15.17 feet,
6. K. Egger. Measuring point, top of concrete casing. Depth to water level Mar. 28, 1935, 20.85 feet; Aug. 12, 1936, 19.00 feet.
7. E. Moe. Dug well. Measuring point, top edge of concrete easing, flush with land surface. Depth to water level Mar. 28, 1935, 22.25 feet; Aug. 12, 1936, 20.53 feet.
8. J. Larson. Dug well. Measuring point, base of pump, 2 feet above land surface. Depth to water level Mar. 28, 1935, 19.87 feet; Aug. 12, 1936, 18.93 feet.
9. C. Portz. Dug well in basement. Measuring point, top of curb. Depth to water level Mar. 28, 1935, 15.94 feet; Aug. 12, 1936, 14.56 feet.

STILLWATER CREEK AREA OP SOIL CONSERVATION SERVICE
By V. C. Fishel and J. A. Allia I/
The observation well program in the Stillwater Creek area, near Stillwater, Okla., was continued during 1936 by the United States Geological Survey in cooperation with the Soil Conservation Service G. W. Taylor, project manager. Weekly water-level measurements were made on 15 wells during the year except for a short period when measurements were temporarily discontinued in wells 13 and 17. The measurements were made by members of the Soil Conservation Service and the Geological Survey. A total of 757 measurements were made during 1936 and a water-stage recorder was operated on well 17. All water-level measurements that have been mad=e since the beginning of the program are given in this report, including the monthly measurements that were given in Water-Supply Paper 777. The average water levels given in the tables are the averages of the water levels in all the wells except wells 5 and 16. The inclusion of the water levels in well 8 makes the average water levels given in this report somewhat different from those given in Water-Supply Paper 777 for the same period.
The water levels declined an average of about 2 feet from 'June 1 to August 31, 1934, as a result of subnormal precipitation. The 7.5 inches of rain that fell in September had little effect on the water levels, as moat of the rainfall was required to supply soil moisture, the soil having been dried out during the dry summer months. The average water level on January 1, 1935, stood about 0.3 foot higher than on October 1 but was about 1 foot lower than on June 2.
Light rainfall in January and February 1935 caused only small changes in the water levels. Rainfall of about 3 inches in March caused the water levels to rise an average of about 0.5 foot. In response to rainfall of 2.00 inches in April, 3.59 inches in May, and 7.81 inches in June the water levels rose an average of about 1.3 feet by July 1 and reached the highest average stage for the period of record. In July the rainfall was less than half an inch, and the water levels declined sharply. Most of the rain that fell in August, September, October, and November was used to supply the demands of the vegetation and to furnish

soil moisture, with the result that the water levels declined an average of 2.5 feet by December 2. During December the water levels rose an average of 0.26 foot, and at the close of 1935 the average water level stood almost a half foot lower than at the "beginning of the year.
The water levels declined an average of 0.7 foot from January 1 to April 30, 1936, owing to light rainfall during this period. The 3.63 inches of rain that fell in May produced only small changes in the water levels. Light rainfall in June, July, and August resulted in an average decline of the water levels of about 0.8 foot between May 4 and September 7. The water levels rose an average of about 0.5 foot by November 2 as a result of moderate rains in September and October, but declined an average of about 0.4 foot during November and December. Thus the average water level on January 1, 1937, stood about 1.5 feet lower than on January 1, 1936, and about 2.0 feet lower than on January 1, 1935.

By Arthur M. Piper

In the autumn of 1935 a small beginning was made on a continuing program of water-level measurements in the semiarid eastern part of
!/ Oregon. In 1936, this program has been continued through cooperation between the United States Geological Survey and the Oregon State Water Resources Department. Also, the scope of the program has been widened slightly by the construction of five wells In the Baker Valley and four wells in the Grande Ronde Valley to be used exclusively for measurements of ground-water levels. The construction of these nine wells was a project of the Works Progress Administration.
The program of water-level measurements in the Willamette Valley, western Oregon, by the United States Engineer Department ended September 30, 1936, after a term of one year. That program affords records of water-level changes In 114 wells; in 32 of those wells, the water level had been measured by the Geological Survey in 1928-30.
Two tables that follow show, respectively, the yearly range in water level for the Walla Walla Basin and the Willamette Valley the two areas in which measurements have been taken periodically throughout the year and the distribution of observation wells in the State together with the number of water-level measurements in 1936.

PENNSYLVANIA
By Stanley W. Lohman I/
The State-wide observation well program in Pennsylvania was continued in 1936 by the United States Geological Survey in cooperation with The Pennsylvania Topographic and Geologic Survey. At the end of the year weekly water level measurements were being made in 32 wells, one of which was also equipped with a 7-day automatic recorder, and monthly measurements were being made in one well. The monthly measurements on the one well were discontinued January 1, 1937, and weekly measurements on four wells were discontinued during July and August 1936. Weekly water-level measurements in five new wells were begun during those months, thus a total of 37 wells were under periodic observation during part of 1936. A total of 1,584 water-level measurements were made of 1936.
During July and August 1936 the writer visited all the observation wells. New and more substantial measuring points were established at most of the wells, and new wooden platforms were installed on 10 wells. Benchmarks were established at most of the wells and tied in instrumentally to the measuring points. Sketch maps, photographs, and additional des* criptive notes were made for each well.
A report describing the ground-water resources of northwestern 2/
Pennsylvania was published in 1936 by the Pennsylvania Topographic and Geologic Survey. In plate 6 of this report are hydrographs of seven wells, for five of which the complete water-level measurements are tabulated at the end of the present report. The five wells are No. 26, Armstrong County; No. 103, Clarion County; No. 1, Erie County; No. 30, Forest County; and No. 5, Mercer County.
The complete water-level measurements of only one individual well, No. 100, at Montrose, Susquehanna County, are given in Water-Supply Paper 777 on pages 168-169. The present report contains the records for 1936 at well 100, together with the well descriptions and complete water-level measurements for all wells now under observation. The records of 15 discontinued wells are not included, but most of them were used in computing the weekly averages. The weekly average water levels given in Water-Supply Paper 777 on pages 165-166 have been readjusted, and the complete new table of weekly average water levels is given below.

WATER-LEVEL FLUCTUATIONS The precipitation during 1936 was 0.48 inch above average, and as shown in the table of average water levels, the average ground-water level in all observation wells in the State stood 0 0 76 foot higher on January 2, 1937, than on January 4, 1936. In 1936 the total range of fluctuation in the average 'weekly water level was 7.87 feet, the largest on record. The highest average stage, 17.87 feet, occurred on March 21, and the low stage, 10.00 feet, occurred on September 26. The average annual range for the 5 years of record is 5.15 feet, from a minimum of 3.85 feet in 1934 to the maximum given above for 1936. The former maximum of 5.22 feet occurred in 1932. The precipitation in January 1936 was 30 percent above average and the ground-water levels rose steadily until January 18. During the second coldest February in 30 years the precipitation occurred largely as snow, and the ground was frozen. Accordingly the water levels declined rapidly until February 22. There was considerable snow in February although the precipitation was below normal. A rise in temperature produced a general thaw during the last week in February, which raised the average water level more than 2 feet in one week. March was warm, and its precipitation heavier than in any other March on record. Heavy rains and the further melting of the snow on March 11 and 12 flooded all streams in the State and sent the average ground-water level to the high stage of 16.88 feet on March 14. A second deluge, from March 17 to March 19, produced the most devastating flood in the history of Pennsylvania, and sent the already high ground-water levels to the highest average stage during the 5 years of record 17.87 feet on March 21. The precipitation from April 1 through September was considerably below normal, except in August. Except for slight rises during the weeks ending April 11, June 20, and August 29, the ground-water levels declined steadily until they reached an average stage of only 10.00 feet on September 26 - the lowest stage since September 1932, despite the racord-breaking high stage reached during the spring. In October the precipitation was above normal and produced widespread recharge. In November the average precipitation for the State was below normal, owing to drought in southeastern Pennsylvania, but heavy rains on November 4 and 5 in the western part of the State produced an abrupt rise of about 2-j^ feet In the average water level for the whole State by November 7. After this rise the water levels again

262 WATER LEVELS AND ARTESIAN PRESSURE, 1936

declined until December 5. December was moderately warm and wet, and during the month, the average water level rose more than 2 feet.
Thus the rather unusual combination in 1936 of a major flood and a severe drought in the same year was accompanied by the highest average water level and the next to lowest average water level during the period of record.

WELL DESCRIPTIONS AND WATER-LEVEL MEASUREMENTS
On the following pages are given descriptions and weekly water levels for the 32 wells under observation at the end of the year. These descriptions and measurements are arranged alphabetically by counties, and by numbers within the counties. The original field numbers of the wells are used.
For each well that was measured on November 28, 1931, the water levels are expressed in feet above an assumed datum that is 10 feet below the water level In the well on that date. For each well added since that date a datum was assumed that gave the well, at the beginning of its record, a stage equal to the average stage for all other wells in the State on the same date. Thus, for any well all water levels given are exactly comparable, even though the measuring points may have been changed several times, and they are approximately comparable with the water levels given for other wells and with the average water levels given in the preceding table.

SOUTH CAROLINA
TIGER RIVER AREA OP SOIL CONSERVATION SERVICE
By V. C. Plshel and J. H. Terry !/
The observation well program in the Tiger River area In Spartanburg and Greenville Counties, S. C., was continued in 1936 by the United States Geological Survey in cooperation with the Soil Conservation Service, T. S. Buie, project manager. Water-level measurements were made about weekly in 26 wells during the year by members of the Geological Survey and the Soil Conservation Service. A water-stage recorder was operated continuously on well 3, and two other recorders were operated on other wells for short periods. Approximately 1,300 measurements were made during the year ending December 31, 1936.
The numbers of the wells in the North Tiger area as given in WaterSupply Paper 777 have been changed; thus in the present report wells 1 to 9 are numbered 31 to 39 respectively. Wells 14 to 19 are in Greenville County, the others are in Spartanburg County.
Some water is withdrawn at times from wells 10, 17, 18, 31 and 32, hence the water-level measurements for these wells were not used in computing the average water levels, but the measurements are given in this report. Well 11, for which water-level measurements are given in WaterSupply Paper 777, was destroyed to make way for a new road. The average water levels given in the present report do not correspond to those given in Water-Supply Paper 777, because wells 10, 11, 31, and 32 have been excluded from the list of wells used in computing the new average^ and well 19 has been added to the list. The average water levels for the entire period of record are given in this report and were obtained by averaging the water levels in 20 wells, numbered 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 12, 14, 15, 16, 19, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, and 39.
The average fluctuations of the water levels in the North Tiger and South Tiger areas are practically the same in amplitude and essentially synchronous in phase, but the fluctuations in some of the individual wells, especially in the South Tiger area, deviate appreciably from the average. Thus the times of the highest and lowest stages in some of the

wells varied as much as several months from the highest and lowest average stages. In most of the wells the water levels rose from the beginning of June 1934, when the first measurements were made, until about the end of July and then declined an average of more than 1 foot by January 1, 1935. The water levels rose an average of about 1 to 4 feet from January 1 until about May 20, 1935. They remained practically at the same stage until about July 1 and then declined about 1.4 feet by December 23, at which time the average water level stood only 0.10 foot higher than on January 1, 1935.
On January 6, 1936, the water levels stood an average of about 0.8 foot higher than on December 23, 1935. The water levels rose steadily until May 18, at which time they reached the highest average stage during the period of record 3.96 feet higher than on January 6, 1936, and 4.88 feet higher than the lowest average stage of record on January 1, 1935. They declined an average of about 2.0 feet between May 18 and October 5 and then rose about 0.1 foot by December 28. They rose an average of about 0.3 foot during the week following December 28.
On December 28, 1936, the average water level stood 2.0 feet higher than on January 6, 1936; about 3.0 feet higher than on January 1, 1935; and about 1.8 feet higher than on July 1, 1934.

SOUTH DAKOTA
CITY OP HURON
By A. N. Sayre
The city of Huron, S. Dak., obtained a water supply for many years prior to 1934 from a reservoir on the James River. As a result of a series of dry years that began in 1930, the flow of the James River greatly declined and the amount of storage in the reservoir became small during summer, when the draft on it was high. In 1934 the storage in the reservoir was depleted to so great an extent that it became necessary to obtain a new source of supply, and several investigations were made for the purpose of developing a supply of ground water. The city of Huron drilled a series of test wells to determine the thickness of sand and gravel beds in the glacial drift west of the city. Physical tests of samples of sand from the wells were made by Black and Veatch, consulting engineers of Kansas City, and geophysical explorations were made by B. C. Petsch of the South Dakota Geological Survey, under the direction of E. P. Roithrock, State geologist. These investigations indicated that the greatest th'ickness of sand and gravel lay beneath an area about 4 miles west of Huron in the W-|NW^ sec. 9, T. 110 N., R. 62 W., and on the advice of the engineers a 90 acre tract was purchased and four large wells ab©ut 80 feet deep were drilled. The aquifers were found to contain considerable water, and from September 1934 to April 1935 the entire water sgupply of Huron was obtained from this development. Since that time the city's water supply has been taken at times from the James River and at times from the wells, depending on the amount of storage in the reservoir. Black and Veatch submitted several copies of their report to the City Council of Huron early in 1935. The results of the geophysical exploration of the well field were published by the South Dakota Geological Survey as Report of Investigations No. 24, a shallow water supply for Huron, S. Dak., by E. P, Rothrock and B. C. Petsch,. January 1935. A summary of an investigation of the ground-water supply of Huron made in 1935, after the well field was placed in service by the writer, was published by the United States Army Engineers in the report of the Chief of Engineers, appendix 4, James and Sheyenne River Basins, North Dakota and South Dakota, pages 98-107, 1935.
In August 1934 an observation well was drilled near the center of the city's property about 420 feet east and 1425 feet south of the

northwest corner of section 9. Periodic measurements of the water level have been made in this well since about the time pumping was begun. The water-level measurements and pumpage from the city's wells are giver, in the following table. During some periods water was pumped both from the wells and from the river, and it is not possible to determine the quantity pumped from the wells. Part of the following data were supplied by M. E. Kirby and part by D. I. Sears, city manager of Huron. Some of the water levels were interpolated from a graph furnished by Mr. Sears.

MEMPHIS
In 1928 and 1929 the United States Geological Survey in cooperation with the Tennessee Geological Survey made an investigation of the groundwater resources of western Tennessee. The results of this investigation
!/
have since been published. In connection with the cooperative work records were collected of the water levels in the Auction Avenue "wet well" and the Central Avenue well, in Memphis. The fluctuations of water level in the Auction Avenue well from April 1927 to March 1931 and in the Central Avenue well from October 1928 to March 1931 are presented graphically in plate 14 in Water-Supply Paper 656. The records on these wells to September 1929 are presented graphically in plate 2 in Water-Supply Paper 638-C.
The Auction Avenue "wet well" is located in the old pumping station on Auction Avenue, Memphis. The measuring point (no. 1) is top of shell of wet well, altitude 233.03 feet above mean Gulf datum, 114.01 feet above zero datum of Memphis Water Department, and 44.01 feet above an arbitrary datum. The level of the water in the Auction Avenue "wet well" represents the static level in about 100 wells, all of which flow into tunnels leading to the "wet well". These wells are scattered over a rectangular area 5,000 by 3,000 feet, which is within 400 feet of the Wolf River at the nearest point. A record of the altitude of the water level in the Auction Avenue "wet well" taken daily at 8:30 a.m. was kept from April 1927 to October 1928; since that time an automatic water-stage recorder has been operated on the well.
The Central Avenue well is in Peabody Park, near the corner of Central Avenue and Tanglewood Street. It is 4 miles from the Mississippi River and 2 miles from the nearest pumping well of the Memphis Artesian Water Department and is in a section where there is only a little private pumping. The measuring point (no. 3) is top of well pipe rim in shelter, altitude 291.20 feet above mean Gulf datum and 85.00 feet above an arbitrary datum. An automatic water-stage recorder has been operated on the well since observations were begun in 1928.
Since the 1928-30 study a new pumping station,on Southern Avenue about 6 miles east of the Central Avenue station,has been put into

operation. The addition of this plant gi^s the Water Department a

capacity in excess of its usual needs and permits large variations in

the distribution of pumpage, with consequent variations in water level

in the two observation wells.

Daily average watW levels in the Auction Avenue "wet well" from

October 15, 1932, to April 6, 1933, and fron July 17 to December 31,

1936, are given in a following table, and daily average water levels

in the Central Avenue well from October 15, 1932, to December 31, 1936,

are given in another table. The water levels are given in heights

above an arbitrary datum, which may be converted to altitudes above

mean Gulf datum from the information given above. These records were

obtained in cooperation with the Tennessee Geological Survey, under the

direction of C. E. McCashin, district engineer.

Detailed investigations of ground-water conditions in certain areas in Texas were continued during 1936 by W. N. White, A. N. Sayre, Penn Livingston, and S. P. Turner, under the general supervision of Mr. White, in cooperation between the United States Geological Survey and the Texas State Board of Water Engineers. An investigation of the ground-water supplies of the El Paso, Tex., area was begun in 1935 by A. N. Sayre and Penn Livingston and was continued through 1936. The investigation in the Houston area, which was begun in 1930, was continued under the direction of Mr. White, and a manuscript report on the area was released to the city officials. In most parts of the State, no measurements were obtained of water levels in wells that were included in Water-Supply Paper 777, chiefly because of inclement weather conditions.
The fol]owing reports have been published by the Geological Survey in addition to those listed in Water-Supply Paper 777:
Sayre, A. N., Geology and ground-water resources of Ulvalde and Medina Counties, Tex.: U. S. Geol. Survey Water-Supply Paper 678, 1936.

In addition to the regular program of ground-water investigations a state-wide inventory of wells, begun in 1935 under the direction of Mr. Turner with funds allocated by the Works Progress Administration, was continued. The inventory consists of gathering information regarding wells and springs in certain counties, collecting samples of water for chemical analysis, and measuring the depth to the water level in all of the wells that can be measured. Information on springs and wells was collected in the following counties: Andrews, Austin, Bailey, Brazoria, Burleson, Cherokee, Comal, Dallam, De Witt, Poard, Port Bend, Freestone, Gillespie, Glasscock, Gonzales, Gregg, Guadalupe, Hansford, Hardeman, Henderson, Howard, Karnes, Lamb, Lavaca, Lee, Leon, Lubbock, Martin,'Milam, Nacogdoches, Panola, Rusk, Refugio, Smith, and Wilson.

reports consisting of tabulations of well data, well logs, chemical analyses, and a map showing locations of wells have been issued by the Texas State Board of Water Engineers for each of the following counties: Bailey, Cherokee, Hansford, Hardeman, Renders on, Lavaca, and Martin. Reports on the other counties in which information was obtained will be released as they are completed. In most of these counties no periodic water-level measurements are being made. In Howard County, however, periodic water-level measurements were made in a number of the wells in the well fields of the city of Big Spring. The water-level measurements in a few of these wells are given in this report.
The Resettlement Administration has continued the water-level measurements in some of the wells in certain parts of the Panhandle of Texas that were begun by C. V. Theis, H. P. Burleigh, and H. A. Waite during their reconnaissance investigation of the ground-water conditions in the southern part of the High Plains in 1933 and 1934. The Resettlement Administration, upon the advice of W. N. White, has also begun systematic water-level measurements in many additional wells in the parts of the Panhandle where resettlement projects are being undertaken. These measurements are not available for release at the present time but presumably will be released in a later report.
The Soil Conservation Service has continued systematic measurements of ground-water levels in their Elm Creek and Deer Creek areas near Temple, Tex. These measurements are included in this report following the sections on Bexar, Howard and El Paso Counties.

Bexar County Several measurements of water level were made in 1936 in wells in

Howard County The city of Big Spring obtains its water supply from wells that tap the Trinity sand in the Edwards plateau. The Edwards plateau occupies a large area south of Howard County and extends northward into the county as a triangular upland area, the northern limit of which is immediately south of Big Spring. The plateau is bounded on the north and northeast by a sharp escarpment of more than 200 feet and on the northwest by a rather gentle slope. It is underlain by the Edwards and Glen Rose limestones, below which is the Trinity sand. The Trinity crops out near the base of the escarpment and is underlain by Triassic Red Beds which, in general, do not yield water to wells. In most of the area the Trinity sand yields small amounts of water to wells. There are, however, certain rather small areas'in which yields of as much as 200 gallons a minute are obtained. The city has developed four such areas as well fields. The two areas in which the largest yields are obtained are topographical and structural depressions called "sinks". In these sinks the Trinity and the overlying formations are locally present. One of the other areas shows no structural disturbance and the fourth is apparently a gentle structural depression. The logs of the wells drilled in 1936 in the largest sink, about six miles southeast of Big Spring, indicate that the Trinity sand has dropped down as much as 200 feet and that the beds of sand are inclined for nearly half a mile from the center. Before pumping began, water flowed from rather large springs at the lower side of the sinks. The heavy pumping has caused the water level to decline and the springs have ceased to flow. Heavy pumping lowers the water level in the summer, and although it recovers somewhat during the winter, when pumping is at a minimum, there has been in general an annual net decline of the water level in each of the well fields. The following measurements of water level were made by Howard Samuel, project superintendent, during an investigation of the ground-water supply of Howard County under an allocation of funds by the Works Progress Administration.

330 WATER LEVELS AND ARTESIAN PRESSURE, 1936
El Paso County
In July 1935 a study of the ground-water resources in the vicinity of El Paso, Tex., was begun by the United States Geological Survey in cooperation with the city of El Paso through the Texas Board of Water Engineers. Penn Livingston and A. N. Sayre were assigned to this investigation, working under the general direction of 0. E. Meinzer and W. N. White, of the division of ground water, United States Geological Survey.
The water supply for the cities of El Paso and Juarez, and several private industries is pumped from wells that penetrate a series of sands and clays. A part of the water is pumped from wells in the valley of the Rio Grande and a part is pumped from wells on the mesa. The water in beds that underlie the mesa, from about 200 to 880 feet beneath the surface, is potable. The water from some of the beds under the valley is potable, but that from many of the beds is highly mineralized. The lowering of the fresh-water level in the wells in the valley by pumping and the attendant danger of contamination of the fresh-water supply by the highly mineralized water led to the cooperative study of the ground-water supply in the area. During the investigation monthly measurements were made of the depths to water level in about 35 observation wells, and in addition water-stage recorders were maintained for varying lengths of time on wells 37, 41, 51, and 52. Water-level measurements in about 40 wells in which only one measurement was made are not included in this report.
The accompanying table gives 3 water-level measurements made in 1934, 239 measurements made in 1935 and 343 measurements made in 1936.
Frequent determinations were made of the altitude Of the water surface in wells 77, 112, 114, 119, and 120 during the period December 16-26, 1935, for the purpose of estimating the permeability of the formation supplying the mesa wells. Well 78 was pumped at the rate of about 2.2 million gallons a day, beginning at 10:00 a.m. on December 16. The distances of the observation wells from it were as follows: well 77, 2,332 feet; well 112, 1,330 feet; well 114, 1,008 feet; well 120, 474 feet; well 119, 150 feet. The well numbers in the following table correspond to the numbers that will appear in the table of well records in the report on the ground-water resources, now in preparation. The periodic observations of the water level in the following wells are being continued to serve as a guide for the proper development of the ground-water supply in this area.

ELM CREEK AND DEER CREEK AREAS OF SOIL CONSERVATION SERVICE
By V. C. Fishel and V. L. Austin I/
The observation well program in the Elm Creek and Deer Creek areas, near Temple, Texas, was continued in 1936 by the United States Geological Survey in cooperation with the Soil Conservation Service. Water-level measurements were made about weekly in 21 wells during the year by members of the Soil Conservation Service. Automatic water-stage recorders were operated throughout the year on 6 wells (4, 6, 13, 14, 23, and 28). Approximately 700 measurements were made during the year ending December 31, 1936.
The average water-levels given in the present report do not correspond to those given in Water-Supply Paper 777 because wells 1 and 19 have been excluded from the list of wells used in computing the new averages, and wells 4, 6, and 9 have been added to the list. Thus 21 wells (4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11, 12, 13, 14, 20, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 52) have been used for computing the average water levels for the entire period of record.
There appears to be a close correlation in this area between the fluctuation of the water levels in the wells and the precipitation. The area was severely affected by the drought in 1934 with the result that the water levels declined an average of about 6.0 feet from the time of
I/ Water levels and artesian pressure in observation wells in the United States in 1935: U. S. Geol. Survey Water Supply Paper 777, pp. 224-227, 1936.

340 WATER LEVELS AND ARTESIAN PRESSUREj 1936
the initial measurements in April until about October 29. About 7 inches of precipitation during November raised thd water levels an average of about 1.5 feet by December 1 and they were maintained at nearly the same stage throughout December and January. There was about 3 inches of precipitation in February 1935, and during the month the water levels rose an average of about 2.0 feet. A dry March permitted a slight decline, but about 2 inches of rain in April, 8 inches in May and 8 inches in June resulted in an average rise of 3.0 feet by June 28. The precipitation averaged less than 2 inches in July and August, and the water levels declined nearly 3.0 feet during these months. However, about 7 inches of precipitation in September caused a rise of about 2.0 feet, and about 6 inches in December caused another large rise. Thus on December 18, 1935, the average of the water levels was at the highest stage during the year, which was 5.44 feet higher than the low stage of the year on January 17 and 5.37 feet higher than on January 1, 1935. The few measurements that were made between December 18 and January 3 indicate no great change in the water levels between these dates.
Low precipitation during January, February, and March, 1936 permitted the water levels to decline an average of 2.5 feet by March 31. Moderately heavy precipitation during April and May caused a rise of about 3.4 feet by June 4. The water levels declined an average of nearly 4.0 feet from June 4 until about September 22. At this time the water levels reached their lowest average stage of the year, which, however, was 2.56 feet higher than the lowest average stage in 1935. Heavy precipitation in October and December caused an average rise of more than 5.0 feet by December 31, when the water levels reached the highest average stage during the period of record beginning in April 1934.
The average water level on December 31 stood about 2.1 feet higher than on January 1, 1936, 7.55 feet higher than on January 1, 1935, and about 2.5 feet higher than in April 1934, when the first measurements were made.

UTAH
By G. H. Taylor and H. E. Thomas
The ground-water investigation in the State of Utah during 1936 followed essentially the program that was begun in 1935. Most of the records of fluctuations of ground-water levels were obtained by the United States Geological Survey in cooperation with the State engineer of Utah. The number of observation wells was increased from about 230 at the end of 1935 to about 360 at the end of 1936. This number includes several wells in each of the areas of important ground-water development in Utah and numerous wells in smaller or less important areas. Many of the ground-water areas are not covered as completely as is desired and wells also are needed in other smaller and more remote areas. About 6 water-level or pressure measurements were made during 1936 in wells in the areas of major ground-water development, and one or two measurements were made on observation wells in areas of lesser importance. Eighteen automatic recording gages were maintained on wells by the Geological Survey in Utah during 1936.
In addition to the data obtained through the cooperative investigation between the United States Geological Survey and the State engineer
s/of Utah, a considerable amount of information concerning the wells in
the State was obtained directly by the State engineer as a result of the underground-water law which was enacted by the 1935 session of the
3/ Utah State legislature. These data include information concerning the type, size, and use of wells and the water-bearing materials penetrated, which were furnished by well owners as required by law. Detailed locations of the wells and altitudes of benchmarks established at the wells were generally furnished by the State engineer. Claims had been filed by owners of 14,68S wells prior to June 30, 1936, and it was estimated that 10,000 existing wells were yet unclaimed. The State engineer has not completed the establishment of benchmarks and locations of wells but expects eventually to have this information for all wells in the State.
The Salt Lake City Corporation, under the direction of G. D. Keyser, commissioner of water supply and waterworks, continued to collect records of ground-water level in the Jordan River Valley.

348 WATER LEVELS AND ARTESIAN PRESSURE, 1936

The water-level measurements made in the city's observation wells that

are included in the State program were kina±y supplied to the Geological-

Survey by the Salt Lake City Corporation.

Earl Lemon, of Wlllard, continued to furnish measurements on well

(B-7-2)2ab. W. S. Lemon, of Woods Cross, furnished measurements on well

(B-2-l)35ad2 and maintained an automatic recording gage on well (B-2-l)

36bb3.

A short report on the fluctuations of ground-water levels and inter-

ference of wells in the vicinity of Lehi, Utah County, is being prepared i/
from field data gathered during 1935 and 1936. A report was made on

ground-water conditions in a typical area in the vicinity of Woods

Cross, Davis County.

A summary of the net change in ground-water level in observation

wells in Utah in 1936 is given in the following table. This summary

does not include all wells that are being measured periodically, because

a yearly comparison of the water levels in some of them could not be

made and the location or some individual characteristic of other wells

did not justify their inclusion. Net changes in water level in 1936 are

based on measurements of the water level made during November and Decem-

ber 1935 and 1936 or Interpolations of the position of the water level

during those months.

The ground-water level rose in most areas during 1936. There were average net declines in only 3 of the 22 ground-water areas, and only in Cedar City Valley, in Iron County, did the water level in all observation wells decline. In most areas where the water level averaged a net change of 1 foot or less, the maximum and minimum changes in individual wells, shown in columns 3 and 4, were small, and the average net change in each of these areas is probably representative of conditions over the area. However, in areas where the water level averaged a net change of more than 1 foot the greatest change usually occurred in wells located at or nearest areas of ground-water recharge, and the smallest change usually occurred in the wells at greater distances from the recharge area. In these areas the average net change, shown in column 5, may not represent general conditions.
The following tabulation includes all measurements of water levels in wells made by the United States Geological Survey in the State of Utah from 1931 to 1936, inclusive, and all measurements of water levels prior to January 1, 1937, collected from other sources, except those published in Water-Supply Paper 796-D, Geology and ground-water resources of Ogden Valley, Utah, and Water-Supply Paper 777, Water levels and artesian pressure in observation wells in the United States in 1935; and a large number of measurements made in the Jordan River Valley from 1931 to 1935, inclusive, which are to be published in another report. The tabulation includes all water-level measurements which have been made in 'the Jordan River Valley on observation wells that have been

continued as a part of the State observation-well program and which do not appear in Water-Supply Paper 777.
The tabulation includes all measurements made or obtained by the United States Geological Survey during 1936, consisting of the records from automatic recording gages operated regularly on 14 wells, records from automatic recording gages operated for short periods on 9 wells, about 2,280 periodic measurements made on 360 observation wells, and about 1,430 measurements made on 498 wells not measured periodically. It also includes the following records obtained prior to 1936: Records from 13 wells equipped with automatic recording gages, about 1,800 individual periodic measurements of the water level in observation wells, arid about 925 individual measurements of the water level in wells not measured periodically. A total of more than 6,400 individual measurements are tabulated, exclusive of the records from recording gages.
Measurements of depths to water and artesian pressure were made by the United States Geological Survey except as indicated. Most flowing wells were closed 10 minutes before measurement of the pressure head-. Altitudes, where given, are in feet above mean sea level, United States Geological Survey datum. All altitudes given were obtained by instrumental leveling; those in the Jordan River Valley were determined by the United States Geological Survey and most of the remainder were determined by the State engineer. For wells on which automatic waterstage recorders or pressure gages have been maintained, only a sufficient number of measurements are included in the following tabulation to outline the general trend of the water level; the complete record is available at the office of the United States Geological Survey at Salt Lake City.
Throughout this report the well number indicates the location by land subdivision according to a well-numbering system used in the State
5/ of Utah. The complete well number comprises a group in parentheses designating the township, consisting of a letter designating the quadrant in relation to the base point of the standard base and meridian system, the number of the township, and the number of the range; the number of the section, a letter designating the quarter section, another letter designating the quarter of the quarter section, and a number designating the particular well within the 40-acre tract.

By this system the letters A, B, C, and D designate, respectively, the northeast, northwest, southwest, and southeast quadrants of the standard base and meridian system of the General Land Office, and the letters a, b, c, and d designate, respectively, the northeast, northwest, southwest, and southeast quarters of the section and quarter section. Thus, the number (B-2-l)25ba3 designates well 3 in the NE^ NW-J sec. 25, T. 2 N., R. 1 W., and the number (D-5-l)l9acl designates well 1 in the SW-J NEjsec. 19, T. 53., R. 1 E. (the letter B showing that the township is north of the Salt Lake base line and the range west of the Salt Lake meridian, and the letter D showing that the township is south of the Salt Lake base line and the range east of the Salt Lake meridian). If the location is within the land subdivisions based on the Uinta Special base and meridian, in the northeastern part of the State, this is indicated by prefixing the letter U. Thus, well U(A-2-l)36cd2 is well 2 in the SEf SW-i sec. 36, T. 2 N., R. IE., Uinta Special base and meridian. This system can be extended to designate the location within a 10-acre tract by adding another letter to the number. This has been done for a few wells whose location is known with sufficient detail, such as well (A-ll-l)8dac4, which designates well 4 in the SW-J NEj SEj sec.-8, T. 11 N.; R. 1 E., Salt Lake base and meridian.
The name of the town or community nearest to the location of each well is given immediately after the well owner's name.
In the columns headed "Water level" the minus sign indicates depth to water, and the plus sign indicates the artesian pressure head.

VIRGINIA
By 0. E. Melnzer, R. C. Gady, and V. C. Fishel I/
The observation well program in Virginia was continued in 1936 by the United States Geological Survey. Weekly measurements were made on the 5 wells mentioned in Water-Supply Paper 777 and on 9 other wells that were added to the program in 1936 or in the later part of 1935. Of the new wells 7 were established on the Swart farm near Fairfax, 1 on the Burke farm near Fairfax, and 1 on the Glendale farm near Catlett.
The height of the measuring point and benchmark above arbitrary datum planes for each of the Ross, Bacon, Halls Hill, and Bell wells is as follows:
Ross well: Height of measuring point above datum plane, 35.60 feet from the beginning of observation to June 22, 1936; 36.57 feet since June 22. Height of benchmark above datum plane: No. 1, 34.57 feet; no. 2, 33.34 feet.
Bacon well: Height of measuring point above datum plane, 33.60 feet from the beginning of observation to June 18, 1936; 35.52 feet since June 22. Height of benchmark above datum plane; No. 1, 34.89 feet; no. 2, 37.63 feet.
Halls Hill well: Height of measuring point above datum plane, 44.80 feet since beginning of observation. Height of benchmark above datum plane: No. 1, 45.69 feet; no. 2, 41.47 feet.
Bell well: Height of measuring point above datum plane, 24.00 feet from the beginning of observation to June 19, 1936. A garage was built on the site of the old well, and a new well was constructed 150 feet northeast on June 27, 1936. Height of measuring point of the new well above datum plane, 24.96 feet. Height of benchmark above datum plane: No. 1, 24.03 feet; no. 2, 26.64 feet.
The water levels in the Ross, Bacon, Halls Hill, and Bell wells rose from January 1, 1936, to about February 1. They declined slightly during the first part of February and then rose until about March 21, reaching on that date an average stage of about 3.7 feet above the average stage on January 1. The precipitation was below normal during the summer and fall, and as a result the water levels, except in the Bell well, declined gradually from about March 21 to about December 1. The decline averaged about 6.5 feet in the Ross, Bacon, and Halls Hill wells. The water level in the Bell well responded to some of the rains during
480

this period but nevertheless declined about 8 feet from March to December. Precipitation in December caused the water levels to rise about 0.2 foot in the Ross well, 1.2 feet in the Bacon well, 0.2 foot in the Halls Hill well, and more than 5 feet in the Bell well. The water levels on December 31, 1936, in the Ross, Bacon, Halls Hill and Bell wells were 1.78, 0.91, 2.0, and 0.20 feet respectively lower than on. January 1, 1936.
The Glendale well, 0. E. Meinzer, owner, is 1-J miles northeast of Catlett, Pauquier County, Va., on Highway 233. It is a 6-inch drilled well, 94 feet deep, near the northeast corner of a dairy barn. Windmill tower still over the well but pump removed and well not used. Measuring point is top of casing, about 1.5 feet above land surface, 1.41 feet above benchmark A and 1.52 feet above benchmark B. Benchmark A is a cross cut into concrete floor near northeast corner of the barn; benchmark B is cross cut into concrete foundation of adjacent silo. The well is on a gentle upland slope near small spring-fed valley. Measurements of water level in well and of precipitation recorded by rain gage at same place are made by J. E. Johnson.
Periodic measurements of water level in this well were begun on October 6, 1935, at which time the water level stood 15.6 feet below the measuring point. The precipitation was light during October, and there was practically no change in the water level until November 1. Precipitation of more than 6 inches in November resulted in a rise of the water level of 4.5 feet by November 17. The water level then declined 2.2 feet by December 29 but regained 1.6 feet by the middle of January 1936, at which time the water level stood only 11.6 feet below the measuring point. Precipitation in March caused the water level to rise to a stage of 10.4 feet below the measuring point, the highest stage of record. The water level then declined persistently, as the result of the dry summer and fall, until December 6, when a stage of 16.0 feet below the measuring point was recorded. Subsequent recovery in December carried the water level on January 3, 1937, to a stage 14.09 feet below the measuring point, about 1 foot lower than at the beginning of 1936.
The Burke well is in Fairfax County about 0.2 mile north of the Lee Highway and 1.7 miles west of the junction of the Lee Highway and United States Highway 50. The well is situated near an abandoned house on the top of a hill about 400 feet from Difficult Run. It is an abandoned dug well, cased with rock. The measuring point is t*ie top edge of a. 2-inch board covering the well.

482 WATER LEVELS AND ARTESIAN PRESSURE, 1936

The first measurement of the water level in this well was made November 9, 1935, at which time the water level was 34.85 feet below the measuring point,, Two other measurements were made in November, but no additional measurements were made until October 23, 1936, when the water level stood 35.90 feet below the measuring point. Weekly measurements were begun in October, 19-36. The water level declined to a stage of 36.62 feet below the measuring point on December 4, 1936, but recovered by December 31 to 35.16 feet below the measuring point.
Eight shallow wells on the Swart farm about 1.5 miles from Fairfax, on United States Highway 50, are located in a line 5, 10, 35, 60, 85, 110, 135, and 162 feet respectively from Difficult Run. Well 5 is about 150 feet below the highway bridge. The number of each well is the distance of that well from the stream. Continuous water-stage recorders are operated on wells 5 and 162, and weekly measurements are made on the other wells. A continuous water-stage recorder is operated on the stream near well 5. Well 162 is the Swart well given in Water-Supply Paper 777.
During times of high water level the ground water in the vicinity of the Swart wells moves toward Difficult Run. At low stages the direction of movement of the ground water apparently changes, inasmuch as the water levels in wells 5 and 10 generally decline below the stream level. During these periods of low water levels ground-water divides occur at or near wells 35 and 135 . Thus the ground water apparently moves toward wells 10, 60, and 162. It is not known whether the movement of ground water is exactly parallel to the line of wells.

PALOUSE RIVER AREA OP SOIL CONSERVATION SERVICE
By V. C. Fishel and J. P. Bonner I/
The observation well program in the Palouse river area, in Whitman County, Wash., and Latah County, Idaho, was continued in 1936 by the United States Geological Survey in cooperation with the Soil Conservation Service, W. A. Rookie, project manager. Water-level measurements were made weekly in 52 wells by members of the Geological Survey and the Soil Conservation Service, except for a period during the summer of 1936, when only monthly measurements were made. Two automatic water-stage recorders have been in use since the beginning of the program. One of them has been in continuous operation on well 20. The other has been used for shorter periods on some of the other wells. Approximately 2,250 measurements were made during the year ending December 31, 1936.
The average water levels given in the present report do not correspond to those given in Water-Supply Paper 777, because wells 5 and 19 have been excluded from the liat of wells used in computing the new averages, and wells 8, 14, 17, 28, and 30 have been added to the list. The average water levels for the entire period of record are given in the present report and were obtained by averaging the water levels in 25 wells (1, 2, 4, 6, 7, 8, 11, 12, 14, 17, 18, 20, 20a, 21, 23, 24, 26, 27, 28, 30, 31, 32, 35, 36, and 37).
The measurements of 14 wells (38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 45, 44, 46, 47, 48, 49, 51, 53, and 54), which were begun in 1936, are included in this report but were not used in computing the average water levels. The measurements of 13 wells (IS, 2S, 3S, 4S, 5S, 6S, IN, 2N, 3N, IE, 3E, 4E, and 5E), located on the Pacific Northwest Soil Erosion Experiment Station farm, are also included in this report.
The water levels, measuring points, and benchmarks for each of wells 1 to 37 are expressed in feet above an arbitrary datum 10 feet below the water level in that well on January 1, 1935. For wells 38 to 54, which were begun in April 1936, the water levels were assigned the same heights on the day of their first measurements as the average on the game day of the water levels in wells 1 to 37. The water levels in the wells on the Experiment Station farm are expressed in feet above sea level.

The water levels in all the wells rose an average of about 1.5 feet from the beginning of the measurements on November 5, 1934, to January 1, 1935. and rose about 3.8 feet more during January. This rise continued until April 22, at which time the highest average stage was reached for the period of record beginning November 1934 and ending December 31, 1936. which was about 5.8 feet higher than on January 1, 1935, The water levels declined an average of 8,0 feet by October 8, when they were at the lowest stage for the year. They rose and declined intermittently for the rest of the year and were about 0.7 feet higher on January 1, 1936, than on October 8, 1935.
The water levels rose an average of about 5.5 feet from January 1, 1936 to March 17, when they reached the highest average stage during 1936, which was 1,88 feet lower than the high stage reached in April 1935. There was a gradual average decline of nearly 7 feet from March 17 to October 13, but the water levels recovered about 0.6 foot by January 1, 1937.
The average water level on January 1, 1937, stood about 0.8 foot lower than on January 1, 1936 and 2.2 feet lower than on January 1, 1935.

Experiment Station Wells
Thirteen wells are located on the Pacific Northwest Soil Erosion Experiment Station farm r which includes the NW^ and the SWj-NEi sec. 30, T. 15 N., R. 45 E. Well IN is located 690 feet west and 270 feet south from the southeast corner of the NE^-NWj sec. 30; 2N is 730 feet west and 250 feet north from the same corner; 3N is 10 feet west and 325 feet north from 2N; IS is 40 feet west and 155 feet south from IN; 6S is located on the south edge of the farm and is 1,420 feet east of the southwest corner of the farm. Wells 23, 3S, 4S, and 53 are located in a line between IS and 63. Wells 23, 33, 4S, 53, and 63 are 1,555, 345, 580, 800, and 1,040 feet respectively from IS. Well 5E is located 320 feet west and 1,000 feet south from the southeast corner of the NE-iNW-?- sec. 30. Wells IE, 3E, and 4E are located in a line between IN and 5E, Wells IE, 3E, 4E, and 5E are 420, 905, 1,095, and 1,250 feet respectively from IN.
A summary of the fluctuations of the water levels in these wells is given in the following table, which shows the highest and lowest water levels between December 14, 1934, and December 31, 1936, and the range in fluctuation during that period.

WISCONSIN
CENTRAL AND NORTHEASTERN WISCONSIN
By G. T. Owen
The Wisconsin Conservation Department has conducted, a systematic survey of the shallow ground-water resources of its forest protection districts in central and northern Wisconsin since June 1935. The investigation includes the jetting down of 4-inch test well? to depths of 10 to 25 feet and the pumping of some of these wells to ascertain their yields. The Federal Government has cooperated in the project through che Emergency Conservation Work program.
In 1935 about 1,800 temporary test wells were sunk by the survey crews and depths to water level and yields were obtained on about 1,000 of these wells. In 1936 about 2,500 temporary test wells were sunk, and depths to water level and yields were obtained on about 1,800. The records of these tests are being filed in map and report form at Forest Protection Headquarters, Tomahawk, Wis. It is not expected that these records will be published.
Four observation wells were Installed in 1935 in the central and northeastern parts of the State in connection with this survey. These wells are in Adams County, in central Wisconsin, and in Oneida, Langlade, and Marinette Counties in northeastern Wisconsin. The wells are numbered to correspond with the numbers of the forest protection districts in which they are located. The Wisconsin Geological Survey and the United States Geological Survey have cooperated informally in this part of the program.
These four observation wells are 8 inches in diameter and are cased with No. 14 galvanized sheet-iron well pipe. Each well is equipped with a float-tape gage and a shelter house. The wells range from 14 to 24 feet in depth, and they obtain their water from glacial drift. All four wells reflect water-table conditions. None is in a recognized cone of depression resulting from the pumping of nearby wells.
During 1936 daily gage readings were taken on two of these wells, and two readings a week were taken on a third well. Daily gage readings were made on the fourth well in the period July through December. The readings are made by local observers.

500 WATER LEVELS AND ARTESIAN PRESSURE, 1936

No automatic water-stage recorders have been used thus far, and no instrumental leveling has been done. Measuring points are the pointers on the float-tape gages. The height of the pointer above land surface and above the top of the casing has been measured at each well to insure a reasonable degree of permanence in the altitude of the measuring point. The gages are mounted on leveling tables in such a manner that quick adjustment to a constant height of the measuring point above the top of the casing can be made.
Records of the individual measurements of water level in the observation wells are on file with the division of ground water, United States Geological Survey, and with the Wisconsin Geological Survey. Monthly average water levels to the nearest 0.1 foot in each of three wells and daily water levels in the fourth well in 1936 are given in the following tabulation.

Well 4, Langlade County Well 4 is in the SW^ sec. 20, T. 31 N., R. 11 E., at the Antigo ranger station. The measuring point is the pointer on the float-tape gage, 4.44 feet above land surface. The depths to water level have been converted to heights above an arbitrary datum, 10 feet below the water level on December 10, 1935. On that date the depth to water below the measuring point was 20.11 feet.

Precipitation records are obtained from a rain gage 50 feet from the

well. Snow was melted to give the equivalent amount of rain. The mean

annual precipitation In Wisconsin Is about 31 Inches. Precipitation at

this gaging station in 1936 was therefore about 4 Inches less than the

mean annual precipitation for the State.

The measurements indicate that the average stage of the water level

in the well was 0.20 foot lower In December 1936 than in Deeembe? 1935.

The relatively small depletion of ground water in this subnormal period

of precipitation is explained by the following facts: Very heavy snows

of precipitation is explained by the following facts: Very heavy snows fell during the winter; run-off in the spring of 1936 was relatively small, and a considerable recharge of ground water took place; and the deficiency in precipitation occurred chiefly in the summer, when practically all the rainfall is utilized by vegetation.

Well 5, Marinette County Well 5 is in the SW^ sec. 22, T. 34 N., R. 18 E. The measuring point is the pointer on the float-tape gage, 4.57 feet above the land surface. The depths to water level have been converted to heights above an arbitrary datum, 10 feet below the water level on October 27, 1935. On that date the depth to water level below the measuring point was 17.02 feet.

a/ Snow.

Precipitation records are obtained from a rain gage about 15 miles

from the observation well. Snow was melted to give the equivalent

amount of rain. In 1936 precipitation in this area was about 6 inches

below the mean annual precipitation for the State.

The measurements indicate that the average stage of the water level

was 0.60 foot lower in December 1936 than in December 1935. Heavy snows

during the winter, relatively small run-off in the spring, and recharge

of relatively high magnitude in April and May 1956 explain the fact that

depletion of ground water was not greater during the period of subnormal

precipitation 8

Well 9, Adams County Daily water levels in this well from September 12 to December 25, 1955 are given in Water-Supply Paper 777. Water levels are expressed in feet above an arbitrary datum, 10 feet below the water level on September 12, 1935. The measuring point and the arbitrary datum were not changed in 1936.

Precipitation records are obtained from a rain gage 30 feet from the observation well. Precipitation at this station during 1936 was about 9 inches below the mean annual precipitation for the state.

504 WATER LEVELS AND ARTESIAN PRESSURE, 1936

The measurements Indicate that the average stage of the water level was about 2.80 feet lower in December 1936 than In December 1935. The soils In this locality consist of glacial-lake clays and glacial and alluvial sands. There Is some evidence that the underlying clays form a small basin at this site which may explain the marked decline in the water level in the well. Inasmuch as the effect of subnormal precipitation would be quickly reflected on the water level.

Well 8, OneIda County

Well 8 Is In the SW-J- sec. 26, T. 38 N., R. 7 E. The measuring

point Is the pointer on the float-tape gage, 4.0 feet above the land

surface. The depths to water level have been converted to heights above

an arbitrary datum, 10 feet below the water level on July 2, 1936. On

that date the depth to water level was 4.90 feet below the measuring

point.

The Onelda County well Is on a 2-foot fill at the edge of a spruce swamp. Ground water was encountered at a depth of 2-J feet below the general land surface. Under these conditions the water level in the well responds quickly to small amounts of precipitation.
The precipitation records were obtained from a part-time meteorologlc station about 15 miles from the well site. Records for the months of November and December were not available. The measurements indicate that the water level declined 0.40 foot as a result of the deficiency of precipitation In July, but that Increased precipitation in the succeeding months restored It to a level within 0.06 foot of its stage in July.

COON CREEK AREA OP SOIL CONSERVATION SERVICE
By V. C. Pishel and C. C. Yonkers
!/ The observation well program in the Coon Creek area (also called La Crosse area) in Vernon, Monroe, and La Crosse Counties, Wis., was continued in 1936 by the United States Geological Survey in cooperation with the Soil Conservation Service, M. P. Schweers, project manager. Waterlevel measurements were made about weekly in 14 wells during the year. A water-stage recorder has been operated on well 7 from June 1934 to May 1936 and on well 9 since May 1936. Approximately 700 measurements were made during the year ending December 31, 1936. All water-level measurements made since the beginning of the program are given in the following table, including the monthly measurements given in Water-Supply Paper 777. The measurements of 10 wells (2, 3, 4, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14) are used for computing the average water levels for the entire period of record beginning June 1934. The measurements of 4 wells ( 1, 5, 6, and 7) are included in the following table but were not used in computing the average water levels because it is believed that these wells do not represent normal water-table conditions. Thus the average water levels given in the following table do not correspond to those given in Water-Supply Paper 777. A severe drought culminated in this area in May 1934 and was effectively broken in June or July. The precipitation recorded at La Crosse was 3.56 inches in June, 8.27 in July, 1.90 in August, 9.04 in September, 2.38 in October, 7.01 in November, and 1.12 in December. Thus in spite of the deficiency in the first 5 months of the year, the annual precipitation was 6.92 inches above normal, In the first 4 months of well observations, from July to October 1934, the water levels fluctuated through only a small range and showed little tendency either to rise or to fall. Doubtless a large part of the precipitation was required to supply soil moisture and the demands of vegetation during the growing season. The heavy rains in November produced a moderate rise in most wells, but there was a general decline in December, with the result that on January 1, 1935, the average of the water levels did not differ appreciably from the average at the beginning

of the observations. The precipitation was nearly normal in the winter of 1934-35. The water levels did not change appreciably during January and February. They rose about 0.8 foot during the first week of March and an additional 0.7 foot by March 22. They alternately rose and declined during April, and on May 5 they stood an average of about 0.5 foot higher than on March 22. They then declined 1.2 feet by June 15, rose about 0.5 foot the following week, but declined 0.5 foot by June 29. The water levels changed only slightly until after August 5, when they rose an average of about 1.4 feet during a period of several days and on August 9 reached the highest average stage during the period of record. They declined during the remainder of the year and stood an average of about 1.7 feet lower on January 1, 1936, than on August 9. There was an average net rise of about 0.4 foot during 1935.
The water levels changed only slightly during January and February 1936 but rose an average of 1.5 feet during March. Owing to light rainfall during the summer of 1936, the water levels declined an average of about 1.6 feet from April 1 to September 1. They changed very little during the rest of the year and on December 31 they stood an average of 0.04 foot lower than on January 2, 1936, 0.43 foot higher than on January 1, 1935, and 0.47 foot higher than on June 15, 1934, when the observations were started.
