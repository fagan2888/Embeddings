Introduction
Acoustic transmission characteristics in the submarine environment are influenced by the sound propagation properties of the rock units beneath the sea floor. Geoacoustic models of these rock units are "basic to underwater acoustics and to marine geological and geophysical studies of the earth's crust, including stratigraphy, sedimentology, geomorphology, structural and gravity studies, geologic history, etc." (Hamilton, 1980). Numerous geoacoustic models (e.g., Hamilton, 1980; Stoll, 1980; Hamilton and Bachman, 1982) have been developed from small, local data sets in acoustic transmission studies, but their general utility has been limited by the lack of regional geoacoustic data sets for model parameter determinations. A regional geoacoustic database on the northern U.S. Atlantic margin has been developed for the U.S. Naval Oceanographic Office by the U.S. Geological Survey as an initial step to meet this need. Multichannel seismic-reflection data are the primary sources of acoustic information used in this construction. It is recognized that these data have limited resolution in the upper 500 m of the sedimentary column, critical for transmission studies, but this database can be used in existing geoacoustic models to define the nature and extent of more detailed high-resolution acoustic studies of the upper sedimentary column.
This geoacoustic study of the northern U.S. Atlantic margin (Cape Hatteras to the Canadian boundary) is centered around two major sedimentary basins (Baltimore Canyon Trough and Georges Bank Basin) and the intervening crustal platform (Long Island Platform) (Figures 1, 2 and 3). The geoacoustic parameters in this database (Table 1) are derived from a combination of a seismostratigraphy developed from a grid of multichannel seismic-reflection profiles (Figure 3; Appendices 1 and 3) and acoustic velocity vs depth functions based on normal moveout velocity analyses on multichannel seismic-reflection profiles, velocity sonic logs and checkshot studies at selected industry drillholes (Appendix 2), and wide-angle seismic data from 2-ship seismic experiments. Construction and calibration of the velocity data component of this geoacoustic database is described by Klitgord and Schneider (1994). A digital database of these geoacoustic parameters (e.g., Tables 2 and 3) has been constructed from data along each seismic line and at a 5 minute grid spacing over the area of investigation. Graphical representations of this digital database are in the form of stratigraphic time sections and interval-velocity profiles for the seismic-reflection profiles (Appendix 3), travel-time (seconds) surface contour maps for the base of each stratigraphic unit (Appendix 4), depth (meters) surface contour maps for the base of each stratigraphic unit (Appendix 5), isopach maps of each stratigraphic unit (Appendix 6), interval-velocity contour maps for each stratigraphic unit (Appendix 7), and distribution of gross lithologies within these stratigraphic units (Appendix 8).

The U.S. Atlantic Margin - General Geologic Framework
The U.S. Atlantic continental margin incorporates the coastal plain and continental shelf, slope and rise of the U.S. East Coast. It is bordered on the west by the Appalachian Mountains and on the east by the deep sea of the Atlantic Ocean (Figures 1 and 2). The upper surface of the margin decreases slowly in elevation to seaward across the coastal plain and then is nearly flat across the continental shelf (-0.1° slope). Near the 200-m water-depth isobath, the gradient of the seafloor increases markedly (>2°) in the narrow zone called the continental slope. The sea-floor gradient decreases again (-0.5°) at about the 3000-m water-depth isobath, where it is now called the continental rise. The continental rise grades into the nearly flat deep sea floor with water depths >4500 m. The present continental slope is dissected by numerous submarine canyons where sedimentary material is transported from the shelf to the rise. For this study, we are focusing on the acoustic properties of rocks beneath the continental shelf, slope, and rise.
The geologic framework of the U.S. Atlantic continental margin is the product of a regional tectonic environment that evolved from continental rifting to sea-floor spreading and finally to that of a passive continental margin. Initially, an extensional tectonic regime caused continental rifting (similar to the present-day East African Rift) as the Pangea supercontinent (North American, South American, and African continents) rifted apart in the early Mesozoic (-230187 m.a.; rift phase). The pre-existing continental crust was fragmented and intruded by new igneous material (rift-stage crust). The Atlantic Ocean formed as the continents moved apart and new igneous material (oceanic crust) was emplaced at the Mid-Atlantic Ridge (sea-floor spreading). As the Mid-Atlantic Ridge migrated eastward relative to the North American margin (remaining near the center of the expanding Atlantic Ocean Basin), the heat influx associated with this magmatic activity also moved away and the crust at the edge of the margin began to cool. Thermal contraction of the crust at the margin caused rapid sea-floor subsidence and enabled a thick pile of sediments from the eroding Appalachian Mountains to accumulate along the margin (e.g., Klitgord and others, 1988; Poag and Seven, 1989). This later period (-187 m.a. to Present; postrift phase) is referred to as the passive margin phase of margin development; it is a time when thermal subsidence, sediment loading, and fluctuations in climate and oceanographic environments control the accumulation of sedimentary rock along and across the margin.
The continental margin is a wedge of sedimentary rock overlying basement rocks of igneous or metamorphic origin (Figure 3). This sedimentary wedge thickens in the seaward direction from zero at the Fall Line (the western edge of the coastal plain) to over 15 km beneath the outer continental shelf. A carbonate-bank, shelf-edge platform developed near the boundary between rift-stage and oceanic crust, trapped significant amounts of sedimentary material on the shelf, and formed a steep continental slope. The wedge thins to the east beneath the continental rise (6-10 km) and deep sea (< 6 km), and approaches zero thickness at the crest of the Mid Atlantic Ridge. A rapid thickening of this wedge from 4 km to 8+km occurs at a basement hinge zone beneath the inner continental shelf. Sedimentary rocks in this wedge range in age from Late Triassic (230 m.a.) to Present (Tucholke and Mountain, 1979; Klitgord and Grow, 1981; Poag, 1982, 1985b, 1991, 1992; Olsson and others, 1988; Manspeizer and others, 1989; Poag and Ward, 1993). The base of this sedimentary wedge is constructed of igneous, metavolcanic, and metasedimentary rocks of pre-Mesozoic age (>245 m.a.) west of the basement hinge zone (Manspeizer and others, 1989; Sheridan and others, 1991), Late Triassic and younger (<230 m.a.) beneath the continental shelf and slope (Klitgord and others, 1988;

U.S. Geological Survey Open File Report #94-637
Poag and Ward, 1993), and Middle Jurassic and younger (<187m.a.) beneath the continental rise (Tucholke and Mountain, 1979; Klitgord and Grow, 1980; Poag, 1992).
Between the sea floor and basement, numerous erosional and depositional unconformities (associated with sea-level fluctuations and combinations of oceanographic and tectonic processes) divide the sediment pile into subparallel, near-horizontal layers (Figure 4) (Poag and Schlee, 1984). The deepest of these unconformities, the postrift or breakup unconformity, separates synrift sedimentary rock deposited in a rift environment with extensive faulting and igneous activity, from postrift sediments that accumulated in a broadly subsiding basin. This latter basin of postrift sedimentary fill is usually divided into two basins; one beneath the continental shelf and one beneath the slope, rise and deep sea. The boundary between these two basins is a Jurassic shelf-edge carbonate platform (Poag, 1991) that is poorly imaged on seismic-reflection data (Figure 5) and represents a significant change in depositional environment. Relatively stratified units formed at the seaward base of the platform during the Jurassic and Early Cretaceous, but the development of extensive, overlapping fans during the Late Cretaceous and Tertiary has left a more chaotic stratigraphic record in the upper section (e.g., Figure 6). The ages of these unconformity-bounded units have been determined from biostratigraphic studies of drill hole material (e.g., Figure 4) and occasional bottom sampling where erosion on the continental slope has exposed deeper stratigraphic units (Poag, 1985b, 1991, 1992; Poag and Valentine, 1988).
Sedimentary rock types vary across the margin and were significantly different during various periods of the margin's construction. The synrift sediments included significant amounts of salt and anhydrite mixed with varying amounts of terrigenous clastic and volcaniclastic material. There also may be significant amounts of igneous rock in the synrift section. The primary postrift sediment source is terrigenous clastic material (sandstone and clay mixtures) flooding from onshore mixed with carbonate-rich material deposited near the shelf edge during the first 60 m.y. of the shelf development (Poag, 1991). This later material (limestone and dolomite) formed a carbonate shelf edge during the Jurassic and Early Cretaceous (187 to 130 m.a.) that trapped clastic material behind it and created a steep scarp at the shelf edge (e.g., Figure 5). The continental slope and rise were constructed from the clastic debris which swept over the shelf edge as debris flows and turbidites and mixed with calcareous and silicic pelagic material. Variations in the supply of shelf-derived material and fluctuations in the calcite compensation depth (CCD) are reflected in pelagic-dominated layers (carbonate-rich or shales) and turbidite-dominated layers of clastic material. Fluctuating sea level created an environment in which fan deposition shifted between the shelf and rise. During low stands of sea level, numerous canyons were incised into the shelf slope forming the conduits for sediment transport onto the continental rise. Extensive descriptions and summaries of the geology of the U.S. Atlantic margin have been published in Poag (1982, 1985a,b, 1987, 1991, 1992), Poag and Sevon (1989), Poag and Ward (1993), and in the Geological Society of America centennial series (Sheridan and Grow, 1988).
The Geoacoustic Database
The basic database is a suite of geoacoustic parameters (Tables 1, 2 and 3) for a layered set of acoustic stratigraphic units on the continental shelf and adjacent slope and rise of the Atlantic continental margin of the United States (Poag, 1985b, 1991, 1992; Schlee, 1984; Klitgord and

U.S. Geological Survey Open File Report #94-637
others, 1988; Sheridan and Grow, 1988; Grow and others, 1988). Each of these units is comprised of rocks with lithologies that can vary across and along the margin. All of the rock units in this data base are sedimentary; we have minimal velocity information from the underlying igneous and metamorphic rocks. Primary input data for the database are 1.) seismostratigraphic horizons (Table 4) from seismic-reflection profiles (Figure 2 and Appendix 3), 2.) bio- and litho-stratigraphic information from a sparse set of industry and stratigraphic test wells (e.g., Amato and Bebout, 1980; Amato and Simonis, 1980) (Appendix 2) and surficial sea-floor sampling sites, and 3.) seismic-velocity information from normal-moveout analyses of multichannel seismic- reflection data, sonic logs and checkshot velocity studies at industry and stratigraphic test drill wells (Appendix 2) and seismic-refraction studies (Sheridan and others 1988; Klitgord and Schneider, 1994). These data are used to determine the three-dimensional (horizontal and vertical) geometries of stratigraphic units for the database, lithologies and ages of these units, and RMS sound transmission velocities to the surfaces that bound these units. This set of observations is then expanded to include geologic and acoustic parameters that are derived from this initial set of parameters: density (p), compressional-wave (p-wave) velocity, shear-wave (s-wave) velocity, p-wave attenuation (kp), and s-wave attenuation (ks). These parameters have been
determined at a 5 shot-point spacing along each seismic line (250 m or 500 m; see Appendix 3 for shot point spacings) for stratigraphic information, an -30 or 60 shot point spacing (~ 3000 m) for velocity information (Figure 7), and at a 5-minute grid spacing (9250 m x 7100 m) over the area of investigation (Figure 8). Thus the database is actually two data sets: one confined to points along individual seismic lines and the second interpolated onto a regional grid.
A basic premise in this study is that the geoacoustic parameters of a given unit or reflector are influenced only by the material above it and the unit just below it. The acoustic units are defined by acoustic reflectors that bound them on top and bottom. Nomenclature has been developed for these units such that parameters are related to the surface (reflector) that defines the base of each unit. Two-way travel times (in seconds; sea surface to reflector to sea surface), depth below sea surface (in meters) and RMS velocities, properties related to the entire overlying crustal column, are given with respect to a particular reflector (Figure 9). Densities, thicknesses, p-wave velocities, s-wave velocities and attenuation properties pertaining to a given unit are related to the unit directly above a given reflector. Each reflector has been numbered (see Table 4) to facilitate digitizing and identification in the digital arrays. These numbers monotonically increase with depth (and age) but they have no meaning in a geologic sense. Most of these surfaces are erosional unconformities, some of which have eroded deeply enough into the sedimentary wedge to completely remove one or more underlying units on parts of the margin. In such cases, two or more reflectors merge and there could be ambiguity in identifying the age of the boundary between two units. In the situation shown in Figure 10, reflector 60 is the top of Eocene-Paleocene sediments in some places and the top of Cretaceous sediments in others. The mid-Oligocene unconformity (base of Upper Oligocene; reflector 60) has eroded down to the top of the Cretaceous (base of Paleocene-Eocene; reflector 70) and we have referred to that surface as reflector 60 (base of Upper Oligocene). To avoid ambiguity, we always refer to a reflector as the surface that defines the base of the overlying unit rather than as the top of the underlying unit. In this way, when we discuss the properties in the database, we can refer to material that exists above a reflector, since it is often possible that the original material below a reflector (in the case of reflector 60 it is Eocene-Paleocene material) is now missing. In this convention, prominent geologic boundaries, such as the surface forming the top

of the Cretaceous, will be represented by portions of several reflectors (e.g., reflector 70, then reflector 60 and finally reflector 70 again in Figure 10). This nomenclature (referencing the bottom of units) is different from the standard reference to the top of units, but it eliminates ambiguity in the layer reference frame and simplifies the bookkeeping.
Geoacoustic Parameters The digital database contains the following information at a 3000-m spacing along
each seismic-reflection line and at each of the 5-minute grid points in the study area where adequate data are available: labelling by line number, shot point, latitude-longitude pairs and an array of geoacoustic parameters at each of these points. This parameter array includes information determined from seismic or sample data: reflector number, two-way travel time (T) of each reflector, RMS velocity (Vrms) between sea surface and this reflector, layer age (A) and sediment type (ST). From these data we have calculated at each location: depth (D) in meters to the reflector and thickness (DZ), density (p), p-wave velocity (V p), s-wave velocity (Vs), p-wave attenuation (kp), and s-wave attenuation (ks) for each layer (Tables 1, 2 and 3).

Seismiostratigraphy The acoustic units incorporated into the geoacoustic database are seismostratigraphic units
defined by Poag (1982, 1985a,b, 1987, 1991, 1992; Schlee and others, 1985; Poag and Valentine, 1988; Poag and Ward, 1993) for the U.S. Atlantic margin. This comprehensive division of stratigraphic units has been developed from a seismostratigraphic analysis of seismic profiles on our multichannel seismic grid (Figure 2). This seismostratigraphy has been calibrated with biostratigraphic data from the suite of industry drill wells onshore and offshore (Poag, 1982, 1985b, 1987, 1991, 1992; Poag and Ward, 1993) plus dredge sample data from canyons that dissect the continental slope (Valentine, 1981) and the Blake Escarpment (Dillon and Popenoe, 1988). The two-way travel times to each reflector (sea surface to reflector to sea surface) were digitized along the length of each seismic-reflection profile, creating a seismostratigraphic cross section of time depth vs distance. As mentioned above, these reflectors represent the base of geologic units. Where reflectors intersect, only the youngest reflector is entered into the database. The reflector numbers used in the database are purely arbitrary and are given here to facilitate labelling of computer plots of seismostratigraphic cross sections. Ages assigned to the geologic units are based on the DNAG geologic timescale of Palmer (1983).

Sediment Types and Lithologies Lithologies vary within these units as indicated in the database. The gross lithologies of
stratigraphic units have been determined from lithologic logs at drill holes and dredge samples from submarine canyons that cut deep into the continental slope integrated with the analysis of acoustic character on seismic profiles in our multichannel seismic grid (Poag, 1982, 1985b, 1987, 1991, 1992; Poag and Ward, 1993). This technique is based on the association of distinctive acoustic signatures with specific depositional environments and lithologies (Vail and others, 1977; Poag and Schlee, 1984; Van Wagoner and others, 1988). The resulting
estimates of sediment types are very subjective, therefore, only a small set of lithologies has been incorporated into the database (Table 5). There are few surface samples in deep water seaward of the shelf edge and this region has been assigned a general type of clay (ko = 0.045).

* Rock types are in approximate increasing grain size or proximity to siliciclastic sediment sources

Surficial sediment types (Table 6, Figure 11) along individual seismic lines and on the database grid were extracted from a digital database of over 40 years of surficial sampling compiled by Hathaway and others (1994). This compilation is based on the original work of Hathaway (1971), Schlee (1973), Hathaway and others (1979) and an updated study by Poppe and others (1989) mapping surficial sediment types on the U.S. Atlantic continental margin. The database of surficial sediment types is based on grain size analyses which are used to define sediment types by standard definitions of grain size for specific sediment types. These grain sizes have been correlated with the near-surface attenuation of compressional waves

Seismic Velocities Velocity data for the northern U.S. Atlantic margin (Baltimore Canyon Trough, Long Island
Platform, and Georges Bank Basin regions) are derived from the stacking velocities determined for the multichannel seismic profiles as part of the standard industry processing of seismic-reflection data. The velocity data for our grid of seismic profiles were calibrated at a suite of drill sites in each area, along three standard dip-line transects and on a strike-line transect (Figure 2). Local velocity calibration studies were undertaken along composite seismic profiles connecting industry wells in Georges Bank Basin (Composite CDP Line G1-G2) and in the Baltimore Canyon Trough (USGS CDP lines 14 and 15). One transect crosses Georges Bank Basin (USGS CDP Line 19), one crosses the central Baltimore Canyon Trough (USGS CDP Line 25), and a third goes through a navy test area south of Long Island (USGS CDP Line 22). USGS CDP Line 12 has been used to construct a velocity-structure profile that links these velocity calibration sites with the rest of the seismic grid. Figure 12 is an example of the stratigraphic and interval-velocity data along a seismic line (Line G1-G2). A comprehensive discussion of the velocity data used in this database is given by Klitgord and Schneider (1994).
Data Gridding and Contouring The areal digital database was created from gridded data based on the two-way travel time
to individual reflectors, thickness of units in time, and interval velocities of these units. The skewed data spacing of dense data along widely-spaced seismic lines is not ideal for creating a gridded data set and unrealistic gridded and contoured data can easily result. The character of the resulting data is highly dependent upon the gridding technique used. In many cases, the results are not "right" or "wrong" but merely reflect the representation of the data given the assumptions built into the particular technique. The closely-spaced stratigraphic data were initially smoothed to the velocity data spacing shown in Figure 7 to reduce aliasing in the gridding stage. A minimum-curvature cubic-spline technique (Smith and Wessel, 1990) with a tension of zero was used on the data displayed in Appendix 3 to create a 5-minute grid of data. The resultant "scalloped" character of the contoured data displayed in Appendices 4 to 7 is an artifact of the minimum curvature assumption. No additional data constraints, based on assumed distributions of the data between seismic lines, have been added to the data. This would have "improved" the appearance of the contoured data, but it also would have given the false impression of better control than exists.
Data Masks The information portrayed in Appendices 4 to 8 for the individual surfaces or units have
regions where the data are missing or unknown. Regions of missing data are where erosion has removed the unit, or perhaps it was never deposited. The units have zero thickness in these regions, which are indicated by shaded regions without contours. If an erosional unconformity has cut deep enough to remove an underlying horizon in a given region, that surface contour map ( Appendices 4 and 5) has a shaded zone with no contours where the horizon is missing. This masking is consistent with the database construction used here, where surfaces refer to the bottom of units that exist. We have not attempted to construct composite surfaces that go across the entire margin, although this can be done with the information available in the digital database. There also are narrow zones within and beneath the carbonate bank shelf edge platform where the geoacoustic information is unknown. These zones are indicated by the blank region on all of the maps for units and surfaces below horizon 120.

U.S. Geological Survey Open File Report #94-637
Geological Influences on Geoacoustic Parameters Variations in geoacoustic properties on the margin are caused by a general increase in
density that results from an increasing depth of burial, by changes in the lithologies within and between the stratigraphic units, and by surficial and buried structures. The subdivision of the sedimentary wedge into a series of acoustic units separated by horizons or unconformities enables us to incorporate most of these variations into the database. The influence of depth of burial on interval velocities can be readily seen on all of the profiles in Appendix 3. Both these cross sections (top profiles in Appendix 3) and the depth-to-surface maps (Appendices 4 and 5) show the gradual seaward deepening of stratigraphic units beneath the shelf. The gradual increase in interval velocity across the shelf (see lower profiles in Appendix 3 and intervalvelocity contour maps in Appendix 7) are partially caused by the change in lithology from sandstone and shale to limestone and dolomite (lithologic maps in Appendix 8), but the primary cause is the increasing depth of burial.
Sedimentary structures, such as the carbonate shelf edge, prograding deltas, fans, salt diapirs, and rift basins, create a distinct velocity structure that may be faster or slower than adjacent sedimentary units and often more opaque to acoustic transmission. These features are incorporated into the database as general changes in lithologies (velocity), but they also could have significant influences on sound transmission because of their modes of construction. The chaotic character of the carbonate bank (Figure 5) creates an acoustic barrier that is difficult to penetrate with seismic techniques. As a result, the underlying units are usually masked on seismic-reflection data and we can say little about their acoustic properties. The blank areas near the shelf edge for units beneath the Upper Jurassic unit is caused by this acoustic masking. Attempts to see through this zone with larger offset receivers such as in the LASE experiment (Keen and others, 1986) have met with some success, but there is a significant loss in resolution and such experiments are very expensive. Prograding fans and deltas are particularly important geologic units in the Cretaceous and Tertiary sections of the margins (Figures 6 and 13)(Poag, 1992). On seismic lines (e.g., see the Tertiary section on Figure 6), the lobate shape of these fans and deltas creates a suite of undulating stratigraphic packets of coalescing sedimentary structures. Distinct lithologic variations associated with grain-size partitioning of sediment within a single delta or fan can create small, but distinctive velocity anomalies. The extensive fan/delta systems found in the upper 1 km of the sedimentary section on the northern U.S. shelf and rise make them some of the most important geologic features on the margin. Although these small variations can not be resolved in this data set, an understanding of the velocity structure of these systems represents an important objective of any high-resolution velocity study for acoustic transmission.
The modification of sedimentary units by erosion can significantly modify acoustic signatures. The erosion of the seaward edge of geologic units by fluctuations in sea level has created "holes" in the acoustic information for many of the Cretaceous and Tertiary units. On the shelf and rise, these erosional holes (indicated by masked regions on the maps in Appendices 4-8) are actually regions where significant lithologic discontinuities can exist. Causes of these discontinuities include the juxtaposition of younger, less lithified strata, over significantly older strata that was at one time buried to a greater depth. The unconformity can juxtapose units deposited in significantly different environments. Canyons cut into the continental slope create a chaotic pattern of steep-sided structures that can diffract substantial amounts of acoustic energy. This chaotic pattern results in a very low coherence in the RMS velocity analyses in this region and causes some of the scatter displayed on the contour maps. In general,
13

U.S. Geological Survey Open File Report #94-637
the continental slope (both past and present day) represents of zone of poorly defined acoustic character.
Faulting has deformed sedimentary units in two distinctive zones. The deep synrift sections are cut by numerous faults (Klitgord and others, 1988), but most of these sections are beneath the region of reliable velocity analyses for our data. In the shallower postrift sedimentary sections there are two sources of faulting. Failure under sediment loading has created a series of large faults near the shelf edge that parallel the margin (Figure 3). These faults are partially localized by load failure as the continental shelf edge prograded over the older continental slope. This set of faults has been called the Gemini Fault system by Poag (1985b, 1987; 1991). Faulting and uplift of sedimentary units are associated with the rise of salt diapirs and the intrusion of igneous bodies during the Mid-Cretaceous. The Schlee Dome in northern Baltimore Canyon Trough (Poag, 1987; Grow and others, 1988) is the largest of these intrusive features. There is extensive faulting along the southeastern edge of Georges Bank where the intrusive bodies did not rise as high into the sedimentary wedge, but the faulting around them does extend into the Upper Cretaceous section. This fracturing and subsequent crack-filling can significantly modify the local velocity structure. Such variations are below the resolution of this study, but shallow fault systems have the potential for distorting transmission paths.
Geoacoustic Database Displays
The digital geoacoustic database is portrayed in cross-section perspective on the seismicreflection profiles in Appendix 3 and in map perspective in Appendices 4 to 8. The map perspectives are based on the information related to individual surfaces (horizons) or to the unit just above each surface (see Figures 9 and 10). Therefore, there is a separate map for each of the surfaces or units in the database (see Table 4) based on data from all of the seismic lines in Appendix 3.
Multichannel Seismic-Reflection Profiles (Appendix 3) All of the seismic-reflection profiles used in this data set are included in Appendix 3. The
locations of these lines are shown on Figures 3 and 7. Most of the profiles (lines 1-38, I POD, and 77-1, 77-2) were acquired by commercial firms under contract to the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) in the 1970's. Two lines (BGR-79-202 and 79-204) were acquired by the German Geological Survey as part of a cooperative with USGS. Detailed discussions of these seismic data and their stratigraphic analyses are given by Poag (1985b, 1987, 1991, 1992), Grow and others (1988), Sheridan and others (1988), and Schlee and Klitgord (1988). Line crossing and well-crossing locations are given in Appendix 1 and labelled across the top of each profile. The time section (two-way travel time vs shot point distance) and the interval velocities for each stratigraphic unit (vs shot point distance) on this time section are displayed for each of these lines. All dip sections are plotted from northwest to southeast. All strike sections are plotted from southwest to northeast. The corresponding reflector number for each horizon or unit (Table 4) is labelled at each end of the profiles and at appropriate locations along the profile. On each time section the upper-most reflector is the sea floor (reflector 1). The bottom-most labelled reflector varies across the margin, but on most profiles it is the postrift unconformity or oceanic basement. Stratigraphic units and structures beneath the postrift unconformity and faults are plotted, but not labelled on the profiles. There is no velocity information associated with these latter features, therefore, they have not been
14

U.S. Geological Survey Open File Report #94-637
incorporated into the digital database. The interval velocities have been smoothed, using a contouring technique described by Klitgord and Schneider (1994). The locations of original velocity information are indicated by the x's. The velocity profiles are plotted with increasing velocity values (in m/sec) going down. In this way, the relative positions of reflectors and the velocity curves associated with the unit above each reflector are the same; in general, the lowermost velocity curve (i.e., highest velocity) corresponds to the deepest numbered horizon in the time section.
Depth to Reflectors in Time (Appendix 4) and Distance (Appendix 5) The contoured surface depths of individual reflectors (horizons), in seconds two-way
travel time or in meters, portray the expected increasing depth to older reflectors at any given location. The area! variations in depth, however, are best seen on the depth in meters surfaces in Appendix 5. The distortion in two-way travel time surfaces (Appendix 4) caused by vertical variations in velocity creates a surface dominated by the shape of the sea floor. Two of the most distinctive characters of the surface contours in Appendix 5 are the shifts in the location (and vertical relief) of the continental slope and the more extensive erosion found in the Georges Bank and Long Island Platform regions relative to the Baltimore Canyon Trough. The shifts in the location of the shelf edge and changes in the depth of the continental rise relative to the shelf are a consequence of shifting sediment supply, sea-level variations and the effectiveness of the shelf-edge barrier trapping sediment on the shelf. The pattern of eroded units concentrated around Georges Bank is caused by: 1.) the basement hinge zone being farther offshore than in the region of the Baltimore Canyon Trough; 2.) the slower subsidence of the Georges Bank region relative to the Baltimore Canyon Trough; and 3.) a smaller terrigenous sediment supply to the Georges Bank region. Sediment distribution patterns onshore west of the Baltimore Canyon Trough (which is landward of the basement hinge zone) show thinning or absence of Jurassic units similar to that found on the Long Island Platform and along the northern edge of Georges Bank basin. The greater subsidence rate in the Baltimore Canyon Trough was probably caused by a combination of greater sediment influx (loading) (Poag, 1991) as well as a more extensive modification of the rift-stage crust (Klitgord and others, 1988). Because Georges Bank Basin had a slower subsidence rate than the Baltimore Canyon Trough (Sawyer and others, 1983), the sedimentary units on the shelf were thinner and more likely to be completely eroded by a drop in sea level. Several of the reflectors are found only in the centers of the two basins. This occurs because the depocenters also are the regions of greatest subsidence rate across the margin, and thus the most likely zone for preserving material during sea level falls.
Isopachs of Acoustic Units (Appendix 6) Isopach maps of stratigraphic units in the database provide a much clearer image of the
deposition and erosion patterns on the margin (Poag, 1991, 1992) than that provided by the depth maps (Appendices 4 and 5). These maps show that there is almost no Tertiary sediment on Georges Bank Basin, but extensive deposition on the adjacent continental rise; sediment was bypassing the bank. The Mid-Miocene was the only period of major Cenozoic sediment accumulation in the Baltimore Canyon Trough region. The Tertiary was, in general, a period of major sediment influx to the continental rise (Poag, 1992). In contrast, the Jurassic was a period of major accumulation on both the shelf and rise. The depocenters during the Cretaceous appear to have straddled the older continental slope, as extensive terrigenous material prograded over the older platform complex and filled the adjacent continental rise. The shelfrise transition was more gradual at this time, with major deltas and fans covering the margin (e.g., Figure 12).

Interval Velocities (Appendix 7) Interval velocity patterns are dominated by the depth of burial influence mentioned
previously. There are general velocity increases across the margin as well as smaller wavelength changes along the margin. The latter features correspond to major fans or deltas. Of note are the similar velocities in both Georges Bank Basin and Baltimore Canyon Trough for the Middle Jurassic deposits, despite the considerably greater depth of the Baltimore Canyon Trough units. This similarity may be a result of the sediments reaching a limit to their density increase at low temperatures or may be caused by the higher dolomite and anhydrite content in the lower section of the Georges Bank Basin. These maps also reaffirm the observation that on Georges Bank there are higher velocity sedimentary units at shallow depth than to the south.
Sediment Types (Appendix 8) The sediment types for the various units are estimates based on the limited distribution of
subsurface samples and seismic character evaluations (Poag, 1982, 1985b, 1991, 1992). Terrigenous fluxes of sand (s), sand and silt (s/s) and clay (c) dominate the Tertiary, with a minor phase of carbonate (carb) along the outer shelf during the early Tertiary. A similar pattern dominates the Cretaceous, with more extensive deep sea shales (sh) forming during the mid-Cretaceous. The Jurassic shelf edge is dominated by limestone accumulation from active shelf-edge reefs. Sand and silt filled the shelf behind the reef while pelagic shale mixed with lobes of terrigenous sands formed the continental rise. Changes in the upland sources of sediment caused along-shelf variations in sediment type (from sand/silt to clay), as the locus of delta and fan formation shifted (Poag and Sevon, 1989).
Summary:
The geoacoustic database constructed from multichannel seismic-reflection profiles and well data on the northern U.S. Atlantic margin provides the ability to investigate the threedimensional acoustic character of the continental margin and its variation since the Middle Jurassic (187 m.a.). Both the isopach and interval-velocity patterns for individual acoustic units incorporated into this database display variations reflecting the depositional and erosional history of the margin and the distribution of major sedimentary features such as deltas, fans, and a carbonate-bank, shelf-edge platform. Geoacoustic consequences of the stratigraphic and velocity patterns incorporated in the database include: 1.) A general monotonic increase in velocities with depth on all parts of the margin. The increase in depth to reflectors and increasing overburden of geologic units creates a general increase in V rms, Vj, V s, and p across the shelf to the continental slope. Velocity inversions are known to exist from well log data (Klitgord and Schneider, 1994), but they can not be resolved with the multichannel seismic data used in this study. 2.) The erosion of portions of geologic units can cause some abrupt changes in transmission properties, bringing lower-velocity units into direct contact with higher-velocity units. This phenomenon will influence the refracted seismic energy in terms of abrupt changes in distant arrival times and the reflected seismic signal in terms of abrupt increases in reflected energy amplitudes. The presence of relatively high-velocity material at a shallow depth (<500 m) just south of Long Island is a consequence of either erosion or nondeposition of Tertiary material in the Long Island Platform and Georges Bank regions. 3.) Prograding deltas, overlapping fans, and faulting associated with mega-slumping at the shelf edge represent a set of geologic features in the upper sedimentary wedge of the margin (<1000 m) that may have a significant influence on acoustic transmission patterns.

Appendix 3 Stratigraphic Time Sections and Layer Interval Velocity Sections The upper profile (time section) for each line is the seismostratigraphic base displayed in terms of two-way travel time (in seconds) vs distance along track (shot points). Each numbered surface corresponds to one of the seismostratigraphic units listed in Table 4. The upper most surface is the sea floor (reflector 1). Un-numbered lines crossing diagonally through the sedimentary section are interpreted faults. Un-numbered lines beneath the numbered Stratigraphic section are basement structures or synrift strata. They are provided as a guide to the general nature of geologic features beneath the geologic units in the data base, but they are not included in the gridded database. The lower profile for each line displays the interval velocity for the Stratigraphic units shown in the upper profile. These velocities are the final, smoothed functions derived from the ISM smoothed RMS velocity data. Velocities increase going down the page, with highest velocities at the bottom. Average water velocity has been assumed 1500 m/sec. Note the general increase in velocities in the seaward direction across the shelf. This change is primarily associated with the greater depth of burial of the units. Each velocity curve is numbered and corresponds to the unit directly above the same numbered surface listed in Table 4 and show in the upper profile. The x's indicate the locations of velocity analyses.

Appendix 4 Time Depth Contour Maps for the Base of Acoustic Units in Digital Database Surface contour maps of the two-way travel times to the base of each acoustic unit in this geoacoustic database. The dotted lines represent the seismic line control used to construct each surface. See Figure 8 for the 5-minute grid point map, based on these seismic lines, used to construct the contour map. Shaded masks indicate the regions where a particular surface has been eroded into by an overlying surface. Narrow blank zones in the shelf-edge region are where deeper units are obscured by the Jurassic carbonate bank. Contour interval is 0.2 sec in two-way travel times.

Appendix 7 Interval Velocity Contour Maps for Acoustic Units in Digital Database Contour maps of the interval velocities of each acoustic unit in this geoacoustic database. The dotted lines represent the seismic line control used to construct each surface. See Figure 8 for the 5-minute grid point map, based on these seismic lines, used to construct the contour map. Shaded masks indicate the regions where a particular surface has been eroded into by an overlying surface. Narrow blank zones in the shelf edge region are where deeper units are obscured by the Jurassic carbonate bank. Water velocity (reflector 1) is assumed 1500 m/sec. Contour interval is 100 m/sec.

Hi Carolyn-
I have paper copies and will put a copy of each in the mail to you tomorrow.
Thank you also for explaining the format and resolution rquired for scans to be converted to djvue. I'll keep that in mind as I stumble over other pubs, particularly open-file;
Thanks, Nancy Soderberg

Subject Inquiry from Pubs Contact Form

Hi PW-- i have just located 2 open-file reports produced by people in this office (Marine Geology-Woods Hole Science Center) that aren't in the library catalog nor in the libraries and not at Denver Distribution. They have an ofr# and are paper. Is it possible to get them directly into PW using djvu. 1 can scan with my desktop creating pdf but I can't create your standard format. John Watson suggested I contact you directly to see if they can be scanned> I don't know if I still need to send multiple copies to Penny Burnworth to get them into the library catalog. Klitgord, K.D., and Schneider, C.M., 1994, Geophysical database of the east coast of the United States northern Atlantic margin: Velocity analyses: USGS Open-file Report 94-192, 74 p. Klitgord, K.D., Poag, C.W., Schneider, C.M., and North L., 1994, Geophysical database of the east coast of the United States northern Atlantic margin: Cross sections and gridden database (Georges Bank Basin, Long Island Platform, and Baltimore Canyon Trough): USGS Open-file Report 94-637, 189 p. Thanks, Nancy Soderberg nsoderberg@usgs.gov WHSC Data Library/Archive

Nancy,
Thank you for the verification of these publications - we had been unable to find complete citations for them and that is why they were not available to the public. I have now updated them and the citations should be available on the public site tomorrow.
If you have extra paper copies that you do not mind being destroyed (we cut the binding off to scan them) then copies can be sent to:
USGS Legacy Reports Project USGS/Cartography and Publishing Program 505 Science Drive Madison, Wl 53711
We would take care of scanning them and getting them posted at the Pubs Warehouse. If you don't have paper copies but would be able to photocopy the reports, that would be fine too.
Otherwise, if you would like to scan them, we have been requesting that people scan to the following specifications:
400 dots per inch Not interpolated (true optical) TIFF format - uncompressed
(not group-4 TIFF as is produced from many scanners) Grayscale or 24-bit color, depending on original material Single-page TIFFs
We can take PDF format and convert it to DJVU but would prefer one of the above options because we are archiving raw files at CAPP and sending copies to the national archive so that as the technology changes we can always reprocess the raw files.
Please let me know if you have any questions.
Thank you,
Carolyn
