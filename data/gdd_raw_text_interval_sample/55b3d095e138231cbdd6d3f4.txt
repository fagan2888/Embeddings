THE KAIPAROWITS REGION
A GEOGRAPHIC AND GEOLOGIC RECONNAISSANCE OF PARTS OF UTAH AND ARIZONA

By HERBERT E. GREGORY and RAYMOND C. MooRE

INTRODUCTION
HISTORY AND SCOPE OF INVESTIGATIONS
In their traverse of the Colorado River and of the rim of the I-Iigh Plateaus the members of the Powell Survey outlined a large area between the Henry Mountains and the. I\:aibab Plateau within which the 1\:aipa,rowits Plateau is the dominating feature. Difficulty of access, dry climate, scant vegetation, small water supplies, and complete absence of human population prevented a study of this region under the conditions then prevailing, and the trappers and prospectors who preceded and followed these early explorers were little interested in making detailed examinations of the sandstones that constitute most of the bedrock. Largely for these reasons the Kaiparowits region has long remained geologically unknown, and probably parts of it at least have been seen by white n1en only within the last 10 years. Geologic surveys within this unmapped area were needed for correlating the formations and structure with those in surrounding areas, and it seemed desirable tq know more of the physical features-the soil, water, climate, and vegetation-as a guide in determining the use to which this area of largely unappropriated land might be put. Furthermore, the very fact that the existing knowledge of the region was 1neager made a strong appeal.
'\Vith these ideas in mind field work designed to cover those parts of southeastern Utah that had not been examined by scientific parties was begun by Gregory in 1915. During that year a pack-train traverse was made from Lees Ferry along the north wall of Glen Canyon and thence northeastward across the I\:aiparowits Plateau, through a region unmarked by trails. From the head of Collett Wash the traverse was continued to .Escalante, where supplies and additional horses were obtained, thence down the Escalante River, across the W aterpocket Fold, and through the Henry Mountains to the mouth of Trachyte Creek, where the Colorado was crossed by swimming the horses and ferrying the equipment on a makeshift raft.

~fountain. The purposes of this exploration-to determine routes, to locate water holes, and to select areas where detailed geologic study could profitably be undertaken-were successfully accomplished. It v.-as found that the stratigraphic formations previously mapped in the Navajo country extended with little change throughout southeastern Utah.
During the summer of 1918 the exploratory survey by Gregory was continued. Arter leaving Green River, Utah, on May 2, three weeks was spent in the study of stratigraphic sections at Temple '\Vash (San Rafael Swell), Pleasant Valley, Tantalus Valley, and along the Waterpocket Fold to the Colorado River at the mouths of Halls and Hanson Creeks. After crossing the '\Vaterpocket Fold at Muley Twist, the next five weeks was devoted to an investigation of the physiography and stratigraphy of the Escalante Valley, the rim of Glen Canyon, and the Kaiparowits Plateau · and the examination of the geologic features of th.e Paria, Wahweap,. and '\Varm Creek Valleys at places not previously visited. In 1922, after completing investigations in the Kanab and Parunaweap Valleys, Gregory and L. F. Noble extended their geologic traverse of Nevada and western Utah to include the Paria Valley and the south side of the Kaiparowits Plateau: The top and the east end of the Kaiparowits Plateau were examined, and sections were measured at Canaan Peak, Henrieville, and Tropic. In 1924 Gregory spent two weeks in a study of Mesozoic and Tertiary strata along the eastern tributaries of the Paria River, and in 1925 and 1927 he extended the survey eastward across Glen Canyon to correlate 'the geographic and geologic features of the 1\:aiparowits region with those of southeastern Utah and southwestern Colorado.
Because of the possibility that the Circle Cliffs region might contain oil pools, Moore was assigned to stratigraphic and structural studies in this part of southern Utah for three months in the summer. of 1921. Assisted by A. C. Tester and P. C. Benedict, 4e rnapped the Circle Clift's dome, a part of the Straight Cliffs front, the Harris Valley southeast of Escalante, and the Halls Valley from Muley Twist Creek to the Colorado River.

precise though rapid geologic and structural mapping, numerous stratigraphic sections were measured and some fossils were collected. A reconnaissance study was· rriade of the Tertiary and Mesozoic formations north of Kanab, where the party outfitted, of the Kaibab. Plateau southward to the rim of the Grand Canyon, and along the route across the Paunsaugunt Plateau to Tropic and Henrieville in the upper Paria Valley and to Escalante by way of the road south of the Table Cliff Plateau. A trip was made from the lower Halls Creek Valley to the point on the Colorado River where the Waterpocket Fold reached Glen Canyon. In the later part of the field season a small area of coal land was studied in . southern Wayne County on the northwest slope of Mount Ellen, the most· northerly and highest of the peaks in the Henry Mountains. After passing through the Pleasant Valley and Capitol Reef Wash the party · proceeded by way of Fruita and Loa to Richfield.
Beginning early in June, 1922, Moore's work was continued in the Kaiparowits region, with the primary object of classifying a large territory in southcentral Garfield and eastern Kane Counties that had been withdrawn as possible coal land. A. C. Tester and N. W. Bass were assistants. In general the work was similar to that of the previous year, but in addition a reconnaissance topographic map was prepared. (See pl. 1.) · Investigations were. directed chiefly to the Cretaceous rocks of the Kaiparowits Plateau and a part of the upper Paria Valley, but the older and younger rocks were studied and mapped throughout most of the region. Field work terminated September 7.
In July, 1923, as geologist o£ the party engaged in rnapping the Colorado River in the Grand Canyon, Moore had opportunity to study the rock formations in the Lees Ferry area.
Although the work of Gregory was primarily a geographic and stratigraphic reconnaissance, and that o£ Moore consisted of basic studies for possible future · economic development, the conditions that governed the work permitted both investigators to make observations relating to all subdivisions of geology. Partsof the area were studied by both geologists. Under· these circumstances the results of the field studies may properly appear as a single report under joint authorship.
The authorship of the paper has been divided as follows : Chapter 1 and the sections on the Triassic, Jurassic, and Tertiary in chapter 2 have been written mainly by Gregory. Chapter 3 R.nd the sections on the pre-

Triassic and Cretaceous in chapter 2 have been written mainly by Moore, and the base map, geologit; map, structure map, and geologic sections have been prepared under his direction. Chapters 4 and 5 represent a combination of manuscripts by both authors. This subdivision of work has been adopted for convenience only. The authors share responsibility equally for the observations recorded and the opinions expressed. ·
These investigations in the Kaiparowits region are by no means exhaustive. Much of the w6rk is reconnaissance-some o:f it exploratory-but the text and maps should fairly well present the major :features o:£ the geography and geology o:£ this interesting part o:£ the Colorado plateau~.

PREVIOUS WORK
After the termination o:£ the Powell and Wheeler surveys (see p. 7) a quarter o:£ a century passed before the region that borders Glen Canyon became a field for geologic study. . In 1900 a party consisting o:£ Tempest Anderson, R. L. Barrett, W. M. Davis, Richard E. Dodge, and Herbert E. Gregory visited Lees Ferry on their way from Flagstaff, Ariz., to Toquerville, Utah.· Studies made by them o:£ the physiographic features o:£ Echo Cliffs and the Paria Plateau are recorded by Davis.1 Lees Ferry was again visited by Johnson 2 and Shimer 8 in 1906.
In 1913 Lawson' published a paper on the economic aspects o:£ the " Shinarump clays " (Chinle formation o:£ present nomenclature) near the settlement o:£ Paria, and brief notes on the coal at Escalante and Warm Creek and the placer gold along Glen Canyon have appeared in engineering and mining journals. With these exceptions, no geologic studies had been made in· the Kaiparowits region prior to the field work on which the present report is based. On the borders of the area exploratory surveys and detailed reconnaissance surveys had been made, and for a large part of the area the atlas sheets o:£ the Wheeler and Powell surveys, which indicate the supposed extension eastward o:£ the geologic :formations represented in ·the High Plateaus, are available.

Lake.

It is difficult to picture the motives that led Escalante

to tak_e this extremely circuitous route. He may have

been Influenced by current rumors of a great river

north and east of Monterey, which might. lead him

to the California coast, and by vague accounts of tribes

and villages north of Tusayan, but a reading of the

Diario gives the impression that,zeal for exploration,

the pure joy of seeing unknown lands and unknown

people, exerted a strong influence. Whatever the rea-

sons that brought Escalante's party to the west base

of the Wasatch, it was evident to the leader that fur-

ther travel to the north and west would lead away

from his prospectiv~ goal. He therefore turned south,

crossing streams leading from the mountains. Find-

ing that the Indians knew nothing of roads to the

sea or to the contemplated

with keen regret and the decision reached to return

to Santa Fe through the Moqui villages. This deci-

sion necessitated crossing the Colorado and long jour-

ne!s throu~~ unknown lands. With the scant sup-

phes remaining, supplemented by seeds and pifion

nuts, the party. made their way along the base of the

Wasatch to the Virgin River, thence eastward. from

the vicinity of St. George, heading canyons, crossing

plateaus, following dry valleys, and finally reaching

the Colorado September 26. After a 12 days' search

fo: a possible crossing among the cliffs and sharply cut

tributary gorges of Marble Gorge and Glen Canyon,

an old Indian ford was found at the point since known

as the Crossing of the Fathers. The route southeast

from the ·crossing presented no great difficulties, and

the party reached Oraibi November 16, 1776, and Zu:fi.i

January 2, 1777. The traverse of the plateaus and

gorges _north of Grand and Glen Canyons and the

crossing of the river is perhaps the most difficult

undertaking credited to the intrepid Spanish padres.

The Hurricane Cliffs and Kanab Canyon are formi-

?able obstacles, and from the Paria eastward the region

Is desolate and abandoned even by Indians· it is a
" no man's land" that separates the Utes f'rom the

roving Navajos. Access to the Crossing of the Fathers

is through a narrow gorge, down precipitous slopes,

and crossing is feasible only at low water or on ice

during abnormal win~ers. (See pl. 4, 0.) Lieutenant

Marshall,9 who in 1872 found the ford but did not

cross, described the .region as " one of remarkable

grandeur and almost unique in its loneliness." So far

as known Escalante was the first white man to traverse

southern Utah and the only explorer to enter Glen

Canyon before Powell's memorable traverse, nearly a

century later.

THE TRAPPERS

During the second and third decades of the nine-

teenth century trappers and fur traders crossed the

Rockies and pushed their way into the Valley of the

Colorado, but their wanderings, which mark a note-

worthy period in western e:xploration added nothin0' to the knowledge of southern Utah. 'After the ovf~rb-

thr<;>w of Spanish power in 1821, a few traders ex-

tended their operations westward from Santa Fe pPr-

haps as far as the lower San Juan, and Chittenden 10

expresses the belief tha,t in 1824 William trapper, wintered on the Colorado below

of the Green River. The Mission Fur Co. and its sue-

. cessor, the American Fur Co., operated chiefly within

the Mis~ouri River Basin.. The business of the Rocky

Mountain Fur Co. centered on the Upper Green River

in Wyoming and extended westward to Salt Lake

and northwestward into Idaho.

Camps and ·winter quarters were established on the

streams of the Uinta Mountains and on the Grand

River, and parties were at work along the Colorado be-

low Camp Mojave. The intervening stretch of about

1600 miles was unmolested. It offered few attractions

to the trappers. It was not beaver country nor buffalo

range.. The river "could not be approached," its

bordering country was" desolate,"" desert," and trav-

ersed by "impassable chasms." Little food was to

be obtained, and few Indians were there to be robbed.

The fur hunters _were interested in beavers, not

scenery. Wit who in 1826 m

the great river between the mouth of the Green and

the mouth of the Virgin. Pattie's narrative is a fas-

POWELL AND WHEELER SURVEYS
During 1867, 1868, and 1869 Maj. J. W. Powell was engaged in general scientific exploration in western Colorado and eastern Utah under the a-uspices of the Smithsonian Institution. While engaged in this work he made the memorable trip down the Green and Colorado Rivers. Leaving Green River, Wyo., the old Indian crossing, May 24, 1869, Gl:mnison's crossing of 1853, now Green River, Utah, was passed July 13, the mouth of the Green River July 18, the Dirty Devil 14 (now Fremont) July 28, the San Juan July 31, and the Little Colorado August 10. This -extraordinary journey ended August 30 at the mouth ·of the Virgin River. The course of the Colorado from the n1outh of the Green River to the mouth of the 'Virgin was covered in 23 days, a distance of 539 miles, more than 23 miles a day. The task of getting the boats along, overcoming obstacles, procuring food, .and recording distances and directions left little time ·Ol' energy for scientific observations beyond the immediate river banks. As stated by ~owell: 15

Our lust trip was so hurried, owing to the loss of rations, nnd the scientific instruments were so badly injured that we were not satisfied with the results obtained, so we shall once more attempt to pass through the canyons in boats, devoting two or three years to the trip.
Although the scientific results were meager, this first traverse of the Colorado brought an end to the ·fantastic stories of swiftly revolving whirlpools, long underground passages, and plunging waterfalls. It proved that the river could be navigated by daring souls with less difficulty and perhaps less danger than is involved in traversing its banks across waterless tributary canyons and along dry cliffs perched thousands of feet above the stream. As expressed by the Piutes, the god Tav-woats had made the Colorado .gorges as a trail across the arid lands and when ·later that trail was closed by sending a mighty stream to <>ccupy it, no route to the beautiful land to the west remained.
To obtain fuller knowledge of the region obviously required more time, and this involved stores of provisions suitably placed along the river route. With

these ideas in mind, Powell returned to Utah in 1870

and from headquarters on the upper Kanab explored

the canyons of the Virgin and the Uinkaret Plateau,

investigated a trail to the bottom of the canyon near

Toroweap, and on his return crossed the river at the

mouth of the Paria on a ferryboat built of lumber

brought from ICanab. After consulting with the in-

dispensable Mormon scout, Jacob Hamblin, it was

decided to have supplies taken by pack train to the

mouth of the Uinta, the mouth of the Dirty Devil,

the Ute ford (Crossing of the Fathers), and the mouth

of the Paria.

·

This second expedition left Green River, Wyo., May

22, 1871, and the mouth of the Green River Septenl-

ber 19. Inability of the pack train to reach the mouth

of the Dirty Devil with provisions compelled the

expedition to abandon one boat and to hasten the

journey to the Crossing of the Fathers, where supplies

had been cached. The party continued to the mouth

of the Paria and thence to l(anab for winter quarters.

Powell left the river party at the Crossing of the

Fathers, followed the ·Ute trail to Paria, and pro-

ceeded to Salt Lake City. He thus became the first

geologist to traverse the southwest base of the Kai-

parowits Plateau.

The plan to recover the boat left at the mouth of

the Dirty Devil led to the first examination of the

upper tributaries of the Paria, the headwaters of the

Escalante, the Waterpocket Fold, and the Henry

Mountains. Starting from l(anab in ~1ay, 1872, nine

men in charge of ·A. H. Thompson made their way

up to Johnson Canyon through Swallow Park and

along the .base of the Paunsaugunt Plateau, where

Thompson says:

Travel was exceedingly slow and difficult. Our progress was often barred by a canyon, along whose brink we were compelled to follow till some broken-down slope afforded a way to descend, then up or down the canyon until another broken slope permitted us to ascend, then across a mesa to another canyon, repeating the maneuver a dozen times in half that number of miles.

The Paria was reached near the mouth of Yellow
Creek and the traverse continued to the head of Table Cliff Creek [Henrieville Creek] .

Here we climbed 1,000 feet up a steep clay ridge having an average slope of 20° and often not more than 5 feet [wide] at the top to the head of a narrow valley called Potato Valley [Upper Valley, a branch of the Escalante]. Down this we traveled 3 mi~es and made Camp 6 at a cool spring in the midst of a beautiful meadow.

From this camp at the base of the towering pink precipices of the Table Cliff Plateau, now the site of summer ranches, Thompson 16 studied the surrounding country. He sayR:

Powell's parties of 1869, 1871, or 1872. , In fact, Wheeler ignores the work done by all the parties of the Powell Survey.
In 1874 Thompson, assisted by W. H. Graves and J. H. Renshawe, completed 1naps of the Aquarius Plateau and the northe1:n tributaries of the Escalante and extended the survey to the Henry Mountains.
The following information regarding exploration and mapping in 1875 has been given by F. S. Dellenbaugh: :.:!!
I have .Thompson':S diary of the trip 1:1e made in 1875. Their supply camp this season was on the southeast side of Rabbit Valley. Gilbert started for the Henry Mountains on August 12, 1875. Thompson went to a camp about 12 miles above Paria settlement, then to a point about 3 miles below the " old settlement," then to a camp in Sentinel Rock [Wahweap] Creek " \vnsh," about 20 miles. He had difficulty in finding the trail, showing that he was on one which was probably the El Vado trail, and he went to this place [El Vado] the next day. Then he went to \Varm Creek, then to a point below Pul'ia settlement ugain, then back to Panguitch, whence he had come some few clays before. Earlier he was in •.rantalus Valley (July 19) and worked his way to the slopes of the Aquarius, camping on July 20 at what we called Mosquito Cnmp in 1872 because we were eaten alive there on a rainy Bight. He then went to Boulder Creek, to head of Potato Creek, to ll'alse Creek [Harris wash], and to Last Chance Creek [Collett ·wash], arriving at this last on July 28, 1875.
On August 2, he was at his camp 26. " Gilbert, Graves, Jnck [Hillers], and myself started for the end of the Kaiparowits Plateau. Came about 25 miles down the valley, climbed the first bench and up about 350 feet of the second, when we came to a place we could not get over. "''orked on it and got the mule, Net, up.

"'Vecluesclny, August 4 * • *. It took us about two
hours to get clown 900 feet of the first cliff, and our camp was some 6 miles from the comedown. \Ve reached our camp of the 3d instant about 9.30 a. m. Reached camp at 5 p. m."
They then went on back from this camp on Last Chance Creek to a camp on Pine Creek a mile above its junction with the Escalante. "Saw Mormons from Panguitch, who are tnlking about making a settlement here. Advised them to call the plnce Escnlnnte."
Thompson went out then across the Aquarius Plateau to the supply cmnp.
The work of the Powell Survey in the l(aiparowits region resulted in a reconnaissance topographic map on a scale of about 4 miles to the inch with a contour interval of 250 feet, published by the United States Geological Survey as the Henry ~1ountains, Escalante, Echo Cliffs, and l(anab maps.

prepared by the Geological Survey, in 1921, these sheets have constituted the sole available information regarding the topography and drainage of this region. They present in bold. outline the dominant features and admirably portray. the quality of relief, but outside of the routes traversed by Thompson and prominent features visible from easily accessible viewpoints, the information they give is of little value as a guide to further explorations or as a base on which geologic data may be presented. The conditions that surrounded the work prohibited more than general re-
connaissance. The short stops n1ade by the river parties permitted only generalized observations along Glen Canyon and at the few, places where the canyon . wall could be scaled. ·The land parties likewise were hampered by lack of time. Thompson could give but eight days to a survey of the Escalante Valley and t~e 1\:aiparowits Plateau-about 3,000 square miles of intricately dissected and structurally complex country in which the relief exceeds 6,000 feet.
The geologic results of the early sur.veys may be summarized as follows :
Powell's trips down the Colorado canyons in 1869 and 1871 23 gave the first knowledge of the geologic features of Glen Canyon and its .immediate ·vicinity. Howell 24 in 1873 recorded observations on the stratigraphy and structure of the region between the base of the Aquarius Plateau and the Henry Mountains,
vVbriefly described the aterpocket and .Escalante
Folds, and measured a section in th~ upper Paria Val-. ley. Gilbert 25. in· connection with his study of the llenry Mountains, in 1875 and 1876, outlined the salient physiographic features of the Waterpocket flexure, the Escalante Basin, and the Kaiparowits Plateau. He ren1arks :
Two months would be far too short a period in which to survey a thousand square miles in Pennsylvania or Illinois, but among· the Colorado plateaus it proYecl sufficient. A few comprehensive views from mountain tops gave the general distribution of the formations, and the remainder of the time was spent in the examination of the localities which best displayed the peculiar features of the structure. So thorough was the display and so satisfactory the examination that in preparing my report I have felt less than ever before the desire to revisit the field and prove my conclusions by more extended observation.

plateau walls and canyons suggest that his conclusions were based on observations made at viewpoints on the Aquarius Plateau, many miles distant.
CROSSINGS OF THE COLORADO
Cliff dwellings are found on both sides of the Colorado River and also within its canyons, and probably the Pueblo tribes and later the· Navajos and Utes knew of· several crossings of the Colorado which they occasionally utilized. The known movements of warring Indian bands significantly coincides with times of low water or times when the river was frozen over. Old trails lead to the Colorado at its junction with the Green, at the mouth of the Ljttle Colorado, and down Bright Angel and Shinumo Creeks. Supai informants state that crossings by means of rudely constructed rafts were made at Grand Wash, at the mouth of the Virgin, and at points on the lower Colorado. The Spanish explorers, trappers, and hunters were familiar with the long-used ford at Green River, Utah, which was recommended by Gunnison (1853 ~) as a route for a railroad and later was utilized by the Denver & Rio Grande Railroad. The ancient Ute ford, now known as the Crossing of the Fathers, was rediscovered by Escalante on his eventful journey from Utah Lake to the Hopi villages of Tusayan in 1776.
Systematic search for a feasible crossing of the Colorado was the result of missionary enterprise· of the Mormon Church. In 1858 the intrepid scout Jacob Hamblin
received instructions from President Brigham Young to take a company of men and visit the Moquis, or ·town Indians, on the east side of the Colorado River. The object of this visit was to learn something of the character and condition of this people and to take advantage of any opening there might be to preach the gospel to them and do them good.21
Leaving Santa Clara (near St. George) on October 28, the party of 12 men, including a Spanish interpreter (and a Welsh interpreter !) , proceeded by way of " Yellow Rocks Springs " (Pipe Springs),
traversed the canyons and plateaus eastward, and after climbing dangerous cliffs and crossing extensive fissures in the rocks, the tenth day out fro:p1 home we crossed the Colorado River at the Ute ford known in Spanish history as the Cro~s­ ing of the Fathers.
The trail beyond was reported " not only difficult but sometimes very dangerous."
A second journey over this route was made in 1859, and a third in 1860, so timed as to cross the river at its low-water stage. The return from the uncompleted third trip, which was delayed by disastrous trouble with the Navajos, was accomplished in winter,
2'l Little, J. A., Jacob Hamblin, a narrative of his personal experience, 2d ed., p. 64, Salt Lake City, Deseret News, 1909.

and the crossing Is described by Hamblin 28 as follows:
Our route was a difficult one to travel in the winter season. The ford of the Colorado was deep and dangerous at any time but especially when the ice was running. Sometimes there were steep rocks to climb ; at othei.· times the trail ran along the almost perpendicular sides of deep rock fis::ures, narrow, with frequent short turns, where a misstep might plunge us or our animals hundreds of feet below.· Sometimes the precipitous rocks were covered with ice, which had to be hacked with our hatchets before we could feel any surety of a foothold.
At one time we waited until nearly midday for the sun to melt the frost and ice on a steep rock, that we might be able to get our animals out of a gulch onto the plain above. On this occasion my pack mule slipped and fell, then rolled and slid down to within about a yard of the edge of a chasm below.. We fastened a long lariat to the animal and saved it and the pack.
Its extreme difficulty and the hostility of the Navajos discouraged further use of the Glen Canyon crossing, but the project of converting the Hopis to the Mormon faith, though delayed, was not abandoned.
Explorations in southwestern Utah, which resulted in the settlement of St. George and of fertile spots in the Virgin and Santa Clara Valleys in 1861 encouraged the search for a crossing which might make possible the expansion of the settlements into northern Arizona and which did not involve the long, difficult route to the old Ute ford.
A feasible crossing was found at the mouth of the Grand Wash. By swimming the horses and transporting the luggage on a homemade boat Hamblin crossed the river at this point in 1862, traversed the Coconino Plateau, and proceeded along the base of the San Francisco Mountains and across the Little Colorado to Oraibi. This route was found to be so long and the water holes so small and so far apart that the return :from Oraibi was made over the old Ute trail. At the Crossing of the Fathers " fording was difficult and dangerous" but was successfully accomplished on New Year's Day, 1863, after the loss of eight horses.
On Hamblin's next visit to Tusayan, in 1863, the river was again crossed· at the foot of Grand Wash but at a place near the base of the Grand Wash Cliffs, the ~ite of Pierce Ferry (now abandoned). On returning from Oraibi by the same route in May, 1863, Hamblin reported : "We had explored a practicable though difficult route for a wagon from St. George to the Little Colorado." The length of this route and the scarcity of water west of the San Francisco Mountains ~ed Hamblin to try a new route, which he had previously reconnoitered, and in 1869 a successful crossing was made near the mouth of the Paria-the present Lees Ferry.

·with Ha~blin for a guide the Lees Ferry route was used by Powell in 1871 and by Lieutenants Hoxie and Marshall, of the Wheeler Survey in 1873. It has· be<!ome the establish~d line of travel from Utah to Arizona and is the only crossing available for wagons along the 788 mile~ of canyon betwe~n Green River, Utah, and Needles, Calif. The Crossing of the Ji'athers, always dangerous, is no longer practicable; a portion of the landing has been blasted away to block the route of marauding Navajos.
In 1870 southeastern Utah, comprising about onequarter of the State, was an unknown land. Powell had marked the course of the Colorado but found no feasible rQutes leading from it except those already known. Explorations by scouts of the Mormon Church had resulted in locating small tracts of irrigable land at the east base of the High Plateaus, along the Paria River, and at places south of the Colorado · ·canyons. Paria was founded in 1871, Cannonville and Escalante in 1875, and" about 20 families were living in Potato Valley " in 1878.
To these isolated settlements at the e1id of long roads leading across the jagged cliffs of the Iligh Plateaus cmne reports of good lands still farther east but separated from them by the impassable Glen Canyon. To confirm these reports an expedition was organized for the exploration of the San Juan Valley. In 1879 a party of 25 men under the leadership of Silas Smith crossed the Colorado at Lees Ferry and followed the 1narked trail through the Painted Desert to the Hopi village of Moenkopi. " Led by inspiration," the party reached Marsh Pass on the Navajo Reservation and, avoiding the canyon of the San Juan, made their way eastward to the mouth of Montezuma Creek. After exploring the San Juan Valley between 1\1cElmo Creek and Butler Wash and obtaining infor·mation from roving prospectors, the party turned northward to the Blue (Abajo) Mountains. Continuing along the base of the La Sal Mountains, they crossed the Colorado near the present town of Moab and followed the "Spanish trail" to Green River, Utah, and thence to Salt Lake City.
This expedition demonstrated that a route through the Navajo country from Escalante or Kanab to the San Juan Valley ~as impracticable. The country to be traversed consists of stretches of sandy flats alternating with areas of sharp-cut canyons; the water holes are far apart and the Navajos none too friendly; and even if a wagon road could be constructed and maintained, the distance, about 500 miles, is prohibitive. But the expedition also demonstrated that the San Juan Valley afforded opportunities for irrigation farming and that the Abajo and La Sal Mountains with their adjoining plateau lands were destined to become valuable grazing districts. It appeared that

the region east of Glen Canyon was " better country " than that immediately west.
The officials of the Mormon Church were favorably impressed by the report of Silas Smith, and with characteristic foresight they promptly issued a "call for the Saints to occupy the San Juan Valley." The president of the church was firmly convinced that "our people 'will want all the choice places where there is water and grass." But to occupy this faraway region was a serious undertaking. Its climate, its agricultural possibilities, and the attitude of the few Indians who made their home in the adjoining regions were little known. The proposed settlement could be reached only by the exhausting trails through Moenkopi and Marsh Pass or by the still longer Green River route. It was recognized that the interests of the church demanded that the pioneers in the proposed settlement have their commercial and religious associations with their brethren in the Utah villages· rather than with the gentiles of the Colorado mining towns; with Escalante rather than with Durango. With these ideas in mind, the prodigious task of constructing a wagon road from Escalante across Glen Canyon to the middle San Juan Valley was undertaken. After preliminary scouting on both sides of the canyon, a crossing was selected at the Hole in the Rock, at the lower end of the " SO-mile desert," 4 miles south of the mouth of the Escalante.
In October, 1879, a party led by Silas Smith, Platte Lyman, and .Jess Nielson, with a large number of workmen, horses, and wagons, was established in three camps, buildil}.g a road down the desert, collecting supplies, and assembling materials for a crude ferry boat. Between November 6 and December 29 about 70 miles of road was constructed, and early in J anuary 80 wagons, nearly 200 men and women, 50 children, 200 horses, and 1,000 cattle had reached the rim of the canyon. Work then centered on blasting the canyon walls and building a flat-bottomed boat about 9 feet wide and 28 feet long with planks brought from Escalante. The Colorado was crossed in February, and the emigrants laboriously made their way to Fort Montezuma, near the present Aneth, and later to the mouth of Cottonwood Creek, where Bluff City was established. On April 5, 1880, this settlement enrolled 225 pioneers, and the foundation was laid for the control of southeastern Utah and adjoining areas in Colorado. and New Mexico by adherents of the Mormon faith.
This crossing of the Colorado by the " San Juan missionaries" was a heroic undertaking. It is difficult enough for experienced men with a pack train; for parties that include women and children and loaded wagons it seems impossible.. Except for snow in winter, water is available only at nine places on

12 THE KAIPAROWITS REGION

the 215 miles of road, and at three of these places it is strongly alkaline.
From Escalante to the Hole in the Rock the route presents no extreme difficulties.. The "road" is of the sort common to southern Utah-a trail along which strongly built wagons may be dragged by 4, 6, or 8 horse teams under the guidance o£ experienced drivers and where progress is made by "hardening quicksands," removing talus blocks, cutting · "dugways,"" negotiating" sand dunes, and bumping along over knobs and sharp-cut depressions of extensive surfaces of bare rock. East of the Colorado the topography is forbidding. Short, box-headed tributaries lead from the river to the plateau above, and only at the rough, slippery "Clay Hill divide" is it feasible to cross the dissected uplands. .East of the "divide" are the deep canyons that lead to the San Juan, the rough south slopes of Elk Ridge, and the sharply •upturned rocks of Comb Wash.
The crossing itself is formidable. A break in the eanyon wall marks its west end-a mere slit in the towering cliffs of massive Navajo sandstone. No ca,nyon leads to it, and there is nothing in the surrounding topography to indicate its presence. It may now be found by tracing the· marks of wagon wheels across 8 miles of wind-swept rock. After entering the slit the "road" descends by passing through notches in the tops of projecting ledges, down across cliff-faced benches to a platform 600 feet 'below. The slit originally was a V-shaped groove, too narrow even for a· horse if the potholes and steps were absent from its bottom. At one place there is a shee.r 40-foot drop into a depression. By blasting rock and building out platforms and by the skillful use of logs brought from the Kaiparowits Plateau, a path was made down which single horses and men qn foot might make their way to the river. Wagons were taken apart and carried down on the backs of men and horses, .or lowered by ropes. Rusty ringbolts embedded in the cliffs and the remains of a roughly made windlass bear witness to the method employed.. Only necessity could induce one to take a horse down this trail; to descend on foot is a strenuous bit of exercise.
The impressions gained by a traverse of this first Escalante-Bluff City trail is confirmed by men who used it. Through the courtesy. of the historian of the Church of the Latter-day Saints, the unpublished reports of the San Juan mission have been examined. Like most accounts of men who do much and say little and to 'whom hardships are part of the daily routine, these reports to headquarters are brief and matter of fact, but they tell of horses lost and died, of grain exhausted, of accidents, of sickness, and of nearness to starvation. The parties east of the river especially seem to.have suffered. This crossing at the Hole in the Rock stands high in the list of pioneering

achievements for which Utah is famous, and it IS doubtful if anything but religious zeal would have made the undertaking possible. But, however difficult this route, there is no other place between Lees Ferry and the Waterpocket Fold where a crossing for wagons could lie established without expensive and carefully planned engineering operations. A packtrain traverse of the rim of Glen Canyon makes comprehensible the feeling of these missionary explorers that " We were led as if by inspiration to find the only possible route where a road could be made."
The disadvantages of the road by way of the Hole in the Rock led to the search for a practicable crossing farther upstream. Scouts from Escalante found that the Colorado could be approached without much difficulty at the mouth of Hall Creek, and in 1881 the dangerous Hole in the Rock .crossing was abandoned and the ferry .boat dragged by horses to a new sitethe present little-used Halls Crossing. The first connecting road from Escalante was marked out across Spencer Flat, down the " sand slide " into Escalante Canyon, arid along the canyon floor to the mouth of Silver Falls Creek. It continued up Silver Falls Creek and through Muley Twist Canyon in the Waterpocket Fold, thence down Halls Creek to the Colorado.
With the settlement of the upper Fremont Valley and of the lands about the Abajo Mountains, the need developed for a crossing of the Colorado that would not require the long journey down Halls Creek or t11e still longer journey by way of Green River and Moab. By this time also placer miners were at work on the Colorado, and their operations called for a place on the river to whic~ supplies could be brought either from Colorado towns or from Salt Lake City. In 1880 Dandy Crossing (Rite) was located near the mouth of Trachyte Creek, at a point where the canyon walls break down and an island midway in the current is exposed at low water. The crossings between Hite and Lees Ferry are utilized occasionally by scientific parties, prospectors, and stockmen, but Glen Canyon remains the same barrier across lines of travel that was encountered by the Spaniard, the trappers, and the surveyors for the P·acific railways.
TOPOGRAPHIC OUTLINE
In its larger geographic relations the Kaiparowits region forms part of the Colorado Plateau province,· which comprises 100,000. square miles of strongly carved tabular relief emphasized by volcanic masses. The outstanding topographic features are terraced plateaus, cliff-bound mesas, monoclinal ridges, and straight-sided canyons-all impressive alike for magnitude and ruggedness. Land sculpture is developed on so enor:mous a scale that features in the landscape unnoticed here would be prominent and picturesque landmarks in other surroundings.

The crest of the W aterpocket Fold stands at 6,000 feet, and for a distance of more than 50 miles the ICaiparowits Plateau shows a level top at 7,000 feet and rises to 9,000 feet at Canaan Peak. But so deeply has the region been trenched that two-thirds ~f the Paria River, one-half of the Escalante River, and nearly all of Halls Creek flow in channels below 5,000 feet and Glen Canyon is cut to depths below the 4,000-foot contour line. The extreme points of the ICaiparowits region are Table Cliff, 10,500 feet, and Lees Ferry, 3,120 feet. Immediately bordering the region and forming, as it were, its western and northern wall are the High- Plateaus-the Paunsaugunt (9,500 feet) and the Aquarius (Thousand Lake Mountain) 10,000 to 12,250 feet-the highest land in southern Utah. For the region as a whole changes in altitude are abrupt; gentle slopes are conspicuously absent. Above the valley floors the plateau benches rise Ly steps, bench after bench, and into the benches the streams are sunk an equal amount.
Most of these benchlike platforms tenninate in cliffs hundreds or even thousands of feet in height. On the south face of the Paunsaugunt Plateau the Chocolate Cliffs, Vermilion Cliffs, White Cliffs, and Pink Cliffs, separated by broad platforms,. form a terraced wall more than 5,000 feet high. A series of prominent benches are nearly continuous along the northeast and southwest slopes of the Kaiparowits Plateau, and the southeast end of the plateau forms a giant stairway descending 3,500 feet to the Colorado River, about 5 miles distant. Few benches interrupt the precipitous slope that leads to the top of the Paria Plateau, 3,000 feet above the stream at its base, or the wall that rises more than 4,000 feet in front of the Table · Cliff Plateau.
The plateau benches are so continuous that canyons which cut their edges appear at a distance ~ts insignificant breaks in a horizontal sky line. Some of the benches are so wide and level that canyons sunk into them are inconspicuous features. Even Glen Canyon appears from a distance as a narrow groove in a broad expanse of flat land.
Except for the lava flows that partly cover the limestones of the Paunsaugunt and Aquarius Plateaus, all the topographic features of the ICaiparowits region have been developed in sedin1entary rocks; the volcanic piles, the laccoliths, and the necks of bordering regions are absent. The Kaiparowits Plateau is a ,slightly tilted sedimentary mass that extends as a narrow mesa from the High Plateaus to Glen Canyon, 70 miles distant. Its culminating point, Canaan Peak, is an outlier of the. Table Cliff Plateau ; the Paria

Plateau is a huge block of sandstone, the W aterpocket · monocline is a ridge of folded rock intricately dissected and flanked by hogbacks, and the broken " comb " in the vicinity of Paria is· the edge of sandstone beds upturned in the East Kaibab fold. The Circle Cliffs are inward-facing walls of sandstone that rim an oval depression. These prominent features are but large-scale examples of the mesas, buttes, and ridges that characterize the landscape of southern Utah. The view from any vantage point gives a feel-
ing of strength and solidity. Delicacy and grace o'f
outline are lost in the general1nassiveness. The huge mesas ringed with high escarpments rise from horizontal benches, some of them miles in width, and the buttes are firmly based on broad expanses of rock. Except on the High Plateaus talus slopes are replaced by bare ledges. Even in detail e.rosion fonns follow a common pattern of angles rather than of curves and slopes; pilasters, panels, and alcoves are bounded by straight lines. Canyons are everywhere. Many of them are trenches cut into a seemingly level surface and are seen only wh~n their rims are reached; others are so intricately interlaced as to leave no space for trails. Near Canaan Peak the heads of 14 canyons were crossed in a distance of about 3 miles.
In general the surface slopes of the region extend from the High Plateaus southeastward to the Colorado; "down these slopes the water is carried in bare rock canyons. The Escalante, with its mm~y tributaries, carries the run-off from 1,840 square miles; the Paria drains 935 square miles and receives most of its 'vater from its western tributaries. Halls Creek, 40 miles long, drains about 110 square miles. Rain that ft1lls on the south side of the ICaiparowits Plateau goes directly to Glen Canyon. Few regions are so thoroughly drained. Flat-floored, wide washes are rare, and only on the tops and about the base of the Aquarius and Table Cliff Plateaus are there stretches of meadow, through which the tiny streams make their way. A shallow pond on the J(aiparowits' Plateau is the only permanent body of water in the region east of the High Plateaus.
The streams that· head in the Paunsaugunt,· Table . Cliff, and J(aiparowits Plateaus have permanent water in their upper courses, and a few of the boxlike heads of canyons in the W aterpocket Fold contain running water. The characteristic stream of the region is an intermittent one, whic~1 usually flows in places along its course but which becomes throughgoing. only in response to seasonal rains and local showers. In exceptionally dry years the only water received by the Colorado between the Escalante River and the Paria River is probably contained in the liquid mud supplied by the San Juan. The Paria River and Halls Creek are at times without water in parts of their courses, .and even in the Escalante Canyon

14 THE KAIPAROWITS REGION

stretches of bare sand have been recorded. The influence of the semiarid climate shown by the behavior of streams is reflected likewise in the soil and vegetation. There are no large areas of dunes, but sand is piled here and there in and beyond the stream channels. There are ·no areas of desert in the sense o:f widespread stretches of salt and alkali, but the lower Escalante Valley and parts o:f the Wahweap country are without water and show sparse and specialized vegetation, adjusted to sterile soil and low rainfall. The canyon walls, the faces of mesas and buttes, and expanses o:f rock many square miles in area seem remarkably naked. These wind-swept surfaces-are so bare of vegetation that green tints and subdued tones resulting from plant covering are lacking in the landscape. The conspicuous colors seen'are the c9lors of the rocks themselves-red, brown, yellow, and white, intensified by ·bands of dark .gray.
For variety and interest of topographic :forms no part of the plateau province offers more attractions. Distant and near-by views amply repay the necessary hardships of travel.
CLIMATE OF SOUTHEASTERN UTAH
GENERAL CONDITIONS
Statistics of rain:fall and temperature within the Kaiparowits region are meager and unsatisfactory. Because of their position the three meteorologic stations in this region record data of little more than local value. Escalante is at the immediate base of the High Plateaus; Carn:lonville (including Losee and Tropic) is near the head of a broad, deeply intrenched valley; Paria is in a canyon. All three stations lie approximately in a north-south ·line, and their records tell little of the ·climatic conditions prevailing east or west of that line. However, the records of these three stations, 'when considered in ·connection with .those of other stations in Kane and Garfield Counties and in adjoining counties, give a reasonably satisfactory picture of the climate of southeastern Utah, of which the Kaiparowits region forms a part.
Utah as a whole· is deficient in rainfall. Only 16 out of 169 stations record averages that exceed 20 inches a year, and only 1 that exceeds 30 inches. Less than 10 inches of rain falls at 50 stations. The High Plateaus are relatively well watered and have severe winters; most stations in this district receive more than 10 inches of rain each year and record mean annual temperatures of about 43°. At the eastern foot of the High Plateaus the rainfall is as heavy as the average on top of the plateaus, but the mean annual temperatures are greater. Between the base of the

plateaus and the Utah-Colorado line all stations record less than 10 inches of rain except Blanding and Monticello, ·on the slopes of Abajo Mountain. The mean annual temperature at G-iles is 51.1o and at Rite 59.7°.
Snow may fall on the High Plateaus at any ti:r;ne between Septembe~· 1 and June 1 and rnay lie for· weeks or even months. Only in exceptional years are the roads to Kanab, to Cannonville, to Escalante, and to Boulder passable in winter without clearing the drifts that block the " dugways." In severe winters
a:these settlements have been isolated for weeks at
time. -On the lower lands of the Escalante, Wahweap, and
Warm Creek Valleys snow rarely remains long enough to interfere with grazing, but all parts of southeastern Vtah receive some snow nearly every year. At Alton the mean annual snowfall is 75.6 inches, and even at Giles it is 10.2 inches.
In southeastern Utah clear skies 'prevail. The few· records available indicate that the amount of sunshine is comparable to that in northern Arizona, forwhich the estimate of the United States WeatherBureau is .210· clear days, .85 ,partly cloudy, and 70· cloudy in a year. It is probable that few if any· places. in southeastern Utah have less clear skies than Flagstaff, Ariz., which receives 81 per cent of the posssible sunshine, and for parts of Garfield and Kane Counties the figure is doubtless greater. During May, June, October, and November the skies may be cloudless for 5 to 15 days in succession. In the sun the heat of sumrner is intense; but in the shade of a rock or tree cool-· ness prevails, and this area is unlike humid regions in that the line between scorching heat and delightful temperature is drawn at the edge of the shadow. Fortunately hot air is also dry air, and the humidity of summer ranges from 30 to 50 per cent. The daily range of temperature i~ more than 40° and usually exceeds the difference between the means of the warmest and of the coolest months jn the year; consequently cool or even uncomfortably cold nights follow the· heated days.
In gener·al, it may be said that southern Utah has a· group of local climates of widely dissimilar aspects.. The distribution of the sun's heat and the form and' position of topographic features appear. to outrank: cyclonic storms and· prevailing winds as controlling factors. The great variability in topographic expres-· sion is reflected in equally great differences in climate.. Not only ar·e the climates of high-lying areas con-· trasted with those of lower altitudes, but canyons that adjoin plateaus, two adjoining valleys, the opposite sides o:f plateaus. and mesas, and even opposing canyon walls may have different climates. The summers are

CLIMATE OF SOUTHEASTERN UTAH

15

very hot, the winters are cold; daylight is accompanied by heat, darkness by chilliness. The annual, seasonal, monthly, and daily rainfall is subject to wide variations. During July and August rain may fall in qu~ntities sufficie~t to flood the country; in most other n10nths precipitation is deficient. During the hottest· months moisture-laden clouds cross the sky but pr·oduce no rain, except perhaps a few scattering drops. To theNavajo and Piute mind the "rain hangs downward " and " sends messages to the earth."
PRECIPITATION
RECORDS
Some miscellaneous observations on the rainfall of southeastern Utah are contained in the reports of earlier scientific explorers, and others are recorded in unpublished reports in the archives of the Mormon Churc4. Additional general informatio~ has come from long-time residents of l{ane and Garfield Counties. Fortunately volunteer observers have inade instrumental records at stations within and bordering the Kaiparowits region; without these unselfish services a discussion of the climate would be wholly speculative.
Cannonville, including Tropic (1889-1919; · 192526) and Losee (1893-94), furnishes the longest continuous record of precipitation in the Kaiparowits region. It affords nearly complete records for 35 years (1889-1923). At Alton, including Ranch (19021915), the precipitation has been recorded for 26 consecutive years (1902-1927). At Escalante the rainfali observations cover 27 years (1901-1927) but are neither consecutive nor complete. For Giles consecutive and complete records are available for 12 years (1.895-1906). For Rite the records for 15 consecutive years (1900-1914) include 12 complete records. At l{anab records have been made since 1899, except during 1901 and 1908-1910, but for only 15 years are there complete records, andi only three groups· of 4 years in regular succession. Paria has records for 6 years (1895-1900), including 5 years consecutive and complete. The observations at Widtsoe cover 16 consecutive years, which include 10 years of full record, with two groups of 4 years in regular succession. The records for these eight stations are too fragmentury for general climatic studies; they suffice, however, to indicate the nature of the rainfall. They enable those interested in water development and agriculture to plan intelligently, for they indicate in a general way the total precipitation, its distribution with reference to the growing season for crops, and whether showers of brief duration or long-continued " soaking " rains normally occur.

The driest year on record at Alton is 1923, with a precipitation of only 11.5 inches, or about half the normal, and this year was .preceded and followed by other dry years. At Cannonville, where the mean annual rainfall is 11.~7 inches, 4.51 inches was recorded for 1918 and nearly five times as much (21.78 inches) for 1906. · The cor-

responding extremes for Rite are 3.12 and 12.36 inches; for Kanab, 7.29 and 20.70 inches; for Paria, 4.85 and 14.9 inches; and for Giles, 2.25 and 11.99 inches.

The fragmentary records show that drought was general in southeastern Utah in 1896, 1899,.19021904, and 1916-1918, and 1922-1924 and that abnormal amounts of rain fell during the years 1905-1911, a

SEASONAL DISTRIBUTION
For ·a region whose maximum precipitation is insufficient for agriculture and in places for grazing, without irrigation, great variations in rainfall from year to year are significant.· Of even greater significance is the amount of rainfall received in corresponding months from year to year. In this respect southeastern Utah is seriously handicapped. (See fig. 4.)
At Escalante the precipitation for January ranges from 0 to 2.45 inches; for July from 0 to 3.40 inches;

CLIMATE OF SOUTHEASTERN UTAH

19

and even for August, the wettest month of the year, from 0.43 to 4.50 inches. At Giles the difference for the· n1onths of different years is as follows : January, trace to 1.10 inches; February, 0 to 1.28 inches; March, trace to 1.10 inches; April, trace to 1.57 inches; May, trace to 1.12 inches; June, 0 to 0.72 inch; July, trace to 1.50 inches; August, 0.17 to 1.56 inches; September, trace to 2 inches; October, 0 to 3.20 inches; November, 0 to 1.20 inches; December, 0 to 0.50 inch. For. some months the rainfall of the driest year exceeds that of the wettest year. Similar contrasts occur in the records of other stations.
The diagrams of seasonal distribution of rainfall (fig. 4) show that summer is the rainy season for Cannonville, Escalante, Paria, and Widtsoe, winter at Alton, winter and spring at Kanab, and fall at Giles and Hite. The records for Cannonville, Escalante, Giles, Hite, and Widtsoe indicate one dry season followed by one wet season with two seasons of intermediate grade. Alton and l{anab have a dry season, preceded and followed by wet seasons. Paria has , three dry seasons. These periods, however, do not correspond with the seasons, as that term is conventionally used. The period July, August, and September is the season for maximum precipitation at Cannonville, Escahtnte, Giles, Paria, and Widtsoe, during which 36 per cent of the total rain falls; and April, May, and June constitute the driest group, with 20 per cent of the precl.pitation. Rainfall in January to March is slightly greater than in October to December; these seasons receive, respectively, about 23 and 21 per cent of the annual precipitation. For Alton :and Kanab, January to March constitute the rainy :season; for Hite, October to December.
The season of least rainfall, April to June, is the ;growing season for most crops, and therefore the sea:sonal distribution of rain is unfavorable for agriculture or vigorous reproduction of many grasses. Half :an inch of rain a month for the period April to June is an unusually large precipitation for most parts of ·southeastern Utah, and during dry years the com·bined precipitation of these three months may be less than half an inch. Moreover, plants obtain only a portion of this meager supply, for evaporation is most ·effective during the clear, dry, hot days of early summer, and the efficiency of the rainfall is correspondingly lessened. The moisture in the ground, which is :supplied by the rains of winter supplemented by the ·scattered showers of spring, is sufficient to allow seeds to germinate ·and to. send .their shoots. above ground but is insufficient to bring a crop to maturity. The rainfall of July therefore becomes the critical climatic factor in grazing and agriculture. The tables show that for the period under observation less than 1 inch ~ ()t rain :falls during July in 10 years out of 26 at .

The influence of altitude and topographic position on temperature is shown by a comparison of the tables for Alton, Giles, Hite, and Kanab. Decreasing altitudes are accompanied by increasing mean annual temperatures. At Alton (altitude 7,000 feet) the thermometer rarely goes above 90°, and the highest temperatures recorded for 18 years are June, 94°; July, 93°; August, 93°; and for four or five months in a year the thermometer falls below 20°, and - 20° has been recorded. At Hite (altitude 3,500 feet) zero t~mperatures are rarely recorded. The range between the highest and the lowe_st monthly means is least for Widtsoe, 5.6°, followed in order by Hite, 28.4°; Alton, 30.9°; Escalante, 31°; Cannonville, 32.4°; Kanab, 33.8° ; and Giles, 34.2°. These figures of mean an. nual temperature and the range between the lowest and the highest average monthly means are not unlike those preva,iling in temperate latitudes and therefore give little indication of.the temperatures experienced in this region.
The annual and daily ranges of temperature are of greater significance. The maximum annual range recorded for 'Alton is 114° (94° to -20°) ; for Escalr.nte, .115° (98° to -17°) ; for Giles, 132° (111o to -21°) ; for Hite, 1166 (115° to -1°) ; for Kanab, 120° (105° to -15°); and· for Widtsoe, 109° (92° to -17°). The greatest range (133°) is at Cannonville, where a July and August temperature of 101o is offset by the )ow February record of 32° below zero. At all points within the Kaiparowits region below 7,000 feet, temperatures that exceed 100° normally occur for tO to 20 days each year. At such times the temperature in the sun is almost intolerable. In the Fiftymile Desert and the W ah~eap country the surface soil reaches 140°, and bridle buckles and camp utensils exposed to the sun almost scorch the fingers. Except within the deeper major valleys and to a less extent in other canyons, temperatures below zero are normal in December, January, and February, and at points on the higher plateaus zero weather for five or six days in succession has been experienced. Reservoirs are coated with ice, and the soil is frozen to depths of 2 to 6 feet. Nearly every year the Colorado River in Glen Canyon freezes over in places; in 1878 the ice was 2 feet thick at Lees Ferry; and during the winter of 1924-25 horses were taken across on the ice at the mouth of Halls Creek-a feat many

times performed by the Navajos at the Crossing of the Fathers.
High ranges in annual temperature are accompanied by great daily range. A daily range of about 40° is probably common to the whole area; ranges of 50° have frequently been experienced. A worker in this region soon learns that however hot the day may be an ample supply of blankets may be required at night. In June, 1918, along. the south rim of the Kaiparowits Plateau the heat of the day interfered with field work, but on three mornings frost covered the ground. At altitudes above 5,000 feet several days with temperatures of· 70° to 80° were followed by nights in which ice formed in the camp buckets. Sudden changes during the· day are infrequent, except when thundershowers cool the air for a few hours. On hot summer days a hailstorm may lower the temperature within an hour to a point where handling instruments and writing in notebooks is painful.
Fortunately, however, in the Kaiparowits region high temperatures and great daily range are accompanied by dry air. Instrumental measurements have not been made, but for the region as a whole the humidity is probably less than at Flagstaff, .1\riz., where the mean. relative humidity is 62 per cent, being lowest (39 per cent) during June, the driest and, during some years, the hottest moilth.29 High humidity and high temperature are not contempora_neous, with the result that heat, though distressing, is not enervating and oppressive. Here, as in the Navajo country, "a hot-air bath, not a steam bath, is part of the daily routine."
The average date of the first killing frost of tutumn ranges from September 12 at Alton and Cannonville to November 3 at Hite; and the average date of the last killing frost of spring ranges from March 24 at Hite to June 20 at Alton. The stations under observation (seep. 21) have normally a growing season as follows: Alton, 84 days; Cannonville, 98 days; Widtsoe, 99 days ; Kanab, 128 days; Escalante, 128 days; Giles, 140 days; and Hite, 224 days. No frost records are available for Paria. Where water has been made available this long growing season, coupled with l).igh temperature, is favorable for alfalfa, corn,

and fruit raising. Ho,vever, when a period of several years is considered, it appears that the normal length. of the growing season may be much shortened. Thus the growing season may be shortened by six weeks at Rite and reduced to 95 days at Giles, 50 days at Kanab, 75 days at Widtsoe, 51 days at Escalante, and 22 days at Cannonville; and Alton may ha.ve killing frost any month of the year. These records are charted in Figure 5.
The bearing of these figures on agriculture may be seen from the fact that corn requires, on the average, 90 to 150 days and fruit an even longer time to reach maturity.

up and down canyon walls the air seems continuously in motion and at times is difficult to face, but during the course of field work no widely sweeping sandstorm was encountered. The most disagree~ble experiences are associated with the huge clouds of whirling dust which roll across the ground to meet the oncoming thundershowers. As compared with the winds in adjacent areas, those of the Kaiparowits region are neither intense nor continuous. In the minds of the Navajo who live south of the Colorado River the Wind People were sent to dry up the earth, and "Wind and Night" (sandstorm) is a dreaded expression of powers :for evil.

24 THE KAIPAROWITS REGION

SOIL

In the Kaiparowits region soil is rare; if defined

:as deeply decomposed or disintegrated rock mixed

with humus and water it is almost absent. On flat-

.topl)ed mesas and plateaus the soil, weathered directly

from the 'underlying rock, forms a mantle a few inches

thick, but even here the soil cover is not continuous.

On the plateau edges (the " breaks ") the areas of dis-

integrated shale and sandstone, though technically

dassed as soil, have no agricultural value. In general

the conditions are unfavorable for makino- and retain-
.b
1ng soils. The scanty vegetation, the absence of sod,

the sudden showers, and the rapid run-off favor re-

moval·of the soil as rapidly as it is formed. Soil does

not remain on the steep slopes that are characteristic

of this region, nor on flatter areas where the surface is

thoroughly washed by tumultuous waters from cloud-

bursts and swept clean by winds. Over: hundreds of

square miles the surface consists of clean, bare rock.

Most of the soil in this region is transported soil. It

has been brought to its present position by streams and

wind. ·Many depressions on the surface have been

filled by debris washed from their .edges, and into

many rock cracks surface materiaL from near-by

places has been dumped. Some former canyons and

innumerable tributary valleys have been partly filled

with stream-borne debris, and a few flat-floored valleys are flanl~ed with soil deposited at highwater

.stages. Similar soil is displayed in alluvial cones

:along valley sides and in fragmentary terraces that

cling to canyon walls. Eolian soils in the form of

dunes are displayed· here and there at the bases of

cliffs, on open flats, and within canyons. At one place

in the Escalante Valley dunes have completely oblit-

et·ated the canyon wall and replaced bare rock with

soil that supports a cover of vegetation. In the Wah-

weap country wind-blown soil coats large areas, and

fine dust settling from the air probably forms part of.

1nost soils in this region. In fact, some of the best

grazing areas in valleys owe their value to annual

grasses that find uncertain foothold in the shiftino0-

sands.

.

·

Such soil as the region affords is derived from rocks

that are deficient in the mineral matter needed by

plant~. The sand~tone and sandy shale of the Paria

Valley, Glen Canyon, Waterpock:et Fold, and Esca-

tnnte Valleys are prevailingly quartzose and therefore

.poorly supplied with plant foods. The sandsto~e and

sha.lethat constitute the upper half of the Kaiparowits

Plateau co~tain a higher proportion of desirable min-

erals, and the limestone and basaltic lava alono- the
. .b
race and top of the Paunsaugunt, Table Cliff, and

·Aquarius Plateaus furnish soil of good quality. But,

although about 90 per cent of the soil is derived from

rocks that furnish little or no lime, potash, and phos-

phoric and sulphuric acid, the soil is not infertile, owing

largely .to the arid climate. Because the scant supply of water in the ground is not sufficient to leach out the soluble constituents, the bits of plant food sparingly distributed in the rocks are accumulated in the soils · and stored for long periods. That the soil has fertility is shown by the vigorous natural growth of perennials and annuals where sufficient water is present and by the c~ops harvested at Lees Ferry, Paria, Cannonville, and Escalante. The one substance lackinbo- is water. The dry air and open-textured soil permits the moisture to escape at the surface, thus depressing the water table to a depth that makes natural farming unprofitable and dry farming speculative, but irrigation farming brings satisfactory returns. Unfortunately there is not enough water available in the Kaiparowits region to supply more than a few square miles, except at prohibitive cost. The most favorably situated lands are already under irrigation, ·and the land that might be irrigated is more than offset by the amount destroyed by the down cutting of alluvium in the washes. (See p. 30.)

VEGETATION
Members of the Powell and Wheeler surveys were impressed by the general scantiness of the plant cover of southern Utah. Powell 31 remarks:
Many portions of the elevated district are devoid of tim-
ber ; * * * the forests of these upper. regions ar~ monotonous, as the variety of tree life is very small ; * * * the coniferous trees * * * are ragged and gnarled, and
the lumber they afford is not of the finest quality.
Powell lists 5 species of pines, 6 of fir, 2 of juniper, 3 of poplar, a maple, a box ·elder'; an oa~, a birch, a hackberry, and 2 species of ash-these last seven rareas
a nearly complete list of forest trees. * * . * Nearly all the
grasses on the highlands are bunch grass. The spaces by which they are separated at;e bare or occupied by weeds and
shrubs. * * ·• A continuous turf is never seen. * * *
The regions south a~~:d east of the High Plateaus are exceedingly desolate ; naked rocks are found, refusing footing even for dwarfed cedars and piiion pines ; the springs are infrequent and yield n·o bountiful supply; its patches of grass are widely scattered, and it has but little value for agricultural purposes.
Dutton 32 ·saw in sharp contrast the veo-etation of the rim of the Aquarius Plateau and of th; canyon lands that stretch eastward to the Colorado. He says :
Yesterday [in upper Fremont Valley] we were toiling over a burning soil, where nothing grows save the ashy-colored sage, the prickly pear, and a few cedars that writhe and contort their stunted limbs under a scorching sun. To-day we are among forests of rare beauty and luxuriance ; the air is moist

If Dutto~1 had descended fr01n the High Plateaus

to the "desolate" Escalante Basin, where "the air

boils like a pot," or had visited the Paria and Glen

Canyon districts, s01ne harsh lines would be absent

from his picture. Traverses of these regions bring to

view a remarkably distributed and widely varied flora,

above which, along the. plateau rims and tops, trees

and brush are as abundant as in most parts of the

Colorado plateaus. It is true, however, that vegeta-

tion in the I\:aiparowits region has an unfriendly en-

vironment. Nowhere is it luxuriant, and at few places

do the plants crowd one another in their search for

water and favorable soil. As a rule, the grass is in

hunches, the shrubs in clumps, and the trees in small groves with considerable spac~s separ'ating them.

Many plnnts hnve no nenr neighbors; they stnnd as

individuals in tracts of several acres or are present by

twos or threes in areas of several square miles. Ex-

cept on the I\:aiparowits Plateau and about the head-

waters of the Paria and Escnlnnte Rivers, patches of

gL'een are a small part of the landscape. Large areas

ure devoid of vegetation.

The high walls of hundreds of canyons are in gen-

eral without plant cover on their faces and on their

tops. It is possible to follow the rim of Glen Canyon

from the Paria to Halls Creek and to continue the

journey along· the crest of the vVaterpocket Fold to

the Circle Cliffs without stepping on grass or passing

beneath trees. (See pl. 21, 0.) Similar conditions

would be found in a traverse along the Escalante

River from its mouth to Sand Creek. For the region

a~ a whole, including the plateau tops, cliffs, and can-

yon walls, it is estimated that vegetation. in the sense

that that ter1n is used in the Colorado plateau prov-

ince covers 20 per cent of the surface; for the lower

Escalante Valley, the southeast end of the l(aiparo-

wits Plateau, and the south half of the W aterpocket

Fold it covers probably less than 5 per cent.

The distribution of plant life in the Kaiparowits

region corresponds roughly with the zonal. arrange-

ment outlined for northeastern Arizona,33 but the

boundaries of the zones are more irreo-ular and broader

ecologic provinces. The unusually con1plex vertical and horizontal arrangement of canyons, stream flats, slopes, cliffs, mesa tops, plateau tops, areas of soil, and areas of bare rock naturally provides local environment with little regard to contour lines.
Cottonwoods grow within the lowest canyons at 3,125 feet and also .in dry washes above 6,000 feet. In places yellow pine constitutes forests between 7,000 and 9,000 feet but is absent from large areas between 7,000 and 8,000 feet and appears here and there below u,OOO feet. Pifi.on and juniper range from about 3,500 feet to the edge of the High Plateaus at 10,000 feet. Sagebrush, willow, and water-loving grasses, reeds; and ferns seem to be distributed almost regardless of altitude.
Although it is difficult to establish boundaries, it has been found convenient in field work to recognize three plant zones in the Kaiparowits region, as follows:
1. Zone of cottonwood, cactus, and yucca. This zone includes the Coloradq and tributary valleys to an altitude of about 5,000 feet. Within this zone vegetation is everywhere scanty. In Glen Canyon yucca and cactus occupy the few talus slopes and cling to the walls; willow grows profusely on exposed sand bars, reappearing after each flood; cottonwoods stand on high level terraces at the mouths of tributary streams, where scrub cedar, oak, box elder, Brigham tea, rabbit brush, hackberry, and greasewood are also found. The vines and bushes within and adjoining Glen Canyon are duplicated in the Paria, Escalante, and Halls Valleys and along streamways draining south from the l{aiparowits Plateau. Cottonwoods are particularly abundant in the Paria Valley. The vines present include poison oak, Virginia creeper, clematis, and grape. Grass of several varieties appears as detached tufts among boulders, in rock cracks, and on quiescent sand dunes. Moss and ferns watered from seeps form .green· spots on red sa.nclstone walls. Tamarisks and Lomhardy poplar that were planted at Paria about 1875 have made good growths; fruit trees, corn, and sorghum give satisfactory yields at Paria, Halls Ranch, Lees Ferry, and Hite.
2. Zone of pinon, juniper, and sage; altitude, 5,000 to 8,000 feet. The dominant vegetation for a larger part of the Kaiparowits region consists of continuous forests, scattered patches, and individual trees of pinon and juniper, together with vigorously growing sagebrush. (See pls. 8, B ; 22, B.) This type prevails on the top and flanks of the Kaiparowits Plateau, along both sides of the W aterpocket Fold, and on the slopes of the Paunsaugunt, Table Cliff, and Aquarius Plateaus. The relative amounts of pinon and juniper differ widely from place to place, and the sage grows under the trees, in " parks " between them, or in uninterrupted fields covering hundreds of acres.

With regard to the utilization of the Ian~ the vege.:. tation of Garfield, Kane, and San Juan Counties, Utah, has been studied by Depue Falck,34 of the United States Geological Surv.ey. He recognizes. five · zones, which he describes as follows:
1. The transition desert brush type occupies the lower altitudes of the region and is a mixture of various small brush species which differ in dominance and density according to local conditions. The more common of these plants are species of saltbush, such as shadscale (A.triplem confe1"tifol'ia), com-

and round about Canaan Peak yellow pine predomi- mon saltbush (A.tri;plem canescens), two small suffrutescent .

nates at altitudes under 9,000 feet and is followed upward in turn by spruce and fir. The trees are interspersed with beautiful groves of aspen and undergrown with oak, willo1v, manzanita, sage, and many

species (A.triplex mtttallil :mel A.triplem oo·rrugata), as well as little rabbit brush, black brt1sh (Ooleogyne rO!Inosi.ssima), Mormon or Brigham tea (Ephedra), greasewood (Sarcobatu.s VCIWI:icula·tttS), yucca, and pricklypear. Grama, galleta, and Indian rice are the principal grasses.

grasses. In places the pines grow singly or in widely 2. The shadscale type occupies only a few of the lower

spaced groups, and grass-floored parks are common. Nearly all the lands ,in zone 3 are within the Powell National Forest-the source of lumber and of summer grazing 'for Kane, Garfield, Wayne, and Piute Counties. The following list of plants growing in

valleys, where shadscale (A.triplem confertifoUa) is the dominant shrub and is usually associated with little rabbit brush, saltbush, and either grama or galleta grass.
3. The juniper-pinon type is found throughout the area under discussion between altitudes of 5,000 and 7,000 feet. Within this type as mapped are many small open patches where pure

4. The oak type occurs in only a few relatively small areas at the higher altitudes, generally adjoining the timbered ·forest areas. .This type as mapped west of Monticello represents an almost. pure stand of oak brush (QttorettS 1l-ta.l1r ensis) supplemented by a few scattering yellow pine and in places small sage patches. OI;J. the slopes of the Henry Mountains the type includes a number of other species and is . in reality a high brush type, with oak the dominant species. · The ridge of this range is extremely rocky and barren, supporting only a sparse growth of purple loco weed, whereas the upper portion of the north slopes contains patches of spruce, fir, and aspen, and yellow pine grows lower down and in the canyons. Some of this timber would have commercial value if it were accessible. Sagebrush, buck brush ( SymphoricarzJos), and cliff rose ( Oowania st011tsbwriana) are associated ,vith the oak brush on thes.e mountains. At Alton a scattered yellow. pine is associated with the oak brush.
5. The sage type designates areas where sage (A.rternisi.a. tridentata) presents a dominant appearance to the eye and makes up practically 75 per cent of the ground cover. Bunch gr[lSS (Agropyron spicatum) is the principal secondary species at the higher altitudes but is replaced by galleta grass (Hua.ri(J. jan~psU) on the lower mesas. Scattering plants of big rabbit

tended their settlements west, east, and south but crossed the Colorado only· for hunting and barter. Likewise the Piutes, who appear to have been forced by hostile tribes to occupy undesirable lands, chose the San Juan a.nd Virgin Valleys and the plateau lands farther west and east in preference to the Paria· and. Escalante .Valleys and the l{aiparowits Plateau. Arrowhea.ds found here and there show that the reo-ion belo:w the rim of t}:le High Plateaus was a huntingground, but the springs and canyon bottoms show no· sjgns of long-time occupancy. Thompson in 1872 met one band of Piutes at the northeast base of the Aquarius Plateau, and the pioneer Mormon band found four or five Piute families living in the Potato Valley. Several times the Navajos entered the Paria Valley by the Crossing of the Fathers and raided the pio~eer outposts, and they still visit the Kaiparowit~ regiOn to sell blanket~ and buy buckskin. The Piutes l!~_ewise come occasionally to sell baskets and to gather pinon nuts and medicinal herbs. The 1920 census lists· four Indians in Garfield County and none in J{ane County. During the course of geologic field wo:dr in. l.0.. 1915, 1918, .1921, 1922, and 1924 the only human beings seen ~uts1de of settlements were a family in camp at Pn.na, cattlemen engaged in a round-up on Halls Creek, and a few sheep herders within the national forest and on the J{aiparowits Plateau.

gin, Santa Clara, Ashe, and Muddy Valleys were occupied, and the way was opened for extending settlements eastward along the base of the High Plateaus to the Paria River and to regions south of the Colorado.
For this work of colonization the adherents of the Mormon Church were peculiarly adapted. Unlike the Spanish explorers, intent on conquest and conver:sion, the scouts of the church were men interested primarily in agriculture and stock raising. It was their business to find lands, water, and grass-to select spots suitable for villages and farms.· The pioneer colonists were looking for homes, not ~or places to exploit and abandon. Out of this attitude grew their policy of dealing with the Indians-a watchful friendliness, which has saved southern Utah from the disastrous experiences of most other parts of the country. To the Mormons the Piutes, Navajos, and ·Hopi are Lamanites, one of the lost tribes of Israel, who may gt·adually be reclaimed,. and they are also neighbors, with whom friendly relations are essential.
Regarding the Piutes of southern Utah, Brigham· Young wrote to Jacob Hamblin 86 on March 5, 1858 :
The hour of their redemption draws nigh, and the time is not far distant when they will receive knowledge and· begin to rise and increase in the land and become a people whom the Lord will bless.
The Indians should be encouraged in keeping and taking care of stock. I highly approve of your designs in doing' your farming through the natives ; it teaches them to obtain a subsistence by their own industry and leaves you more liberty to visit others and extend your missionary labors among them. A few missionaries to show and instruct them how to raise stock and grains, and then not eat it up for them, is most judicious. You should always be careful to impress upon them that they should not infringe upon their rights in any particular, thus cultivating honor and good principles in their midst by example as well as precept.
In a public address .in October, ·1852, Brigham
Young said:
Any man who cheats an Indian should be dealt with ·more severely than for cheating a white man. You brethren must lay aside your angry feelings toward them and ceas~ wish.ing to kill them.
From the day of its founding St. <;ieorge became the commercial, administrative, and ecclesiastic capital of southern Utah. With frienq.s and ·supplies assured, outlying settle1nents could be established with some confidmice. Pipe Springs was coloniz,ed in 18~3; Moccasin Springs, Kanab, and Mount Carmel i~ 1864, and Paria in 1865. I\::ane County, with 16 settlements, was organized in 1865. This hopeful progress came to an end with the beginning of the ~avajo raids in 1866, and for the next five years the population of the whole county probably averaged less than 25 whites. For the two years precedi.ng the first attacks the Indians had been restless. The_ coming of a few

peaceful whites to live among i.hem was not disagreeable, but the uninvited occupation of lands by an increasing number of families, with flocks and herds, was alarming. In the minds· of the Indian all land and f01·ago and hunting in southern Utah belonged to the Piutes or to the Navajos, and all food supplies were the 'common property of the clans. To him possession of land did not in1ply continuous occupancy. It was not only his privilege to ask for food; it was his right to demand it. Even before the coming of the Mormon pioneers and the possession of firearms and horses, the profitable trade in furs and skins had made it less necessary to depend for support on the cultivation of small tracts of land, supplemented by hunting, and the possession of horses and firearms made the Indian still more a nomad. A particular grievance of the Piutes was the destruction by sheep and cattle of the " ak " and other grasses, the seeds of which were a valuable source of food. As Jacob H.amblin 37 expresses it:
The great numbers of animals brought into the country by the settlers soon devoured most of the vegetation that had produced nutritious seeds, on which· the Indians had been accustomed to sub.::ist. When, at the proper season of the year, the natives resorted to these places to gather seeds, they found they had been destroyed by cattle. ·with, perhaps, their ·children crying for food, only the poor consolation was left them of gathering around their camp fires and talking over their grievances.
Those who have caused these troubles have not realized the situation. I have many times been sorely grieved to sea the Indians with their little ones glaring upon a table spread with fQod and trying to get our people to un(Jerstand their circumstances, without being able to do so. Lank hunger and other 'influences have caused them to commit many depredations.
Piute and Navajo alike resented the ·facts that deer and elk and mountain sheep were driven from their accustomed feeding grounds and that the domestic livestock which took their place were treated a~ private property.
The troubles began by a Navajo raid on Paria, the most distant outpost,. and · the theft of cattle from l(anab;. and this raid was followed by Piute attacks on emigrant trains that were going from Salt Lake to California and by the murder of settlers at Short Creek, Pipe Springs, Upper Valley, and Averett Creek. · In 1869 three nieinbers of Powell's exploring party were killed while asleep. That these murders of Indians by whites and whites by Indians did not develop into a disastrous war with its consequent devastation of a:.U white settlements in southern Utah is largely·. owing to the faith, skill, and daring of Jacob Hamblin, 'Yho discouraged repdsals and took upon him~elf the task of visiting hostile bands with a view to establish-. ing peaceful relations. Late in 1865 he attempted to visit the Navajo chiefs, going by the Lees Ferry-l':lba

route, but upon reaching o'raibi he learned that the Navajos were in a revengeful mood and that" it would be useless and perhaps dangerous to go into their country." Returning to St. G.eorge, he began a series of visits to the cl::ms north of the Colorado River~ with the hope that the Piutes would throw in their lot with the l\1ormon pioneers. The prospects were not bright, for the white man's way of doing things did not appeal to the redskins. Hamblin was told in 1856:
'Ve cnn not be good; we must be Pintes.. We want- you to he kind to us. It mny be thnt some of our children will be good, but we wnnt to follow our old customS.88
But tact, combined with the previous fair treatment fl.nd the hereditary feud between Piutes and Navajos, finally led to an alliance, and during the years 1867 to 1871 Piutes and Mormons sympathetically combined in watching· passes and water holes on the ArizonaUtah trails and in warding off attacks of marauding Navajo bands.
The misunderstanding between the Piutes and whites came to an end with that remarkable conference o:f September 19, 1870, on the bleak summit of Shivwits Plateau, when in replying to Hamblin and Major Powell the chief of the Shivwits said: so
Your talk is good, and we believe what you sny. 'Ve believe in Jncob and look upon you as a father. 'Vhen you are hungry, ~·ou may have our gmne. You may gather our sweet fruits. 'Ve will give you food when you come to our land. ·we will show you the springs, and you may drink; the water is good. We will be friends, and when· ~-ou come we will be glad. We will tell the Indians who live on the other side of the great river that we have seen Ka-pu-rats (one arm off, referring to Major Powell), and he is the Indians' friend. 'Ve will tell them· he is Jarob's friend. We are very poor. Look at our women and children; they are nakec~. We have no horses; we climb the rocks, and our feet are sore. We live amollg rocks, and they yield little food nnd many thorns. When the cold moons come our children are hungry. 'Ve have not much to give; you must not think ns menn.

mnny things. You nre very wise; you have a good heart. ·we will be friends. Nothing more haYe I to say..
In 1871 peace was concluded with the Navajos, and the long succession of thefts, parleys, murders, and punishments came to an end. In the fall of that year Hamblin and Powell proceeded to Fort Defiance, using the newly found crossing at Lees Ferry, and in a council attended by some 6,000 Navajos considered for three days the hoped-for peaceful relations to be establishecl among the Navajos, Piutes, and whites. The council was continued at Oraibi, where an agreement was reached that in the settlement of future misunderstandings Hastele should represent the Navajos and Hamblin the ~1ormons of southern Utah. The peace
,; ' Ttalk closed with the words of the Navajo spokesman: e hope we may be able to eat at one table, wann by one fire, smoke one pipe, and sleep under one blanket." This unwritten arbitration treaty was faithfully kept; even the treacherous killing of three Navajos in 1875 by a resident of Grass Valley, which roused the revengeful feelings of the whole Navajo tribe, did not result in further bloodshed.
Confidence in the word of the Navajos led the pioneers to reoccupy their abandoned fields and villages and to search for new locations in the region east of the High Plateaus: The ruined homes at Paria (winter, 1871) and at Lees Ferry (1873) were restored. Cannonville (1875), Henrieville (1878), and Escalante (1875) were colonized, and permanent settlers came to the Fremont Valley (1883). ·
But the reclamation of lands and the building of homes in the J{aiparowits region presented difficulties not experienced by the settle1nents farther west. The climate is unfavorable, and the approach to cities that serve as sources of supply is long and difficult. In corresponding latitudes the oases at the west base of the 'Vasatch are warmer, receive 30 per cent 1nore rainfall, and are traversed by strea1ns of greater and more regular flow. Escalante is 80 miles ·from the railroad; Cannonville 90 miles; and Paria, by way of J(anab, more than 150 n1iles. Escalante, Henrieville, and Paria are at the very ends of little-traveled roads; very few people pass through then1 except to visit the score of families on upper Boulder Creek.
From the borders of these settlements unoccupied land extends for 120 miles; eastern Kane and Garfield Counties and two-thirds of San Juan County constitute an area of about 10,600 square miles within which there are no permanent habitations. The ranch lmildings at Rite, at Halls Creek, and in the Henry l\1ountain~ are intermittently occupied, and prospectors con1e and go from their cabins in upper Glen Canyon, but neither white men nor Indians have chosen this region for more than temporary use: Furtherm01:e, the settlements themselves are separated f~om one another by natural ba.rriers.

Likewise. the exploitation by the American Placer Corporation of the assumed gold resources of the region, which in 1910 resulted in recording 108 mining claims, affords no promise of a repopulated district. (Seep. 148.)
CANNONViLLE, HENRIEVILLE, AND TROPIC
\Vith Cannonville as a center, fiye settlements have been established in the upper Paria Valley-all of them within a radius ot about 6 miles. Three of these-Cannonville, IIenriev~lle, and Tropic-have grown into villages; the other two-Clifton, 2 miles c..·ast of Tropic, and Georgetown, 3 1niles southwest of Cnnnonville, on Yellow Creek-were abandoned because of the scarcity of water and the destruction of the fields by floods. The site of these villages has advantages not found elsewhere in the Paria Valley. It is well watered and has good soil; firewood, coal, and lumber are near at hand; extensive tracts for grazing surround it; and the climate is suitable for field crops and during most years for fruits. That the settlmnent of this region was delayed 10 years after the establishment of l(ahab and Paria is due largely to its isolation. To reach it from the west in,·olved building expensi,ve roads down the cliffs of the I-Iigh Plateaus, and from the south the only feasible approach is along the bed of the Paria River. The first settlers came to Cn.nnonville in 1875, to Clifton in 1876, to I-Ienrieville in 1878, to Georgetown in 1886, and to Tropic ·in 1891. \Vith some fluctuations, the combined population of the three existing villages has shown a small, consistent increase. All the settlements in the upper Paria Valley have experienced great difliculty in controlling the intakes of irrigation ditches a.nd in maintaining the canals across the alluvial flats. Beginning about 1890, the Pari~ River and many tributary stremns have cut deeply into their floors, replacing fertile fields with a network of canyons walled with sand and gravel. At Henrieville and Cannonville about a third of the arable acreage of 1880 has been destroyed, and each year sees .more fertile soil carried away as stream-lorne silt. At Georgetown land sufficient for the support of one family remains. · Tropic has, forestalled future difficulties by developing an irrigation supply high on the Paunsaugunt Plateau, where a dam on the Sevier Uivet· nnd a ditch 4 miles long directs water over the plateau rim to lands along the Paria. Since this ditch

was completed in 1894 the village has more than doubled its population.
ESCALANTE
In 1871 the Escalante Valley was visited by Hamblin. In 1872 Delle~baugh and Thompson, of Powell's exploring expedition," saw Mormons from Panguitch who talked of making a settlement here and advised them to caU the place Escalante." (See p. 8.) The first settlers came in 1875, and a town site was selected in 1876 in the Potato Valley, near the junction of Pine Creek and the Escalante River-the present village. of Escalante. The reports of arable land, of abundant water for ir;rigation and power, and of favorable grazing lands that extended far in all directions induced many families to leave the less congenial plateau tops tu the \vest, even though for the first two years some of them were forced to find shelter under overhanging rocks, in caves dug in banks, and in makeshift wickiups, tents, and shacks. Five years after its establishment the Escalante ward enrolled 441 names, and its consistent growth has nl.ade the village the largest compact settlement in southeastern Utah. As a typical record of pioneering in the l(aiparowits region the following account of the settlement of Escalante is given by permission of the historian of· the Church of Latter-day Saints:
In February, 1875, William J. Flake, Isaac Riddle, Isaac J. Riddle, Charles D. White, Isaac Turley, and William Hutchings, all of Beaver, Utah, crossed the Escalante Mountains from Sweetwater and explored the region of country lying along the Escalat;J.te Creek and its tributaries with a view to finding a place suitable for the location of a settlement. These brethren, being favorably impressed with the country, measured some of the land where Escalante now stands and estimated that there were 1,000 acres of arable land or more which could be used for agricultural pm·poses. They also found a great plaster of Paris bed on the hills on the southwest. These brethren gave a good report of the country, which led to the settlement of Escalante being founded the same year.
A number of brethren from Panguitch, who desired to change their place of residence to a country where the climnte· was more mode1·ate than on the upper Sevier, decided to settle in Potato Valley or on the Escalante Creek, having been impressed by the report of the explorers already mentioned. Consequently Andrew Peter S:.:how (w·ho was appointed by Bishop George W. Sevy, of Panguitch, to take charge of the proposed colony), 'l;'homas Heaps, David Stevenson, Don Carlos Shirts, 'William Alvey (all of Pa11guitch), and Isaac Turnbow, of Panacea·, Nev., crossed the rim of the basin at what is called the Saddle of the E:'3cnlante Mountains June 28, 1875, ·with two wagons. These were the first wagons ever brought into Potato Valley. The brethren succeeded in descending the mountain on the east side after roughlocking the· wheels and a man riding with each hind wheel. Thus they made the dangerous descent and arrived on the present site of Escalante June 29, 1875. The six men mentioned had no families with them. They held a council at the mouth of the canyon and decided to locate a town site on the north sicle of the creek, opposite the place where the town of

32 THE KAIPAROWITS REGION

Escalante now stands. They made. a temporary sur,vey and prepared to build a house, each man claiming a quarter section, in order to. secure the land for other settlers, with a view to building up a town. On this visit these pioneer brethren, while living in their wagons, spent considerable time working on the road over the mountain, most of them returning home for Christmas. The settlers· mentioned represented other men, who also came over during the seasQn and assisted in the work on the road. The understanding was that each man ~hould have 20 acres of farming land, 2% acres of lucern land, and a city lot. In case a man had two wives or more than one family he was to have two or more city lots. Only for a short time during the winter of 1875-76 was the infant settlement entirely vacated.
In February, 1876, some of the brethren who had visited Escalante and worked on the road the previolis year returned to their chosen location and com1_11enced work ·on an irrigation ditch on the north side of the Escalante Creek, in order to bring water onto the town site, but in April, 1876, the brethren agreed to move the town site and build their houses on the south side of the stream for farming purposes. Josiah Barker was the first man who brought in his family; he nrrived in March, 1876, and bad a terrible experience in crossing the East Fork Valley in the snow. About a dozen other families arrived later in the spring. William Alvey, the first to locate his family on the present town site, found shelter in a cellar which he built. In that same cellar all the first women of the settlement found temporary shelter against storms, which were not, infrequent in the beginning. ··The shelter there. was found to be better than in the shanties which the brethren hastily had constructed of willows. In that same cellar, 10 by 12 feet, the first choir practices in the settlement were held, while meetings were .commenced in a bower built of brush and willows in June, 1876. On the 23d of july, 1876, a lumber shanty was hastily built in which a public dinner was served on pioneer day, July 24. All the people participated in this feast, including a number of Piute Indians, altogether 140 souls, not counting canines. Previous to this, on the centennial day of the United States, July 4, 1876, the people showed their loyalty as best they could. · In
athe absence of a better flng they hoisted striped Navajo
blanket to the breeze. They, however, sent for a genuine

flag, which was raised on the 24th. At this time there was only a very little water in the Escalante Creek-scarcely sufficient for the people to irrigate their garden spots, to say nothing of their farms-but in a most marvelous way the water commenced to increase, though there was considerable scarcity of water until 1882.
The unsatisfactory feature of Escalante's situa6on is its inaccessibility. The village stands at the base of slopes and cliffs that necessitate a climb of 2,700 feet to reach the" saddle" between the Aquarius and Table Cliff Plateaus, and the sharp descent beyond· is only the beginning of a road that stretches 52 miles to the railroad at Marysvale. Before the present expensive, skillfully planned road was constructed to Widtsoe~ mail and wagons traveled the rough, ~oundabout route through Henrieville, Tropic, and Panguitch, which made the distance to the railroad about 12.5 miles. When snow lay deep on the mountains even this route was barred. In the winter of 1886 an outfit was forced to .go by way of the vVaterpocket Fold, Hall Creek, Fremont Valley, and Salina-a distance of more than 200 miles.

The distribution and growth of the population of the Kaiparowits region is shown in the follo·wing table. The figures for 1900, 1910, and 1920 are those given by t.he Bureau pf the Census; the other figures represent the me1nbership of tl;te Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, which is estimated by the church historian to comprise 92 per cent o£ the population.

The census records for 1930 give the population of Garfield County, which includes not only the settlements of Escalante, Boulder, Cannonville, Tropic, and Henrieville east of the High Plateaus but also the villages of Panguitch (1,661, or about one-third o£ the population of the county), Widtsoe, Hatch, Spry, Antimony, and the farms and ranches of the Sevier Valley, as 4,642.. For Kane County, which includes

.b September.
Georgetown and Paria, also Kanab (1,195, more than · one-half the p~pulation of the county), Alton, Glendale, Johnson, Mount Carmel, and Orderville, the total is 2,235.
During the period 1900-1920 the total increase in the population of Kane County was 243, and for tha.t part of the county east o£ Kanab the population decreased to a point where only 12 persons remained.

AGRICULTURE

33

During the same period the pop4lation of Garfield County increased by 1,368, of whom 802 were added to the settlements on the High· Plateaus and 566 to those in the l(aiparowits region. The population ·of l(ane County, 2,054 (0.5 to the square mile), and of Garfield County, 4,768 (0.9 to the square mile), f€ems very small for regions settled 50 years ago, but it adequately represents the "carrying capacity" of southeastern Utah. The number of new settlers coming in is offset by the numbet:· moving out. The small annual increase shown-about 68 for Garfield County, 12 for l(ane County, and 27 for the l(aiparowits regicn-is largely the excess of births over deaths. The families pf rural Utah are large. In 1920 the population of Garfield County included 2,198 children (about47 per cent) under 14 yenrs of age and 1:216 children· (25 per cent) under 7 years. Escalante claims the largest proportion of children under 5 years of age of all American comnumities. 'I'he population is remarkably homogeneous. It is almost wholly Nordic-the absence of dark eyes and hnir is very conspicuous. Of the combined populations of Garfield and l(ane Counties .native-born' 'vhites constitute 97.1 per cent and foreign-born whites 2.8 per ceilt, of whoBl 99.6 per cent are from northern Europe. Colored· races, including··Indians, are represented by four Chinese and one Negro.
In the decade from 1920 to 1930 the population of Garfield County decreased from 4,768 to 4,642, and that of l(ane County increased from 2,054 to 2,235.
AGRICULTURE
Powell recognized the fact that the l(aiparowits region had " but little value for agriculture," and Thompson's traverse across the Paria and Escalante Valleys led him to the. conviction that
in this portion of Utah irl'igation is essential to agriculture. If all the slngle acres tt is possible to cultivate without artificial irrigation were aggregated, I do not believe the sum would readt one-fourth of 1' square mile.
The experience of the settlers is quite in accord with these conclusions.
1Vithout artificial irrigation the food crops of the J(aiparowits region would be those of the cliff dweller and Piute-pifion nuts, cactus fruits; the seeds of the "ak" "waiva" '(wild millet) sunflower ·O'oldenrod some' squash. , and rarely corn, an' d when Po'nbgonits, the' wind god, dried up the springs and withered .the grnsses, reliance would be placed on deer, rabbits, badgers, porcupines, rats, mice, and lizards. The area of 'land that originally possessed the essential agriculttu•al featur·es of suitable climate, level surface, fertile soil, ·and sufficient water for irrigation furnished at reasonable cost is estimated as 8,000 acres for the Escalante Valley, 5,000 acres for the upper Paria Valley, and 3,000 acres for the lower Puria Valley. In

practice it has been found unprofitable too supply water

to as much as half the otherwise available acreage, and

since the region has been settled much choice land near

Cannonville and at Paria has been destroyed by flood

channeling. (See p. 30.)

After 40 years' experience it has been possible to

place under ditch about 4,000 acres of land that im-

mediately adjoins the village of Escalante, about 1,000

acres on Boulder Creek, Sand Creek, and other tribu-

taries to the Escalante River, and about 3,000 acres in

the vicinity of Tropic, Cannonville, and Henrieville.

Of these areas, which cover about 8,100. acres, it has

been found practicable actually to irrigate about half.

This discrepancy is accounted for in part by the varia-

tiotl in water supply from year to year and· the diffi-

culty of maintaining ditches, and in part by the lack,

of near-by market for crops that· could readily be.

raised. The small increase ·in population has been.

accompanied by a corresponding increase in the acre-

age cultivated.

La Rue 41 suggests the possibility of obtaining water

at Escalan~e for 13,500 acres but at a cost not justified

by prospective value of lands. He also thinks it

'' probable that by utilizing storage reservoirs the

Paria may furnish sufficient water to reclaim approxi-

rriately 10,000 acres of additional land." But attempts

to use such waters within Paria Canyon have resulted
only in hastening the destruction of lands by periodic

Hoods, and plans for conveying water from the Paria1

or its tributaries to the small acreage above the canyon

walls offer little promise. After a. survey and estimate·

of cost, a scheme for reclai.ming 25,000 acres along the .

lower Paria was abandoned.

·

The principal crops raised on irrigated land in this

region are alfalfa, wheat, oats, barley, and potatoes.

Garden vegetables are grown in abundance, and in

favorable seasons orchards produce satisfactory yields.

The annual wheat crop at E'scalante is about 3,000

bushels-more than enough to supply the community

with flour. In 1917 it was 6,000 bushels. Likewise

Cannonville,· Tropic, and Henri~vi}le raise food

enough to meet most of their wants and could profit-

ably produce Inor~ if the. cost of hauling to market

were not so great.

The pioneers of the Kaiparo'Yits region rejoiced to

find that the stream flow increased soon after perma-

nent settlements were established. The church

historian writes:

In direct answer to prayers and supplications on the part

of some .of the apostles _who .visited the settlement in 1882, the

water in the Escalante has increased in a most marvelous man-

ner. To say that there is at• present five times the amount of

water that served the first settlers would hardly do justice to

the facts.

The usunl section of the l(aibab formation is in- not deep nor in this area probably at a great distance

complete; eithei· the bottom is concealed or the top i~ removed by erosion. The search by Gregory and
Noble 10 .for n place where unquestionably all the J(aibab is displnyed was rewarded by finding in l(aibab Gulch a complete section with the Her1nit shale below and the Moenkopi above, a section which may serve as the. type of the l(nibab limestone.
The Coconino sandstone maintains a uniform character throughout the Grand Canyon district, althougl). there are marked variations in thickness. The sandstone called Coconino in southern Utah,11 part of which is described in this paper, occupies a stratigraphic position that corresponds to the Coconino of the Grand Canyon but probably is not precisely equivalent to it.

from land.

Because of its great resistance to erosion, as com-

pared with the. overlying Moenkopi and Chinle for-

mations, which have been stripped from its surface,

the Kaibab formation in House Rock Valley presents

.a rather smoothly rounded surface, which marks out

nccurately the structure of the rocks along the east

flank of the l{aibab fold. In the steep slopes of the

fold short consequent streams have carved deep, nar-

row canyons, in the walls of which the broken edges of

'the Kaibab strata are sharp and angular. The rock-

strewn bottom of these canyons consists generally of a

series of short steps over the edges of successive hard

beds.

PHYSICAL FEATURES
Several canyons in the. central part of the Circle Cliffs afford excellent exposures of Permian limestone and limy sandstone that are without doubt r·eferable to the Kaibab limestone. (See pl. 6, B.) Beneath the limestone,lies light-~olored cross-bedded ,sandsto~e that is.,cJassed as Coconino. As on the· Kaibab Plateau, the .limestone occurs .beneath dark~red sandy shale of the Moenkopi forthation, and the lithologic character and .contained fap.na o~ .the limy Qe.ds ··are essentially the same as those seen in typical exposures of the Kaibab throughout the ·.Colorado Plateau .province. In fresh exposures the Kaibab limestone of the .Circle Cliffs is very light gray to Q.lmost 'vhite· ·3;nd weathers to··creamy gray or buff. It is fairly evenly bedded,. ·and the thickne~s of L~he .·individual .b~ds ranges from a few inches to 15 feet·or more. L0cally very thin-bedded, almost shaly strata ·appear. Some of the ·beds aFe very hard; even textured, and fine gtainecr;· we·ather with a· 'ciharadteristic finely pitted surface,:. anc(are marked by,Jin~: mosslike dendrites of manga~ese dioxide on fracture .·planes. Other beds rure medium grained and subcrystalline and contain

cross-bedded sandstone that underlies the lowest observed limestone. It differs in no essential respect from the sandstone in the lower part of the l{aibab and is undoubtedly conformable with the beds above; indeed, the ·definition of the formations is somewhat arbitr'ary. The only basis £or regarding th.e sandstone as· a stratigraphic unit distinct from the Kaiba.b is' the great thickness of the sandstone, as revealed by boring, and its correlation with the thick, widespread sandstone that in other parts of Utah has been called Coconino. This sandstone is very calcareous ; as observed i'n some thin sections, the calcite filling between the sand grains is approximately equal in quantity to the sand. The quartz grains are n1edium in size and fairly weil rounded. A few of the rounded grains consist of limestone. The cross-bedding is neither so prominent nor so uniform as that in the Coconino of the Grand Canyo'n; the individual cross-bedded lenses are much thinner; and the platy weathering of the cross laminae is much less striking. In general, the rock appears less resistant to weathering than the . type Coconino and forms rounded " bouldery " surfaces between irregularly disposed joint planes.

'l'he faunas represented by the collections have been described only in· small part and contain many new species and some new genera. Furthermore, the preservation of all this matel'ial is unfnvorable for close identification. Both these circumstances have contributed to make it necessnry to leave IUilllY forms with only generic references or with the species only npproxhnntely identified. In spite of this fact, the faunal relations stand forth with considerable clearness and corrobornte the correlations suggested on the field lnbels. All the lots nre Permian and show more or less close faunal affinities to the Ka'bnb limestone.

CLASSIFICATION AND CORRELATION

Although the lithologic character and stratigraphic

position ally the beds beneath the Moenkopi in the

Circle Cliffs with the Kaibab limestone and although

the contained fossils indicate clearly the Permian age

of these rocks and substantiate the correlation. with

the J(aibab, there remain several uncertainties con-

cerning their classification.

In the Grand Canyon the stratigraphic divisions of

the Permian are clearly defined and persist, with few

changes throughout a very large area. Noble's section

nt the Bass trail, which may be taken to represent the

avernge conditions, shows 562 feet of J(aibab lime-

stone, subdivided into three zones-(1) cliff-forming,

cherty gray the top; (2)

crystalline a.n irregu-

larly bedded buff and reddish friable sandstone 136

feet thick, tending to form slopes, in the middle ; and.

(3) sandstone and limestone, grading upward into

massive siliceous li1nestone, 134 feet thick, at the base.

·The average thickness of the Kaibab in the Grand

Canyon district is a little less than 600 feet. An

abundant marine Permian fauna is found ill the lime-

stone; a distinctive assemblage of fossils occurs in the

so-called "Bellerophon beds" at the sum,mit of the

formation; and what. may be termed the normal

Kaibab fauna, represented by lists given by Girty,14 in

lower beds.

At the Bass trail the Coconino sandstone, next below

the J(aibab, is 330 feet thick. It is a buff, uniformly

fine-grained sandstone, characterized by cross-bedding

on a huge scale, and presents the appearance of a

single bed. It forms the strongest, highest cliffs in

the upper part of the canyon wall. The quartz sand

grains of the formation are bound together by siliceous

cement., and the rock does not effervesce with acid. In

the lower part of the Coconino are abundant tracks of

small reptiles and amphibians. 1~ Southeastward,

toward the n1outh of the Little Colorado River, the

thickness of the Coconino increases, but northeast-

ward, in the Marble Gorge, it diminishes progressively.

In the upper part of the Marble Gorge the Kaibab.

and Coconino retain their characteristic features, but

the thickness of the Coconino is less than 100 feet.

At· places in the Marble Gorge the Coconino sandstone is' apparently divided in~o tw.o· .subequal'ledges.

In its stratigraphic position, its very rnassivc noncal-
careous character, the large scale of its southwarddipping cross-bedding, and its lig~t color, this sandstone seems clearly to belong to the Coconino forma-
tion, as represented in the Grand Canyon. However, the line of division between the Coconino and the l(ai-
bab is not prominent, partly because distinctions ·in color and weathering are less marked in this area than in the Grand Canyon district. In the generalized sec-
tion at Lees Ferry reported by Bryan 16 the total thick-
ness assigned to· the l{aibab and Coconino agrees approximately with the m~asurements in the Marble Gorge, but, as given by Bryan, the thickness of the
l(aibab appears too small and that of the Coconino
correspondingly tbo· large, unless much limeston~ of
typical Ka.ibab lithol~gy is included in the Coconino.· The Permian section .a,t the upper end of the Marble
Gorge differs little from the sections in the Grand · Canyon except in the lesser thickness of the Coconino sandstone and the greater thickness of the underlying Hermit shale, which measures 531 feet at a point 3 miles below Badger Creek. Even the softer zone in the middle part of the l(aibab and the sandy beds correspond to features observed many miles to the south. The Permian beds of the Grand Canyon persist with surprisingly slight change for a distance northen:stward of at least 65 miles from the Bass trail, but in Kaibab Gulch, about 30 miles northwest of the upper lVIarble Gorge, the Coconino sandstone is absent; and there typical l(aibab, 717 feet in thickness, rests directly on Hermit shale. Seemingly the northwarddiminishing Coconino sandstone disappears before. it reaches the north end of the Kaibab Plateau. Conceivably, however, the $3t:J;Idy b.eds in the lower part of the Kaibab at this place are equivalent to a portion of the sandstone called Coconino in Utah.
The top of. the l(aibab .dips beneath the surface 10 miles north of Kaibab Gulch, but where it reappears in the Circle Cliffs its. lithologic features resemble· those of the typical l(aibab in Arizona. However, the formation as a whole appears sandier, and the· amount of fairly pure limestone is much less. The· deep boring of the Ohio Oil Co. in the central part of the Circle Cliffs begins in the Kaibab and shows that the very calcareous sandstone, which is stratigraphically the lowest rock exposed, continues be-· neath the surface for several hundred feet (p. 157). Cuttings from the upper part of the well reveal no· essential differences from the adjacent surface rocks, and there is every reason to conclude that these unexposed strata are a continuation of the Carboniferous. capped by the Ka-ibab beds in the Circle C.liffs.

Is the decrease in thickness of the limestone in the Circle Cliffs due to erosion preceding Moenkopi deposition, which removed the upper part of the beds once laid down in the Circle Cliffs region~ That some part of the northward and eastward thinning in the Circle Cliffs is due to pre-Triassic erosion is suggested by the absence of the so-called Bellerophon fauna, which indicates that the youngest part of the J(aibab preserved here is older than the top of the formation in the Grand Canyon country. At the .San Rafael Swell, where the l(aibab limestone ranges in thickness from 85 feet down to a mere film, Gill1:1ly and Reeside 17 found a widespread erosional unconformity below the Moenkopi formation and ~·eached the conclusion that "some of the J(aibab limestone has been removed and that in so~ne part the eastward thinning of the J(aibab is due to pre-Triassic erosion."
Sandstone that is evidently equivalent to that below the J(a:ibab in the Circle Cliffs is found in the Cataract Cnnyon, along the San Juan River, in the Henry Mountai11s, and elsewhere in eastern and southern Utah. This is the "Aubrey " sandstone of earlier writers, and has been called Coconino sandstone in recent reports.18 Does tl~is sandstone really correspond to the type·Coconino sandstone~ The complete gradation between the fossiliferous limestone of typical J(aibab aspect and the underlying sandstone, which is likewise fossiliferous, seems to indicate that they are only slightly different parts of a single widespread deposit. Limestone occurs in and underlies the sandstone, as shown by surface exposures and by well records. 1~he occurrence of marine shells in the sandstone of the Circle Cliffs and its calcareous character contrast with the vertebrate footprints and siliceous character of the typical Coconino and, together with stratigraphic evidence, suggest that the formations are not exactly equivalent. This conclusion is supported by the observations . of Gregory and Noble 10 that typicn.l Coconino thins northward to the vanishing point in J(anab Canyon, is 25 feet thick at Ryan, on the west side of the J(aibab Plateau, and is entirely lacking in J(aibab Gulch-observations which led to the suggestion "that sandstone assigned to the Coconino in the northeastern, eastern, and southeastern pnrt"s of the plateau province may form part of the l(aibab." Differences in lithologic peculiarities supply additional evidence.
It seems probable that the lesser thickness of the limestone in the Circle Cliffs and the San Rafael Swell, as c01npared with areas to the southwest, its alternation with limy sandstone, and the considerable

Studies of the Carboniferous and early Mesozoic rocks in areas eas~ and. north of the Colorado River indicate that .there ":as ·persistent or recurrent elevation in a region bordering southern Utah. Red clay· and sand, coarse conglomerate, and gritty arkose (l\1olas, Hermosa, and Cutler formations), which are certainly in part of subaerial origin, indicate land conditions, and so do notable unconformities that do not persist southwestward. In passing fron1 northern Arizona: :. to southern and southeastern Utah the Carbonif~r,ous beds below the J{aibab change so greatly ~n character that equivalents of the formations of the Gr~nd Canyon can not be certainly identified. It is per~1aps not possible to determine definitely whether the sandstone. termed "Coconino" in southeastern Utah is a,ctually equivalent to the Coconino o'f the Grand Cany~n. or whether, as is true in part, it is a facies of K~ibab deposition. By definition the name J(aibab is here applied to the lin1estone facies of these widespread Permian deposits, and the name Coconino is employed for the partly subjacent and partly intergrading and intertonguing sandstone facies that occurs in eastern and southern Utah. This usage is followed in the designation of the Permian strata of the Circle Cliffs. However, the thinning of the type Coconino toward the north, the more or less pronounced differences in lithologic character of the type Coconino and the Utah Coconino, and stratigraphic uncertainties· of different sorts suggest that extension of the name Coconino to Utah is of doubtful propriety.
KAIBAB-MOENKOPI EROSION INTERVAL
At none of the exposures in the Circle Cliffs where the contact between the Kaibab limestone and the Moenkopi formation was examined is there any marked discordanc~ in bedding or any very noticeable irregularity of the upper surface of the Kaibab. However, an unconformity at the top of the Permian is indicated by a marked variation in thickness of the hard yellowish-brown noncherty member that caps the Kaibab in the northern part of the Circle Cliffs and the gradual disappearance of that member to the east and 'south. The maximum observed thickness of this ledge-forming member is 37 feet, as measured a short d~s.tance west of The Peaks. In the southern and eastern part of the Circle Cliffs the Moenkopi rests direc~ly on the very cherty zone that underl~es the massive hard limestone just mentioned, and· in places not much of the. cherty member : remains. Where the upper part of the l(aibab appears to have been removed by erosion, the lower limy sandstones occur proportionally nearer the top of the formation.

the Shinn.rump above and the ICaibab below and a reconsideration by Girty of the evidence derived from fossils cast doubt on the accepted correlation. As subdivided by Gregory 27 the Triassic included the Chinle formation and the Shinarump conglmnerate, and the l\1oenkopi was· classed as doubtful Permian. Later studies by Girty, however, proved the equivalence of the Moenkopi of southern Utah and known lower Triassic beds of Idaho.
The Triassic, then, as now defined, embraces three subdivisions-the l\1oenkopi formation, the Shinarump conglomernte, and the Chinle formation. The beds assigned to the Moenkopi contain fossils of Lower Triassic age; the Chinle formation and probably also the Shinarump conglomerate are Upper Triassic.

LITHOLOGIC FEATURES

In the J(aiparowits region the :Moenkopi formation is exposed at Lees Ferry; at Sand "\Vash, near the abandoned settlement of Paria; in the House Rock Valley; and at the Circle Cliffs nnd in ndjoining areas on .the west flank of the "Vaterpocket Fold. At Lees Ferry, where erosion of the folded strata in the Echo monocline brings all the Triassic formations into view, the l\1oenkopi rests on nn uneven surface of the Kaibab limestone and is capped by Shinarump conglomerate, which fonns a sharply outlined basal step that may be traced for miles southward along the Echo Cliffs and southwestward along the base of the Paria Plateau. (See pl. 8, A.) At Sand Wash, the northern terminus of the J(a.iba.b Plateau, the l\1oenkopi forms the base of the Vermilion Cliffs and is well exposed along the Pnria-J(annb road. Southward it extends up the House Rock Valley as a. much eroded and faulted series of beds that coat the flanks of the eastward-· dipping J(aibab monocline. (See pl. 4, A.) "\Vestward it may be continuously traced to points beyond the Virgin River. In the Circle Cliffs· depression erosion of the overlying formations has exposed Moenkopi beds as an almost continuous floor in an oval area about 30 miles long and 10 miles wide. From this area extensions of the Moenkopi reach outward rnclin.lly nlong the stream valleys that cut through the encircling J urnssic cliffs. (See fig. 9.)
The thickness of the Moenkopi differs widely in different places. At Lees Ferry it is about 500 feet, and sections measured at near-by localities include 390 and 420 feet of strata.. At Kaibab Gulch and Sand Wash

The l\1oenkopi formation at Lees Ferry consists of beds that differ little in composition, structure, and arrangement from those in the Navajo country, .to the south and east. The predominant lithologic features are thin brown sandy gypsiferous shale and red and brown sandstone with white bands near the top.. (See p. 48.) At Sand ."\Vash likewise reddish-brown shale and brown sandstone make up most of the section, but the lowermost 400 feet is banded with zones and individual beds of .alternating red and green shale which give to the outcrops a strikingly beautiful appearance.' This assemblage of beds resembles the Moenkopi of the Kanab and Virgin Valleys more closely than those of regions south and east of the Paria Valley.

In the Circle Cliffs the Moenkopi fonnation consists dominantly of interlaminated mudstone, sandy micaceous shale, and thin-bedded platy or shaly sandstone that splits readily along laminae, covering the weathered slopes with flaky sandstone chips. "\Vith the 1nudstone and thin sandstone occur lenses of massive fine to n1ediun1-grained sandstone, but grit and conglomerate, a~ well as true clay shale, are lacking.
As a whole the rocks of the :Moenkopi formation are distinctly weak. and tend to form slopes broken by weak benches, some o:f which are barely discernible. In some places harder and thicker sandstones that are massive locally and weather in large slabs or in thick angular blocks form pronounced but generally not .very high cliffs. Beneath the protecting cap of hard Shinarump conglomerate the upper beds of the Moenkopi form a cliff that ranges from a few feet to more tl1an 100 feet in height. Commonly this cliff 1s re-

Moenkopi, in contrast to the light greenish gray of the Shinarump, and the etching out of fairly evenly spaced thin soft beds in the 1\'loenkopi cliffs contribute to the striking resemblance of these cliffs to well-built brick houses. Limestone is not abundant, but on the south side of this area, near the very ~op of the formation, a few thin beds of very hard, dense, fine-grained unfossiliferous limestone are interbedded in the sandy shale, and one of these beds, a foot thick, which is light bluish gray on fresh fracture and we~thers a tannish brown, contin~es with very even thickness for nearly a mile. At another point near the top of the formation on the west side of the Circle Cliffs the ~andy beds ·are distinctly calcareous. Gypsum is also rare. No interstratified beds of gypsum and little secondary vein gypsum were observed, but small fragments of selenite and mineralized· water indicate the presence of more or less disseminated calcium sulphate. In exposures of the Moenkopi near Capitol· Wash'and northward toward Fruita, in Wayne County, only a short distance north of the Circle Cliffs, the Moenkopi is strongly gypsiferous. In a few places casts of salt crystals were observed in the shaly sandstone. The oil-bearing beds of the Circle Cliffs and the Waterpocket-Fold belong to the Moenkopi formation. (See p. 154 and pl. 31.)
A characteristic feature of the thin-bedded strata is the ·abundance of ripple marks. In many places each platy layer is marked with asymmetric ripples that measure on the average about an inch from crest to crest, and some of the. thicker sandstone shows a very fine cross-bedding that is due to migration of the ripples.

Circle Cliffs is a shade of brownish 1naroon or reddish chocolate-brown, but a considerable part of the formation is a very light creamy tan or buff. In parts of the red divisions there are thin ash-gray zones. These colors are arranged in definite bands and zones that follow the bedding and evidently represent original differences in the character of the deposit, the ferric pigments being completely oxidized in some parts of the formation, whereas in others there is much less iron and this not so well oxidized.

At Sand Wash the upturned beds that form the base of the 1\{oenkopi have been beveled by erosion and partly buried in debris; some of them have been disturbed by landslides. In general the exposure resembles the Moenkopi outcrops in the Kanab Valley. The lowest beds are brown thin sandstone and ripplemnrked and sun-dried shale. These beds are followed upward by 4 to 6 feet of yellow earthy limestone and about 500 feet of·sandy, very gypsiferous, very thinly laminated shale, strikingly banded by zones of red and green. Above this banded shale lies about 75 feet of reddish shale, sandy and slighly gypsiferous, nnd about 20 feet of reddish-brown shale interbedded with massive sandstones 1 to 3 feet thick.

'l'otal l\foekopi formation_____________ 304
Permian: Kaibab limestone.
The diminished thickness of the Moenkopi in the region of The Peaks appears to be due to a decrease in thickness of the upper chocolate-colored zone. This decrease is ~ccompanied by a corresponding increase in the thickness of the massive Shinarump conglomerate, to which the preservation of the outliers of the Shinarump called The Peaks ~s partly due.

AGE AND CORRELATION
In the absence ~f satisfactory faunal evidence the age of the Moenkopi formation in the l{aibab region can not be directly determined. Correlation with the type Moenkopi of the Little Colorado Valley, Ariz., is based on lithologic character and stratigraphic position.· The formation lies between umnistakable Kaibab limestone and Shinarump conglomerate, from which it is separated by evident unconformities. There is no doubt that the Moenkopi of Lees Ferry, Kaibab Gulch, Sand Wash, and the Circle Cliffs is part of a widely extended formation that lies at the base of the Triassic.
In the older geologic literature of the plateau province a series of chocolate-colored shales was recognized as the lower division of the." Shinarump group," -\vhich was assigned to the Triassic. To equivalent strata· in the Painted Desert )Vard 31 applied the

To permit comparison based ·On measured sections the :i\1oenkopi was redefined by ·Gregory,32 and its features as shown in the Little Colorado Valley, the San Juan Valley, and the Defiance Plateau were described in some d,etail. The Moenkopi of southwestern Utah is discussed by Ree.side and Bassler,33 who found that west of the l(aibab Plateau the Moenkopi attains a thickness much greater than at the type locality and is divisible into five persistent n1embers, together with a discontinuous unit at the base of the formation, as follows :

In the Virgin River Valley the Rock Canyon conglomernte and the Virgin limestone .member are characterized by a marine fauna of Lo\ver Triassic age. As 1nensured by Lee,34 shale and fossiliferous limestone equivalent to the Virgin member attain a thickness of 350 feet near Cedar City, and Longwell 35 described the lower half of 1,200 to 1,600 feet of :Moenkopi in the Muddy Mountains as marine limestone. In the Spring Mountains of Nevnda the marine portion of the Moenkopi is about 600 feet thick.·

1\:aibab, marks the base of the Moenkopi at Lees Ferry. An attenuated representative of the Virgin limestone member which is included in a section measured at Sand '\'Vash and a thin unfossiliferous limestone at Lees Ferry may be equivalents. The Shnabkaib member has been traced from the l(annb Valley to the Paria River. (See pl. 7, .A..) East of the Paria ·and south of Glen Canyon detailed correlation with the beds characteristic of the Moenkopi of the Virgin River Valley is difficult; members that are prominent in that valley are absent or at least inconspicuous in this area. It is probable that the Moenkopi of the Kaiparowits region represents only a part o.f that preserved in areas farther \vest. Likewise detailed correlation of subdivisions in the ~1oenkopi at Lees Ferry, Sand ''rash, and the Circle Cliffs with beds of equivalent age east of Glen Canyon can not be made with assurance. · In sections measured by Longwell and Paige along the Colorado River below Cataract Canyon the Moenkopi formation, which has a maxirnum thickness of 830 feet, includes three distinct subdivisions. The lower division, about 400 feet thick, consists of regularly bedded red and maroon sandstone and sandy shale with a layer of gray conglomerate at the base. The middle division is a coarse gray cross-beddecl sandston~ a few inches to 60 feet thick.
The upper division, which is limited at the top by an erosional unconformity, comprises 350 to 400 feet of chocolate-colored, .red, and gray sandstone. Recent investigations of Reeside. 36 and others indicate the probability that only this upper division is ~1oenkopi and that the underlying red shale and sandstone belong in the Permian. The Crescent Creek section includes a "few bands of dense gray lin1estone" 100 feet from the top, and calcareous shale is recorded at Trachyte Creek and Twomile Canyon. East of the Colorado River the massive cross-bedded sandstone exposed in the walls of upper Glen Canyon continues as a characteristic feature of the Moenkopi and gives to the formation an appearance quite unlike that in the Little Colorado, Paria, Kaibab, and Virgin Valleys.
The deter1nination of the Virgin limestone member as· of Lower Triassic age, corresponding to the Meekoceras zone of southeastern Idaho, and the correlation by Gilluly and Reeside 37 of the Moenkopi of the San
Rafael Swell with the 'V'oodside, Thaynes, and An-
kareh formations of the Uinta ~1onntains-all recognized as Lower Triassic-1nake it reasonable to assume that all the beds mapped in the l(aiparowits region as ~1oenkopi are of that age. The beds that confor1nably underlie this fossiliferous zone appear to belong clearly to the same time interval, and they are separated by a well-marked unconformity from the under-

The lower portion at least of the ~1oenkopi exhibits a regularity of bedding and uniformity of tex~ure that stron(0J'ly suggest deposition in a large body of water. A, withdrawal of the sea, accompanied by more or less erosion and the occurrence of more ·or less widespread continental deposition, is. indicated by the hiatus in ·the Moenkopi and the character of the upper beds of the formation in different parts of southeastern Utah and the Navajo country. · After Moenkopi time there was widespread erosion, which partly beveled the soft Moenkopi strata and in places carved distinct erosion channels in them. The subsequently deposited Shinarump constitutes a very '"'idespread thin veneer, which covers this erosion surface and fills its depressions. It appears that in the Circle Cliffs the erosion preceding the Shinarump epoch cut deeply into the ·Moenkopi, removing all of the upper continental beds laid down here.

MOENKOPI-SHINARUMP EROSION INTERVAL
After the deposition of the Moenkopi red beds there was an interval of erosion that affected a very large part of the plateau country, as is indicated by the widespread evidence of removal of parts of the Moenkopi beds, the beveling of these beds, the carving of erosion channels, and the· very marked change in the nature of the sedimentation that preceded and followed the erosion.
In several parts of the Circle Cliffs the study of the contact between the Moenkopi and Shinarump shows· that the dip of the Moenkopi rocks is slightly different fron1 that of the Shinarump. The conglomerate and coarse grit of the Shinarump extend more or less evenly across the slightly· upturned and smoothly beveled lower strata. An erosional unconformity is easily demonstrated. In very many places erosion channels 50 to 100 yards in width and 20 to 100 ·feet in depth, carved in the Moenkopi beds, are filled with the massive grit of the Shinarump, and the abrupt change in the character of material along uneven surfaces is everywhere characteristic. The Shinarump may be considered a " basal conglomerate " for the

overlying se1·ies of shale, sandstone, and limestone, whiPh constitute the Chinle formation.

SHINARUMP CONGLOMERATE

The conglomerate that was originally described by

Powell 38 as the middle member of his "Shinarump

group" (Triassic) has been noted by nearly all wor~­

ers in the plateau province. A special study of tlns

unusual formation ,,·as made by Gregory.39 In New

Mexico, Arizona, Utah, and Nevada the exposures of

the Shinarump conglomerate are remarkably alike;

the beds exhibit the same range of thickness, texture,.

and composition, and at nearly all places form re-

sistant benches bebYeen series of friable shales. The

westernmost outcrop of the Shinarump is in the Spring
~~1ountains, Nev.4° From this area it may be traced

eastward through the Muddy Mountains,. along the

Vermilion Cliffs, across the '\i\Taterpocket Fold and

Glen Canyon to eastern Utah, where it forms the

plateau summit of Elk Ridge. In the l(aiparowits

region the Shinarump conglomerate is represented _in

sections measured at Lees Ferry, at places near Pana,

and at the Circle Cliffs. (See pp. 49, 50.) At Lees

Ferry the Shinarump cop.sists of 45 feet of m_uch cross-

bedded, very lenticular gray conglomerate, and in-

cludes lenses of sandstone of different textures. The

pebbles of quartz and quartzite, as much as 2 inches in

diameter are in contact with one another and also

arranged' as chains of pebbles embedded in sandstone.

Fossil ,vood is abundant; three logs more than 50 feet in le~gth, one of them 2112 feet in diameter, appear

near the top of the formation. At Sand Wash and

Kaibab Gulch, where the Shinarump conglomerate is

30 to SO feet thick, large pebbles are rare and the

formation consists essentially of coarse white. cross-

In addition to fossil )VOOd some foliation surfaces display impressions of ferns. vVithin distances of less than a mile at the head of Halls Creek and along Capitol Reef 'Vash the Shinarump ranges in thickness from less than 30 feet to more than 100 feet and in texture grades from medium-grained to coarse sandstone. Locally near· Paria and south of Fruita, in Wayne County, the Shinarump is wanting. In general the texture of the Shinarump along the Wuterpocket Fold and northward is finer grained than at localities in northern Arizona. Pebbles that exceed 1 inch in diameter are rare. The same condition prevails in exposures about the Henry Mountains.

The age of the Shinarump conglomerate is determined chiefly by its stratigraphic position. It lies ~etween the Lower Triassic Moenkopi formation and the Upper Triassic Chinle formation.. Fossil coniferous wood of species characteristic . of the Chinle is abundant. Fragments of fossil cycads from the area northeast of W agonbox Mesa (bed 8 in section above) are described by Berry 41 as Otoza1nites, powelli,

" identical with what Fontaine called Zamites 110welli from Abiquiu."
CHINLE FORMATION
DEFINITION, AREAL EXTENT, AND THICKNESS
As defined by Gregory,42 the Chinle formation includes the group of shales, "marls," thin soft sandstones, and limestone conglomerates lying between the Shinarump conglomerate and the Wingate sandstone. This interesting assemblage of strata has been traced from the Dutton Plateau, N.Mex., across the Navajo country to Lees Ferry, and along the Vet:milion Cliffs into southwestern· Utah. It reappears in the Muddy Mountains and Spring Mountain, Nev., west of which no outcrops have been discovered. The formation is exposed in upper Glen Canyon, at the San Rafael Swell, and eastward..to Grand Junction. Along the San Juan Valley it may be traced well into Colorado. The Bears Ears and W oode.n Shoe Buttes, the culminating points· of Elk Ridge in San Juan County, Utah, are erosion remnants of Chinle :shales nnd sandstones.
Throughout most of the l{aiparowits· region the formation is concealed by younger rocks, but deformation of the beds along the Echo Cliffs, the East Kaibab monocline, and the Waterpocket Fold has permitted streams to cut deeply into the overlying beds and to expose in some places part and in other places all of the Chinle. The Chinle is well displayed on both sides of the Colorado River at Lees Ferry; it forms the borders of the basin in which the old village of Paria is placed; it is exposed in Glen .Canyon below the mouth .of Halls Creek; and complete and partial sections are revealed in canyons cut into the western Hank of the W aterpocket Fold between the Escalante River and the north rim of the Circle Cliffs.
Records show that the. Chinle is thickest in northeastern Arizona and southwestern Utah. At its type locality, the Chinle Valley, 1,182 feet of strata are exposed. In the Lees Ferry region measurements of
400, 520, 980, and 1,000+ feet are reported, and at
Virgin City a section includes 995 feet. In southeastern Utah measured sections give 592 feet in Paria Valley, 474 to 593 feet along the Waterpocket Fold, 320 to 393 feet in upper Glen Canyon, and 830 feet in the San Juan Canyon. Some of the variation in measurements, especially at Lees Ferry, results ~rom differences of opinion regarding the division to be established between the Chinle and the Wingate, but the evidence shows that the ~ormation is thinner in the l{aiparowits region than in areas to the southeast and west. How much this thinning is due to

TYPICAL SECTIONS

The stratigraphy of the Chinle formation in areas that border the Kaiparowits region is shown in sections measured by Longwell 43 in upper Glen Canyon, by Gregory 44 in the Navajo country, by Miser 43 in the San Juan Canyon, and by Reeside and Bassler 45 in the Virgin River Valley. For the 1\:aipa.rowits region Moore 43 has published sections measured ·at the head of Halls Creek and in the Circle Cliffs. The following additional sections are typical of the Chinle exposures between the. Grand Canyon and the Wate~­ pocket Fold :

GENERAL FEATURES OF STRATIGRAPHY AND LITHOLOGY
In essentials the Chinle of the Kaiparowits region i~ identical with that of the Navajo country, where this formation is thicker and more widespread and has been studied in greater detail. All types of rocks and of fossils are common to the two areas, and in a broad sense the arrangement of the strata is the same. During Upper Triassic ti1ne the conditions of sedimentation appear to have been uniform over most, if not all, of the plateau province. But although as a whole the beds that compose the Chinle constitute. a stratigraphic unit of unmistakable individuality, a comparison of the 16 sections measured in the Kaiparowits region makes apparent the wide variation in the order of deposition, composition, texture, color, and structure of the Chinle beds. Within an area of a few square miles all sections may show the same range of color and inClude the same kinds of rock, but the colors of individual beds are not persistent, and one kind of rock may be replaced by another kind within ·short distances along the strike. The relative amounts of limestone, shale, and sandstone differ with each section, as does also the position of these strata in the series. Moreover, the gradation in composition of the strata and of their included lenses and accessory

TRIASSIC FORMATIONS

57

materials is such that no two· workers are likely to describe the rock or to subdivide the beds in exactly the sn.me manner. Variation is particularly noticeable in the Circle Cliffs, where with few interruptions outct·ops of Chinle may be traced for several miles. (See pl. 8, B.) In this area the lower half or bve-thirds of all the sections is dominantly sandy and relatively dark, and the remaining upper part is very calcareous and lightet· colored. The sandstone and conglomerate appear and disappear within short distances and differ notably from place to place in thickness and lithologic character. The calcareous beds range by insensible gradations from hard, compact limestone to limy shale, which ·unlike typical shale breaks into irregular-shaped sharp-angled fragments without noticeable bedding or jointing. In accordance with the degree of oxidation of the iron in the rock, the color of the limestone ranges from light bluish green to light lavender, and some beds or portions of bed~ are all of one color, whereas others show mottling. At the .south end of the '\Vaterpocket Fold and at the Burr trail the calcareous beds are dominantly blue.
The outst-anding features of the Chinle formation are fossil wood, the peculiar limestone conglomerate, nncl the series of variegated shales that weather after the manner of marls. Fossil wood is common in the lower half of the formati01i; nea.r Sixteenmile Spring, west of Paria, and at places in the Circle Cliffs it constitutes a fossil forest. It appears as chips, as blocks, and as tre~ trunks as muph as 80 feet long and 3 feet in diameter. No trees were found in place, with roots extending into the ground; the logs show worn surfaces nnd ends and have been stripped of branches. Twigs are scarce, and no cones or needles were found. The limestone conglomerate occurs as lenses that range in length from a few feet to a mile and in thickness from less than an inch to more than 5 feet. In places it is exceptionally resistant, forming prominent shelves on cliff faces; elsewhere it crumbles easily. Some ledges consist mostly of dense limestone that contains a f~w pellets; others are made up of balls firmly or weakly cemented. The conglome·rate consists essentially of lime and manganese pebbles, most of them concretionary. Chert, rarely jasper, fragments of calcareous shnle, and well-rounded quartz grains are also present. The conglomerate grades .through loosely compacted · sandstone with disseminated crystals of calcite and dolomite into sandstone with lime cement. The shale near the middle of the Chinle is unusual in mode of weathering, in color, and in composition. Where this shale is well exposed to weathering :lt· appears as mamJnillary 1nounds outlined by gracefully cur~ed slopes leading to shallow, broadly concave valleys. The sides of the mounds are scarred with innumerable runways cut through only the disintegrated surface material. (See pl. 8.) On some mounds ure tiny benches pro-
:1.8940-31--5

duced by resistant ledges of limestone conglomerate, btit in many mounds the heterogeneous material responds as a unit to weathering, and the slopes are continuous down to their flaring ba!:?e. (See pl. 1, 0.) Disintegration of the clay has produced a coat of ·fluffy material a foot or more thick, exceptionally light and incoherent. walking on the surface in these areas is difficult. During heavy rains this superficial material is carried to drainage channels as streams and sheets of mud, and in places the mounds are stripped down to bare rock. '\Vith conditions so favorable for the removal of w'eathered material it is surprising to fin.d so few areas that lack the powdery cover. The explanation lies in the readiness with which .the· shale absorbs water. A fragment of fresh rock immersed in water swells to nearly twice its bulk, and after drying is nothing more than a pile of disconnected, irregular grains; alternate drying and wetting produces a substance part of which passes through filter paper. Under the microscope most of the material appears to be colloidal. The following chemical analysis of a specimen of the gray shale was made by Prof. W. C. Blasdale, of the University of California:

In discussing this analysis Lawson 46 calls a.ttentio~ to the fact that the ratio of silica to alumina is far
greater than that in clay com:eosed of kaolin and that the· amount of quartz present is insufficient to account
for the excess of silica. He concludes:

It seems probable, therefore, that a considerable proportion

of the flocculent colloidal substance seen under the microscope

is in reality silicic acid and that the presence of silica in this

form may account for the peculiar behaviot· of the clay with

water.

·

The friable " marls " and shales of the middle part of the Chinle. are the most richly colored beds in the plateau province. Unweathered rock shows deep tones of yellow, ash-gray, lavender, purple, rose-pink,, maroon, sienna, lilac, and cream color and various shades of red, blue, and brown. On weathered surfaces, espeCially when viewed from a qistance, the colors are blended into bands of dark red, brown, pink, green, purple, white, and black.
. From its lithologic character, local variations, bed~ ding, and fossil c.ontent, the Chinle formation is evidently a fresh-water deposit. · No marine fossils have

58 THE KAIPAROWITS R.EGION

been reported from it, but instead there is found nbundant silicified wood and in places Unio and other fresh-water shells and the bones of land vertebrates. The marly bed$ appear to have been deposited in freshwater lakes or ponds.
The position of the Chinle conformably above the evidently stream-borne Shinarump conglomerate and the more or less gradational nature of the beds near the contact of these formations further indicates the continental character of the Chinle deposition.
AGE AND CORRELATION
The Chinle formation is substantially the equivalent. of the 400 feet of" variegated gypsiferous marls containing silicified wood " measured by Howell 47 along the Paria River and of the 300 feet of "variegated clay shale, purple and white above and chocolat~ below, with silicified wood," which constitutes "divisjon a" of the "Shinarump group" of the Henry Mountains as described by Gilbert.48 It is also the equivalent of the "upper Shinarump" "clays" and •• shales " of Powell and of Dutton and a lower part of their Vermilion Cliff " group " or " series." Parts of the Chinle find their equivalents in the Dolores formation of southwestern Colorado. Correlation with the Chinle at its type locality in the Navajo country is made with assurance.
Evidence based on fossils as to the age of the Chinle of the l(aipar~:nvits region, though meager, is quite satisfactory. The fossil wood has not been studied beyond its identification as several different species of coniferous trees, closely related to those from the Upper Triassic of Arizona. Most of the mollusks collected have proved too fragmentary for specific identification, and saurian bones are known only as representative of species found in the Chinle of Arizona and Dolores of Colorado. In the collection of bones and scales of fishes Professor Lull 49 recognizes" Pholidophor'U'B sp. (Lower and Middle Triassic) or Seminotus sp. (Triassic)."
Von Huene 50 has expressed the opinion that what have been called Upper Triassic vertebrates include also Middle Triassic types--:-that is, Chinle and Shinarump may include also Middle Triassic. The age of the Chinle seems clearly established as Triassic and is probably Upper Triassic.

CHINLE-WINGATE CONTACT

The contact of the Wingate and Chinle formations

in southern Utah closely resembles that ·of similar ex-

posures in Arizona. (See pls. 7, 0; 8, B.) In most

places the two formations meet as seemingly conform-

able beds of unlike color, texture, and composition

and when traced along cliff faces show little evidence

that indicates lapse of time. In fact, at localities

where the uppennost beds of the Chinle are red sand-

stone it is difficult to detern1ine the limits of the forn1a-

tion. Close exa1nination, however, usually reveals ,

staining and decomposition, which suggest exposure to

the atmosphere, and also locally interrupted lenticular

bedding. On Silver Falls Creek a bed of red conglom-

erate sandstone that contains large grains of quartz

and pieces· of blue-green limestone and chert 2 inches

or less in diameter lies at the base of the Wingate, and

stringers extend down into greenish Chinle limestone.

At Paria the top of the Chinle is marked hy a thin

discontinuous bed of conglomerate in which grains of

quartz, fragments of limestone, calcareous mud balls,

and pellets of clay are conspicuous. At the Circle

Cliffs and near' Fruita, Utah, the top of the Chinle is

uneven and the massive Wingate sandstone occupies

depressions in the underlying shale. At seve~al places

ripple marks and mud cracks were noted in the basal

few feet of beds assigned to the Wingate. These ob-

servations, added to those recorded for Glen Canyon,

San Juan Canyon, and the Navajo country, show that

wasat many places the Chinle

at least exposed to

erosion before the Wingate was deposited. They also

show that the unconformity is nowhere conspicuous

and that the time elapsing between the end of the

Chinle epoch of deposition and the beginning of the

'Vingate epoch was not great. It may well be that

deposition was continuous in parts of the plateau

pr·ovince.

JURASSIC FORMATIONS
HISTORICAL SKETQH
Nearly all geologic.reports on southern ·and eastern Utah, northern Arizona, northwestern New Mexico, and southwestern Colorado include descriptions of beds assigned to the· Jurassic. Marcou 51 speaks of Jurassic rocks along the Puerco River, but it is impossible to determine what portion of his " Gypsum formation " is assigned to this age. On the evidence supplied by fossil plants Newberry 5.2 regarded a 12foot bed of carbonaceous shale near Oraibi as Jurassic, "the sole representative of the Jurassic series."

!lowell assigned " 20 or 30 feet of red mn,rl " between 'Vhite Rock Spring (in Steamboat Canyon~) and Pueblo Colorado (Ganado~) to the Jurassic and stated that "beds evidently belonging to this series were
seen near the Moenkopi. * * * To the .eastward
it [the Jurassic] thins out rapidly, until in eastern Arizona and in New Mexico it probably disappears entirely."
The Jurassic of the Paria Valley is restricted by. Howell 58 to 500 feet of "cross-bedded sandstone, variegated gypsiferous shales, calcareous shales, and marly shales and sandstones "-beds that constitute the lower part of the San Rafael group, as described in this paper. Beds in the Paria Valley that corre. spond to the Navajo sandstone and Wingate sandstone were considered by Howell and Gilbert 54 as the topmost 1,400 to 1,700 feet of a 2,250-foot section of the Triassic. For the Henry Mountain region Gilbert 56 used "Jura-Trias" as a ter1n descriptive of all beds between the Dakota and the series now recognized as the J(aibab limestone. Dutton ~6 likewise assigned to the "Jura-Trias" the beds in the Zuni region, New l\1exico, that lie between the Permian nnd the Cretaceous and stated that "general considerations, however, strongly favor a Jurassic age for those beds which lie above the Wingate sandstone," which he correlated with the Vermilion Cliff " series" of southern Utah. In discussing the magnificent exposures that borde,r the Colorado River on the north, Dutton 57 mentioned a " Jurassic white sandstone," which immediately underlies 300 to 500 feet of calen.reous gypsiferous and arenaceous shale that contains typical J'tu·assic fossils, and concluded:
The .Tut·assic white sandstone seems to be .Peculiar to the northern and western portions of the plateau province. In southern Colorado and western New Mexico no stratigraphic nwmber hns yet beeri found which can be identified with it. There remnins, howevet·, the possibility that in those more ensterly regions the Jurassic sandstones may form the upper part of the snndstone series now reclwned as Triassic.
In Dutton's view both the Jurassic and Triassic ~tJ.·uta gradually change in color and decrease in thickness in passing from the Virgin River to the Zuni Plateau. l-Ie added:
So fnr as present knowledge is concerned, we are at liberty to ~upposc (1) that the Jurassic sandstone thins out completely in the interval, or (2) that it becomes the summit of the presumed Triassic of New Mexico and can not be distinguished from it.

Cross 58 assigned the La Plata sandstone, 250 to 400 feet thick, to the Lower Jurassic on the basis of its unconfortna.ble relation to the underlying Dolores (=Chinle in part), of Upper Triassic age, and assigned the "McElmo formation," 400 to 1,000 feet thick in southwestern Colorado, to the Jurassic and correlated it with the Morrison formation.
Gregory 59 recognized the La Plata sandstone of Cross as Jurassic and extended it southward and westward to include the Wingate sandstone and the White Cliff sandstone of the early surveys and assigned to the " McElmo formation, Jurassic ( ~) ," all the beds between the top of the La. Plata and the base of the Dakota, thus including the " fossiliferous calcareous shales" and the "gypsiferous shales and thin sandstones " of Dutton.
As described by Reeside and Bassler,60 the stratigraphic series along the lower Virgin River includes " J ura.ssic sandstone " 2,100 feet thick and " Jurassic ljmesione and shale" about 460 feet thick.
As treated by Longwell, Miser, Moore, Bryan, and
n,Pa.ige,61 the Jurassic of southeastern Utah includes
from the base upward Wingate, Todilto ( Navajo, "gypsiferous shales and sandstones," and" varicolored sandstone and shales," and unconformably above them lies the " McElmo formation, Cretaceous ( ~) ," 125 to 565 feet thick. In their generalized descriptions of "gypsiferous shales and sandstones" the lowermost beds at least of the "marin.e Jura.ssic " are readily recognized, and "varicolored sandstones and shales" is an appropriate field name for the series of highly variable and brilliantly colored strata that commonly 1mderlie the Cretaceous of the Colorado Plateaus province. Lupton,62 Emery,63 and Dake 64 set the lower boundary of the Jurassic at the top of the. Chinle formation and recognized the top of the Navajo sandstone as a horizon above which are strata of known Jurassic age and also strata which hold the position of the " McElmo " and closely resemble the Morrison n:nd which may prove to be Cretaceous. All field workers agree that the only unequivocal horizon markers are the Carmel and Curtis formations, from which faunas of Sundance age have been obtained.

MAJOR DIVISIONS OF THE JURASSIC

GLEN CANYON GROUP (JURASSICt)

Because of lithologic dissimilarity~ color contrasts,

n,nd eviClences of breaks in deposition, three large sub..:

divisions of the strata between the Chinle formation

nnd the Dakota ( ~) sandstone are readily recognized

in the field :
n.1. The Glen Canyon group, Jurassic( In strati-

graphic position the Glen Canyon group is identical

with the so-called La Plata "group" of the Navajo

country as defined by Gr·egory, who considered it the

equivalent of the La Plata sandstone of southwestern

Colorado. Recent studies, however, indicate that

probnbly only part of the so-called La Plata "group"

of the Navajo country is represented in the La Plata

sandstone as described by Cross. To avoid confusion

the term Glen Canyon group is introduced. The es-

sential components of the Glen Canyon group are two

massive cross-bedded cliff-making sandstones, the

Nn.vajo sandstone above and the Wingate sandstone below, separ-ated in 1nost places by the Todilto ( ~) for-

rnntion, which consists of thin-bedded calcareous sand-

stone, shale, and thin, dense limestone. Its mass, ex-

tent, color, and manner of erosion make the Glen Can-

yon group strikingly prominent.

2. The San Rafael group,. Jurassic. The term San

Rafael group has been proposed 'for the assemblage of

strata which occupies the horizon of the marine

Jurnssic of the plateau pr·ovince and which lies be-

tween the Navajo sandstone and the Morrison forma-

tion. It consists of the Carmel, Entrada, Curtis, and

Summerville formations. Although with the possible

exception of the Curtis formation all subdivisions of

the San Rafael group are represented in the Kaiparo-

wits region, where forn1ation names were tentatively

applied before neighboring areas were studied, the

fuller development of the group as a whole in the. San

· Rnfael Swell seems sufficient reason to select the group

name and three formation. names from that area. "fhe

San Rafael group includes massive sandstone, shaly

sa.ndstone, gypsum, and limestone and is remarkable

for variation in form, extent,· and color. Beds that

correspond to those included in the San Rafael have

generally been classed as " McElmo.'~

'

3. Morrison formation,· Cretaceous ( ~). The Morri-

son formation in the J(aipa.rowits region occupies the

E-:trntigraphic position of all but the basal part of the

" McElmo " as that term has been used by Cross and

by Gregory. It is the eqniYalent of the "upper

McElmo" of Lupton and Dake and of the" McElmo"

of Emery. For the region as a whole the Morrison

consists of an upper series of variegated shale and a

Beds assigned to the Glen Canyon group extend entirely across southern Utah and eastward to the La Plata l\1ountains of Colorado. In Arizona and New Mexico they are nearly coextensive with the Navajo country.· In Nevada they appear in the l\1uddy l\1ountains and the Spring Valley Mountains; traverses west of this district reveal no equivalent beds. 65 The term "Glen Canyon" seems appropriate for. the group of rocks that form the walls of. Glen Canyon of the Colorado throughout· its. 162-IHilc course from the Henry Mountains to the Echo Cliffs and likewise the walls of the lower parts of the canyons o:f the San Juan, the Paria, the Escalante, and ma.ny smaller tributaries. The '\Vaterpocket Fold is an almost continuous ridge of sandstones of the Glen Canyon group which unites the walls of the Colorado River with the monoclinal eastern slopes of the San
Rafael Swell, so· miles to the north, and the lower
Escalante Valley is a floor of sandstone of this group,· 20 miles wide,. which extends eastward across the Colorado River and south and west to join the Paria Plateau in the Lees Ferry region. Over 1nost ·o:f southeastern Utah the Glen Canyon group might be considered the bedrock. It lies beneath the High Plateaus, and on it rests the J(aiparowits Plateau and the highlands about the Henry Mountains. Throughout this vast area the Glen Canyon group is nowhere less than 600 :feet thick, and in many places it exceeds 2,000 :feet. It is an unusually prominent group of beds, and ther¢ are :few points o:f observation in south:.. eastern Utah from which it is not visible. (See pls. 19, A; 21, 0; 26, 0; 27, 0, D.)
In boldness of sculpture the sandstones of the Glen Canyon group stand first among the formations of the plateau province. Where the beds are horizontal, precipitoi1s cliffs extend for .miles, and on the crests o:f gentle :folds great blocks o:f sandstone with vertical sides and sha.rp corners stand high above the bordering canyons. Where the beds are steeply upturned, erosion has cut the sandstones into unscalable pinnacles, which p~oj'ect above high, bare masses of rock that rest like flatirons a.gainst the limb of the. fold. Likewise in vari~ty of architectural :features the Glen Canyon sandstones take high rank; they are sur-. passed, i:f at all, only by the Eocene limestone and the remarkable assemblage of strata included in the San Rafael group.

ridges mark the surface of the sandstones, and many cliff faces consist of a series of amphitheaters and pilasters, which extend from the top to the bottom and are carved without sharp edges. Within the r6ck itself have been carved innumerable recesses, many of them. mere pockets and niches but some that have broad floors and arched roofs, forming rock shelters sufficiently large to accommodate the houses of the ancient cliff dwellers. Here and there appear windows and the gracefully formed .arches of natural bridges.
In general view the Glen Canyon group is readily distinguished from the beds that lie below it. Its massiveness, color, and manner of erosion are quite unlike those of the underlying variegated shales of the Chinle formation. Where the overlying Carmel formation is well represented, its distinctive dull color and thin stratification are in strong contrast to the light color and the massiveness of the Glen Canyon.
In many places the overlying thin beds .are stripped fat back and expose the top of the Glen Canyon group as a sandstone-floored platform-an esplanade that winds in and out of valleys and around the beautifully banded San Rafael Cliffs. (See pl. 21, 0.)
WINGATE SANDSTONE,
The definition and description of the Wingate sandstone of the Navajo country presented by Gregory 66 holds good for the l(aiparowits region. The composition, detailed structure, and arrangement of parts of the Wingate are essentially alike in the two regions, and the range of variation in color, texture, and stratification lies between. the same limits. (See pls. 8, B; 9, A; 19, B; 22, 0; 23, B.) Characteristically the Wingate of the l(aiparowits region is a very massive, fine-grained sandstone, about 300 feet thick, underlain at most localities by a few feet of lenticular sandstone and shale, in part conglomeratic. It 'commonly appears as a single vertical palisaded wall that rises above slopes of Chinle beds. Cross-bedding ranges from inconspicuous markings to larger-scale truncated laminae, but the great sweeping curves that characterize the Navajo sandstone are generally lacking. At places along the Waterpoc).ret Fold cross-bedding is too little developed to be revealed by weathering; the only markings on the smooth, rounded surfaces of sandstone are small, shallow pitsthat have the appearance of a honeycomb. · (See pl. 9, B.) Strong vertical jointing that cuts the sandstone into huge blocks is a common feature. The high, nearly vertical Wingate cliffs present an impassable barrier except where . streams have carved narrow pathways across the outcrop.

Miser 67 described the Wingate on the lower San
Juan as·massive cross-bedded sandstone, 270 feet thick
at Piute Farms, 330 feet thick near Spencer Camp, 350
feet thick at Copper Canyo·n, and· 275 feet thick 12
miles above the mouth of the San Juan. In sections
Ineasured in upper Glen Canyon Longwell 68 describes
the Wingate as a sheer wall of massive sandstone about
300 feet high at the mouth of Crescent Wash; as chiefly
an unbroken cliff 366 feet high at Twomile Canyon;
and as a massive member 300 feet thick, underlain by
3 to 30 feet of coarse-grained thin-bedded lenticular,
extremely cross-bedded sandstone at Goodhope Bend.
At Capitol Reef Wash the Wingate is a massive 'cliffmaking bed 420 feet thick. Within the Kaiparowits region the Wingate consists of a single ledge of finegrained cross-bedded, very massive sandstone 250 feet thick at the Circle Cliffs, 260 feet thick at the Burr trail and Muley Twist, in the Waterpocket Fold, 340 feet thick at the Bitter Creek divide, and 280 feet near the mouth ·of the Escalante. Along the Paria River the Wingate is represented by a series of cross-bedded massive strata 10 to 30 feet thick, which form the lowermost 16(). to 200 feet of the canyon wall. Corresponding structure and thickness were noted in a cliff 3 miles northwest of Paria. At Lees Ferry Moore assigned to the Wingate the lowermost 400 feet of finegrained medium-bedded to massive orange-red sandstone in the cliffs along the river. The average of 27 measurements of the Wingate within the plateau province is about 285 feet. The formation is thickest along a line that extends from the Chuska Mountains, on the Navajo ·Reservation, northward along the Waterpocket Fold to the San Rafael Swell. It is thinnest or most modified in the Echo Cliffs and is possibly not represented at all in regions west of the ~aria River.
Typically the Wingate sandstone is orange-red, not uncommonly rather brilliant in tone, and it retains that color throughout most of Arizona and Utah, but in places all or parts of the formation are red-brown, and in the northwest wall of the Circle Cliffs and south of Fruita, in Wayne County, its color grades .fr<?m· orange-red into light creamy yellow or nearly white.. In the Kaiparowits region the overlying Todilto ( ~) is typically maroon, much darker than the "\Vingate, and the Navajo sandstone ranges from white, cream-color, or tan to red or red-brown, and in parts of the Escalante Valley it is pink,· with creamcolored bands. Although the color of each of the three formations differs from place to place, at no one place studied in Arizona or Utah is the color of the Wingate, the Todilto, and the Navajo the same.

In and near its type locality, Todilto Park, N.Mex., the Todilto is predominantly limestone and calcareous shale, commonly less than 10 feet thick. Northward and northwestward across the Navajo Reservation measured sections include increasingly less limestone and become thicker. At the mouth of Piute Canyon the position of the Todilto is occupied by 100 feet of thin and irregularly bedded red sandstone and a subordinate amount of calcareous shale, limestone and l u. nestone conglomerate arranged in overlap' ping lenses. At. N~tvajo Mountain the formation is even thicker and contains but inconspicuous lenses of limestone and li1ne conglomerate. This observed departure fr01n type of the Todilto of the northwestern

contain here and there balls and lozenges of consolidated mud. Like the sandstones the shale beds are lenticul~r and present. few e:ven foliation ~urfaces; in degree of consolidation they differ greatly. The limestone appears as compact gray layers, as fragments embedded in sandstone and shale, and as lenses of limestone conglomerate. Lin1e is also present as cement. Small lenses of conglomerate cmnposed of quartz chert and sandstone fragments cemented by lime and sand are present at most places within the lower half of the formation. The characteristic color of the Todilto ( ~) is maroon, which reveals the formation as a dark-red band in cliffs of Wingate and Navajo, but in some beds in the measured sectio~s maroon is replaced by gray, purple, orange color, or pink, and on the northwest side of the Circle Cliffs the entire Todilto ( ~) is light creamy yellow. In the walls of the canyons that lead westward from the Waterpocket Fold the Todilto ( ~) app~ars as dark-red shale,

In a few petrographic· slides all these accessory minerals are present, and a thin section of rock fron1 Par{a Canyon includes little black knots of biotite and magnetite. Three sizes of grains · make up each cross-bedded lamina surface. Grains scattered about or arranged as sheets coating foliation surfaces, averaging about 0.70 millimeter in diameter, constitute 3 to 5 per cent of the rock; grains ranging from 0.10 to 0.25 millimeter make up about 70 per cent ; and the remaining 25 per cent consists o:f bits of dust.
In general the smallest grains aild those o:f intermediate size are thoroughly intermingled and :form a base over Vi7hich the largest grains are strewn, but in some places portions of the rock exhibit almos"t perfect sorting and permit the recognition o:f :four to five short, thin layers that are characterized by size of grain. Here and there are small pebbles of quartz, fragments of shale, of sands~one, or of limestone, and nodules and concretions of iron oxides that exceed in diameter the common sizes, but they constitute much less than 1 per cent of the rock. As a whole, the texture of the Navajo is remarkably uniform. Most o:f the grains are imperfectly rounded, but nearly all thin sections show round grains, and in some thin sections spherical grains predominate. Etched grains are not uncommon, and in one specimen :from -Paria Canyon ne~rly all the larger grains show 'pits and tiny facets.
The cement of the Navajo sandstone consists o:f lime and dolomite with varying amoupts of iron oxides. The iron is most abundant in the finest-grained layers~ from some· beds it is nearly absent, and in places even the calcite cement has disappeared, leaving only a pile of separate grains of pure quartz. In general the cement is weak. Even where iron oxide forms the bond it is not easy to obtain a well-trimmed hand specimen, and much of the rock exposed at the surface is so friable that it crushes under the foot, and ft single blow of the hammer may reduce a block o:f sandstone to a mass of dust. Blasting this rock with powder presents special difficulties.
The varying amounts and kinds of cement are reflected in the color. In general, the white parts of the Navajo sandstone have only calcite cement; the yellow, buff, tan, and re'd tones indicate the amount and chemical state o:f the iron. It is assumed that the sandstone was originally white and cemented with white calcite and that lime was progressively but irregularly replaced by iron.
To tangential cross-bedding, joints, weak cement, and uniformity, of grain are largely due the erosion fea.tures that are characteristic of the Navajo. The

rock has a _tendency to split parallel to cross-bedding laminae and in less degree parallel to joint surfaces. The usual erosion fragment is a slab with curved faces. Thin slices whose length and breadth are measured in tens of feet peel off from the cliffs and canyon walls like bark :from a tree. Along the canyons are commonly for.med alcoves, amphitheaters, and overhanging cliffs. Gashes with crescent or semicircular outline-some of them mere " toe holes," others large enough to accommodate the buildings of cliff dwellersappear in most walls, and few surfaces are :free from pits, "wells/'" water pockets," and short-curved cha.nnels. Many bridge arches and a few complete bridge_s add to the interest of Navajo, topography. (See p. 144.) Much of the rock merely disintegrates in place or is crushed to sand as it drops to the base of a cliff. Continuously smooth surfaces are common, and. talus deposits at the base of Navajo walls are conspicuously small.

COLOR

The prevailing colors of the .Navajo of southern

Utah are cream, tan, and buff. In general, the ex-

posures west of Glen Canyon and the vVaterpocket Fold show lighter tones than those about the Henry

Mountains and southeast of the Colorado River. Some

outcrops west of the Paria are appropriately called the

White Cliffs,· but .light-red and yellow-red tints are

also in evidence. No one color can be called character-

istic. 'Vhite streaks are common, and two or more colors appear ·in every extensive exposure. Over an

area of about 3 square miles near Harris 'Va·sh, in

the Escalante Valley, the color of the sandstone is dis-

tributed in frayed patches of light red, dark red,

yellow, and white, a few hundred feet long and some

tens of feet wide. At the south end of the 'Vaterpocket Fold the nearly white Navajo is traversed by

bands and patches of red that are distributed along and across the laminae. (See pl. 4, D.) At the Burr trail the Navajo is gray-white; on Sand Wash and Cottonwood Canyons, tributary to the Paria, the rock

is light yellow, with dark-red streaks and blotches near

the top.

·

· An interesting color change was observed in Paria

Canyon. Near the mouth of Sheep Creek the vertical

\Yalls of the canyon are cream-white above and dark red below, and the sharply drawn division line runs

horizontally without regard to texture, stratification,

or cross-bedding, as if a red basal border about 20 feet high had been painted with a brush on a white wall. This line marks the top of the alluvium, which at one time covered the canyon floor. ·vVithin the rock that

was deeply buried by the fill the conditions for accu-

mulating and retaining the iron pigment were more

favorable than within the rock that was exposed to

the atmosphere.

JURASSIC FORMATIONS

A study of the Navajo over wide areas in Arizona and Utah shows that its color has no stratigraphic significance. Neither vertica.Ily nor horizontally is the distribution of color causally related to texture, structure, or age. For reconnaissance reports such expressions as White Cliffs a:pd Vermilion Cliffs are useful, but such terms as" l(anab sandstone" and" Colob snndstone," based on color and indicating time relations, have little in their favor. 74 Color is an entel~­ tnining guide in a superficial study of Jurassic strata but unreliable in determining chronology.. Its chief vnlue lies in the evidence that it affords of conditions o:f deposition and later physiographic history.
In so far as colors are significant they call for more precise definition thnn present usage provides. In most sections of the Navajo the color of the rock as n whol~ differs from the color of 'some highly tinted pnrts, and weathered parts differ from unweathered parts. The rock that is wet from rains or that .is viewed under overcast skies differs in tone from dry rock thnt is seen in bright sunlight. Furthermore, the color assigned to the same exposure differs with each observer. It is interesting to compare the terms used by different field workers to express the color of the Navajo. In describing sec6ons nlong the San Juan !liver Miser speaks of the. Navajo as "cream-colored to yellow," "gray," and "buff," in place of Gregory's expressions, "light yellow," and "nearly white." For the I:Ienry ]\fountain region Longwell described the Navnjo as "tan " and "tan and buff" in rocks that are recorded by Gregory as" light red " and" yellmv-red." For the 'Vaterpocket Fold and the Escalante region the terms used by J\{oore closely parallel those used by Gregory, except that J\1oore sees different shades of yellow in certain rocks "·hich Qregory describes as ]jght red.
It may be significant that in all the descriptions
M.iser, Longwell, J\1oore, Bryan, and Gregory use a
d.ifferent expression for the color of the Wingate and of the Navajo where those formations occur in the snme section, and that the Todilto (?) is everywhere described ns of a color different from either the 'Vingnte or the Navajo.

and topographic character to the Wingate, but the strata a,re more. thinly bedded than typical Wingate. In Zion Canyon the lower part of the Glen Canyon unit exhibits peculiarities of jointing and weathering that are characteristic of the Wingate but is not clearly separated from superjacent sandston~ that very closely resembles the Navajo. This condition has led to the practice of describing the massive Jurassic sandstones west of the Paria as La Plata or as undifferentiated Navajo and "Vingate. Bryan 75 classes " 1,100 to 1,200 feet of massive tangentially cross-bedded red to buff sandstone" at Lees Ferry ·as Navajo and Wingate. R.eeside and Bassler 76 speak of the Jurassic rock that constitutes Steamboat· J\1ountain as

most places red in lower· part and white above • • *
[having] a total thickness of 2,100 feet, mostly in sheer wall. There appears here to be no break of any kind in the sandstone wall; not even a single soft layer is observable.
In the Santa Clara Valley " the cross-bedding of the upper white part is a striking. feature and resmnbles that of the Navajo sandstone farther east."
The 'Vingate and Navajo sandstones have distinctive features, but they also have many features in common. As compared with the Wingate, the Navajo is more generally cross-bedded, its constituent grains · are less uniform in size and s01newhat less firmly cemented, it is more calcareous, it includes lenses of limestone, and it is lighter colored. But in all these respects variations within the 'Vingate and within the Navajo are considerable; each feature of the 'Vingate probably is duplicated at some place in the Navajo; and hand specimens of the two sandstones might be selected in such a 1nanner as to make impossible the determination of their source. Further difficulties are, first, the presence at the top of the Chinle of bedded sandstones similar to the "Vingate . in texture and comp9sition-a condition which has led to different interpretations regarding the upper and lower limits of the Wingate ; second, the expression of the 'Vingate in places as a series of' strata instead of one massive bed; third, the great variation in TodHto (?) from limestone and calcareous shale to shale nnd thin sandstone, not uncomn1only crossbedded; fourth, the apparently uninterrupted deposi6.on in places of all strata from the top of the Chinle to the base of the Carn1el formation.
On the basis of present field knowledge the division plnne between the Wingate and the Navajo can not be drawn with assurance where the Todilto (?), or an unconformity representing it, is absent.

Certninly some of them have on]y local meaning, for it is unreasonn.ble to assume that snch unlike beds as make up the San Uafael haYe resulted from uniform conditions of deposition.
~\OJ~ .AND COHHELATION
The i.:ieries of beds that overlies the Navajo sandstone and is terminated upward by the Dakota ( ~) sandstone presents problems in correlation and in determination of the conditions of deposition that so far lmve not Leen solved.. In the plateau country these beds extend from the Zuni :Mountains of New Mexico northward across the Navajo Reservation into western Colorado and eastern Utah and northwestward through southern Arizona and Utah to points beyong the Virgin H.iver. Throughout this vast· area the series has some features in common, but these features are not (·outinuously displayed and do not all occupy the same stratigraHhic positions. The attempts to correlate these diverse beds chief-ly on the basis of lithologic studies a.t widely separated localities, on the border of nn area exceediiig 100,000 square miles, has naturally led to unsatisfactory results. Jn the Henry Mountains Gilbert 78 assigned to the "Flaming Gorge group" all beds between the "\Vhite Cliff (Navajo) sandstone nnd the Cretaceous, and in the Paria Valley !:Towell 70 included equivalent beds in a measured section that js difficult to interpret. Of the ~eels in the Escalante Basin Dutton 80 remarks:
At•otmd the network of canyons tt·ibntnry to the Escalante, the '£eins and Juru were utte•·ly inaccessible, and the location of the sepnrutlng horizons was inferred from the color of the beds nud the nrrangement of the rocl~y ledges viewed from a distil nee.
~lost geologists working in Colorado, Arizona, and Utah have found it advantageous to base correlati9ns

on the well-defined lithologic units established by Cross,81 who chose the term "McElmo formation"'' for beds that " correspond closely to the Morrison and Como beds and the Flaming Gorge group of Powell " and concluded that "it ,is probable that the marine Jurassic horizon belongs between the La Plata and the McElmo formations." Lupton 82 followed Cross in treating the strata between the La Plata sandstone and the Dakota as a single formation, the" McElmo," but outlined "members" ·that have widely divergent featur'es and history and made the significant remark: "It is possible that the bed containing this. [marine Jurassic] fauna is older' than the basal beds of tpe typical McElmo." Dake 83 subdivided the "McElmo formation" into" upper McElmo, Salt Wash member, and lower lVfcElmo" (fossiliferous zone with Sundance fauna). The terminology of Cross was adopted by Gregory in mapping theNavajo country, but satisfactory correlation of the beds that qverlie the Navajo with the "McElmo" at its type locality increased in difficulty as the series was traced J!oi·thwestward. On the Moenkopi Plateau the presence of lin1estone and much calcareous shale between typical "McElmo" sandstone and Navajo sandstone and the unfamiliar expression of the Navajo itself made it seem desirable to describe the beds occupying the general horizon of the marine Jurassic as "undifferentiated Navajo and l\fcElmo."
A study of the equivalent strata north of Glen Canyon showed that although beds that resemble the " McElmo " sandstone and shale of McElmo Creek are present, beds quite different in composition and origin and probably in age occupy the stratigraphic position of the " McElmo " and led to the belief that a continuation of the previous correlation is likely to serve :r;10 useful purpose. A new classification was. therefore adopted for the series of beds in southern Utah between the top of the Navajo sandstone and the lowermost stratun1 assigned to the Dakota ( ~) sandstone. In this tentative classification three formations with local names were assigned to a lower group, determined .as of Upper Jurassic ag~, and the remaining strata were recognized as the· equivalent of the " McElmo " or Morrison, of Jurassic or Lower Cretaceous age. While the present report was being prepared, studies ~y Gilluly and Reeside showed that Jurassic formations corresponding in general with those in the Kaiparowits region are represented in the San Rafael SwelL To avoid duplication of formation. names stratigraphic terms applicable to both re- . gions were selected.

The 45 to 450 feet <?f beds along upper Glen Canyon nnd the Wnterpocket Fold that lie between the Navajo sundstone and a "very massive soft light creamywhite, tan, orange-red cross-bedded sandstone" were grouped by Longwe~l and Moore 98 as ·" gypsiferous shales and sandstones " and placed at the " horizon of marine Jurassic "---" Todilto · ( ~) formation of Emery," "included in McElmo formation by Lupton."
In the Diamond Valley, 15 miles north of St. George, Utah, and overlying undifferentiated Wingate nnd Navajo, Reeside and Bassler 99 found about 460 feet of "greenish-gray, cream-colored, and brown fossiliferous marine limestone, underlain by brick-red sandstone, shale, and gypsum." Included fossils "Jix t.he age as undoubtedly that of the m'arine Jurassic of the region."
The obvious utility of fossiliferous beds as a horizon marker in the midst of thousands of feet of unfossiliferous strata led Gregory and Noble 1 to study the "'marine Jui·assic" in the Parunuweap and Kanab Valleys at localities where fossiliferous limestones had been noted by Powell and Dutton and· to trace these beds or their equivalents westward to the Diamond Valley and. eastward to Rock Creek.
In the Long Valley (upper Virgin Valley), beginning at the head of Parunuweap Canyon, fossiliferous marine Jurassic is exposed on the down-thrown side of the fault that marks the west base of the Paunsaugunt Plateau-the Sevier fault of Dutton. Near the village of Mount Carmel beds that lie between the Navajo sandstone and strata assigned to the Cretaceous form low cliffs, mesas, ridges, and rounded knobs that are distributed as foothills leading upward to the intricately dissected Colob Plateau. Measured sections include nt their base a series of lhnestone, shale, gypsum, and· friable sandstone, for which the name Carmel formation has been proposed.

78 THE KAIPAROWITS REGION

Entrada, fossils of Sundance age were obtained, thus
making the relation between the Entrada and the Cur-
tis similar to that between the Navajo and the Carmel.
In the Kaiparowits region beds that .occupy the posi-
tion of the Summerville are generally present, but
vary widely in thickness and lithologic features, and no fossiliferous beds comparable to the Curtis formation have been recorded. Correlation therefore can not be made with assurance, especially at phices where tl~e usually thick, massive Entrada loses its identity, where the Smnmerville-Morrison unconforn1ity is poorly marked, or where the Morrison itself is inconspicuous or absent. Gilluly a·nd Reeside 5 have found that the Curtis. formation thins southward from- its .type locality in the San Rafael Swell and disappears before reaching Muley Twist Creek, on the vVaterpocket Fold. It seems reasonable to assign to the Summerville formation beds at this horizon on Halls Creek, in the Escalante and Paria Valleys, and along Glen Canyon. As thus interpreted, the Sumn1erville formation averages about 100 feet thick along Hall Creek, 100 feet in the Escalante Valley, 250 feet in _the Paria Valley, and 150 feet south of the Kaiparowits Plateau.
As a topographic feature the Summerville of the l{aiparowits region appears ·as strikingly colored rocks that slope steeply outward from the base of vertical sandstone cliffs. Horizontal color bands of alternating red and white, so narrow as to appear like lines, are characteristic. They make the Summerville one of the most attractive fonnations in the plateau province. Where not protected by caps of J\1orrison or Dakota ( ~), the strata crmnble readily, forming miniature ridges, mesas, buttes, and canyon walls, unevenly painted with tones of white, red, brown, yellow, and gray-green.
There are many lenticular beds a1:cl beds that include lenses of hardened mud lmnps and of shale fragments. Unconformities within the formation are common. Substantially the formation consists of poorly cemented sandstone, arranged in thin beds. Gypsum forms part o.f most sections, but beds of limestone are rare. The few beds of clay shale noted have rippled foliation surfaces that are coated with grains of sand. Microscopic examination of "banded shale" at Cannonville revealed the presence of clear quartz, 90 per cent; clouded orthoclase and albite, 10 per cent. About 20 per cent of the grains have average diameters of 0.2 to 0.3 millimeter; 80 per cent range from grains 0.2 millimeter in diameter to dust. About 15 per cent of grains that exceed 0.2 millimeter in diameter are well ~ounded and wind etched ; the smaller grains are

angular. The cement of the red shales is ferric iron and calcite, and that of the w:hite parts is calcite only or in a few specimens c~lCite and gypsum.
· SAN RAFAEL GROUP AND MORRISON FORMATION (CRETACEOUS1) UNDIFFERENTIATED
In most of the Kaiparowits region strata of the San Rafael group and the Morrison formation combine to make a topographic and color unit, in ·which brightly variegated slopes and cliffs rise above a well·defined floor of uniformly ·colored Navajo sandstone and are protected from erosion on top by a resistant platform of dull-colored Dakota ( ~) sandstone. In measuring sections and studying stratigraphic and lithologic features it was found convenient to treat the San Rafael and J\1orrison together and to describe their combined· features as they are represented in four areas-the Halls Creek Valley, the Escalante Basin, the Paria Valley, and the Glen Canyon region.
HALLS CREEK VALLEY
Along_ Halls Creek (Hoxie Creek) the San Rafael and Morrison are well displayed between the Navajo sandstone, which forms foi· long distances the enormous roll of the V\Taterpocket flexure, and the Upper Crataceous beds, which are built as a giant stairway that leads up to the base of the Henry Mountains. Halls Creek at 'its mouth is sunk in the Navajo sandstone, and as the winding course of the stream is followed northwestward progressively higher beds appear. At the head of the creek the San Rafael and Morrison occupy the middle portion of a series of ntagnificent cliffs and slopes, including, as measured by Moore,6 all formations from the base of the Moenkopi to the top of the Masuk sandstone-7,460 feet of strata arranged in huge ·bands of color.
At the north end of the Waterpocket Fold, between Notom and Bown's ranch, the land surface is developed in the limestone and powdery shale beds of a fonnation that contains marine Jurassic fossils. Above it rise cliffs that include 60 feet of massive and shaly, earthy gypsum and 160 feet of banded light-red and dark-brown shille and gypsiferous "marl," all assigned to the Carmel formation. The Entrada is here represented by about 200 feet of fine and even grained light-red sandstone, the lower one-third massive. The 600 feet of arenaceous shale in thin alternating beds of light-red and green-gray, the 12 feet of impure gypsum, and the 36 feet of cream-colored, dark-red, and greenish nodular limestone, intermingled with red sandy shale, which overlie the Entrada, are probably equivalent to the combined Curtis and Summerville formations.

PARIA VALLEY

Total Morrison formation and San Rafael grOUP-------------------------~- 475
An unusual feature of this section is the amount of lime in beds 4 and 7 and the mingling of colors and textures in bed 6. The almost abrupt variation in texture and arrange1nent of beds characteristic of the San Rafael group and Morrison formation is indicated in a section measured by ~foore n at a near-by locality, where calcareous beds are absent and the bedding is much more regular.

The flat land that immediately surrounds Cannonville and ext~nds down the Paria for about 6 miles is
developed in the lower beds of the San Rafael group,
and the steep-faced mesas that form a crenulated wall
for the irrigated lands about Henrieville are composed of Summerville and ~{orrison ( ~) strata that are prevented from crumbling by a resistant cap of Dakota ( ~) sandstone. The Dry and Butler Valleys like-
'vise have been formed by the removal of friable San·
Rafael beds. (See pl. . 22, B.) The exceptional roughness of the. c~mntry that extends from the head

GLEN CANYON REGION

The southwest front of the Kaiparowits Plateau ·

consists essentia_lly of two enormous escarpments. The

lower one, which rises above the Navajo sandstone

and has been stripped back from the walls of Glen

Canyon, is built of San Rafael and Morrison strata;

the upper one is formed of Cretaceous shale and sand-

stone. The Tropic shale, which separates the two

escarpments, has been removed 'to such an extent that

the Morrison, capped by the Dakota ( ~) , forms a

bench many miles wide, which is separated into mesas

by the deeply trenched streams that flow south to

join the Colorado. Tlie trail from Wahweap Creek to

Rock Creek winds about the ends of these mesas and

into the valleys between, ·like the course of a ship

that is making its way along the bays and promon-

tories of an i~tricately broken coast line. (See pl.

10, A.)

.

From the Paria River the old Indian trail that

leads from the Kanab and Virgin Vallays to the Cross-

ing of the Fathers runs almost continuously between

walls or around buttresses of Upper Jurassic sand-

stone. Little White Rock Gulch, a western tributary

to Wahweap Creek; is cut in Morrison strata about

150 feet thick and almost as white as flour. ·Along

Coyote Creek the next lower beds appear-a banded

series of cross-bedded white or buff sandstone and

dark-red or. brown shale that is correlated with the

Summerville formation. Some of these sandstone

beds are marked by parallel sets of straight cross-

bedding .laminae ; others are evenly bedded and dis-

play foliation surfaces covered with sun cracks and

patches of mud. They consist of very fine grains of

white. quartz and some black, gr~en, ·and red grains

and contain also flakes of green-white consolidated

1nud. The red shale consists of irregular wavy imbricated beds, 3 to 8 inches thick, the lowest beds 1narked in places by patches and nodular lenses of manganese. For 6. miles above Lone Rock the imnaed]nte banks of vVahweap Creek are made up of white and light-red sandstone (Entrada) that forms cliffs 200 feet or more high. Southeastward the CarIne! beds appear, and beyond V\Tarm Creek, on the trail through Gunsight Pass, the entire Morrison :formation and San Rafael group are exposed. (See pl. 4, 0.)
Although they differ widely in color, style of bed, ding, and thiclmess from place to place, the beds above the Navajo on both sides of Glen Canyon eastward to the mouth of the San Juan present a similar appearance; a variegated basal slope leads to a red wall of massive cross-bedded sandstone that is continued upward by a series of banded red and white sandstone and green-white sandstone. The lower red sandstone, the dominating feature, ~orms a wall of attraCtively colored and beautifully decorated rock, in some ways remarkably like the Navajo sandstone but marked by persistent small differences that are easily recognized in the field.
Along Glen Canyon the Carmel formation is exposed to view over large areas, and innumerable shallow canyons make it possible to study its variable features in detail. (See pl. 10, B.) In most places the Entrada, Summerville, ·and Morrison combine to mn.ke unscalable cliffs, but in canyons tributary to the Colorado the edges of all beds are successively exposed. On a branch of !Cane Springs Creek the Morrison consists of approximately 100 feet of banded red and. green-white thin sandstone that overlies 200 feet of gray a.nd brown sandstone· whose base rests on the eroded surface of lumpy purple shale. In places nlong Last Chance Creek the top of ·the Morrison is irregularly bedded, cross-bedded, and prominently and closely jointed and includes lenses and stringers of conglomerate that carries pebbles more than 2 inches in diameter. The horizon between these beds and the Entrada is represented by only 20 to 50 feet of banded 1naroon nnd light-gray sandy shnle, which grades nlong the strike into soft sandstone, and in outlying buttes west of Rock Creek the Entrada and Morrison make a .continuous escarpment, the usual intervening shale and sandstone that represent the Summerville being absent.
Near the mouth of Rock Creek the lower beds of the San Rafael group are well displayed. Immediately above the Navajo lies 35 feet of red crumbly very unevenly bedded calcareous sandy shale that includes patches of 'lumpy ~andstone. These beds are succeeded upward by 94 :feet of red sandstone, mottled· with white, alternating with unevenly bedded sandy red sha.le that presents ma.ny smooth a.nd rippled

foliation surfaces. Toward the top these beds become increasingly irregular in thickness and extent, and the highest beds are nierely short overlapping lenses that are slightly channeled and together form an uneven surface on ~hich rests the massive Entrada sandstone. This evidence of unconformable contact with the Carmel formation is strengthened by the :fact that both the shale and the massive sandstone thicken and thin along the strike to a considerable degree.

CRETACEOUS FORMATIONS
PREVIOUS WORK
In his " Last Bluff" section Howell 10 records 2,550 to 2,650 feet of Cretaceous sedimentary rocks in the upper Paria Valley. These strata include 1,500 feet of " cream sandstones and shales," 500 feet of " dark argillaceous shale " (Tropic shale) , a " coal series " 150 feet thick, "light-gray sandstone or fine conglomerate " 250 feet thick (Dakota~), and 251 feet of beds believed to be the equivalent of the Morrison and Summerville formations as these terms are used in the present report. Gilbert 11 briefly lists Cretaceous rocks in sections measured on the North Fork· of the Virgin River and the West Fork of the Paria River. ·Both these early observers express doubt regarding the division plane between the Cretaceous and J uras~ic-a difficulty experienced also by more recent workers.
For areas that lie within or border the High Plateaus Dutton 12 recognizes the Cretaceous as a widely variable series of sandstone and argillaceous shale that contains coal and has conglomerate of undetermined age at. the base. He says that "the upper and lower divisions can be correlated with a high degree of probability with the Laramie and Dakota groups of Colorado, respectively." From distant views he reached the conclusion that
the Kuiparowits Plateau is a broad belt of Cretaceous strata reaching out southwardly from the Aquarius Plateau and from 'l'able Cliff (an outlier of the Aquarius). At a distance of 60 miles from the latter the Colorado River cuts right across the Kaiparowits, forming the great gorge of the Glen Canyon. South of the river the platform resumes its character, and the Cretaceous spreads out into great mesas deep!~ clissected by canyons tributary to the San Juan. These Oretaceous mesas cover almost the entire northeastern quarter o:f Arizona and reach indefinitely eastward.lS

Like Howard and Gilbert, Dutton expresses uncer-
t_ainty regarding the Cretaceous-Jurassic boundary.
For the Henry l\1ountains Gilbert 14 subdivided the
Cretaceous into seven formations, which he named, in
descending order, Masuk sandstone, Masuk shale, Blue
Gate sandstone, Blue Gate shale, Tununk sandstone,
Tununk shale, and Henrys Fork group, of which the last consists of yellow fossiliferous. sandstone, un-
derlain in turn by arenaceous shale and coarse sandstone and conglomerate with silicified trunks of trees. lie remarks :
The three upper sandstones, the Masuk, the Blue Gate, and the Tununk, are so nearly identical in their lithologic characters that I was unable to discriminate them in regions
where their sequence was unknown • * • there is almost
equal difficulty in discriminating the Masuk, Blue Gat~, and Tununk shales.
Cross 15 met this situation by introducing the term Mancos for the shales above the Dakota and adopting Holmes's term Mesaverde for the series of sandstone. T\vo divisions thus became the substantial equivalent of the ·six divisions described by Gilbert. Beds assigned to the Mancos and Mesaverde have been mapped at many places in New Mexico, Arizona, and Utah. However, as the distance from their type locality increases their differences increase likewise. In recognition of this variation it seems desirabl~ to establish for the Kaiparowits region the field terms Tropic shale, of lower Colorado age, roughly the equivalent of the Mancos, and Straight Cliffs and Wahweap formations, which together resemble lithoJogically the Mesaverde. A series of shales and soft gritty sandstones above the sandstone of the Wahweap formation is here termed the l{aiparowits formation.
The age and correlation of the Morrison formation, now tentatively classified as Cretaceous ( ~), has been 'videly discussed by Berry,I6 Lee,I7 Lull,18 Mook, 19 Osborn,20 Stanton,21 Simpson,22 and others.

Approximately half of the l(aiparowits region 1s occupied by Cretaceous rocks. (See pl. 2.) Unlike the outcrops of the older formations, that of the ~retaceous is fairly compact. Except the comparatively narrow westward extension around the head of the Paria Valley, the Cretaceous area forms a roughly equilateral triangle a little over 50 miles on each side. The base, toward the Colorado River, is very irregular, for there are northward-reaching indentations along each of the streams and southward extensions along each of the divides.· The northeast boundary of the triangle· is very regular, as it is marked by the appropriately named Straight Cliffs. The west side of the triangle is also remarkably straight from the southwest .corner to the point where the Cretaceous beds swing westward into the Paria Valley. This line is defined by the northward-trendinO' East Kaibab

country, are strongly expressed in the topography.

Hard massive sandstone is the dominant and accordingly, throughout most of. the

Crroectkacteyopue~

area, there are broad plateau surfaces bounded by

steep, high cliffs. Valleys carved in the sandstone are-

narrow, steep-walled canyons. Where the sandstone-

beds are upturned in the East l(aibab monocline there·

are long, sharp-crested serrate hogbacks.

The thick shale in the lower part of the Cretaceous

section commonly forms more or less intricately dis-

sected slopes beneath the overlying sandstone, and in

places, as around the head of the Paria Valley, it is

eroded to form broad valleys. The Round and Horse

Valleys are rather striking basins that have been

excavated in this shale. To the weakness and com-
parative thickness of this shaly p~rtion of the Cre-

taceous is doubtless due much of the recession of the

Cretaceous cliffs. The presence of thin beds of s~ndy shale and shaly

sandstone in the middle portion of the Cr:etaceous

sandstone accounts for the clear-cut topographic divi-

sion into. an upper and lower plateau bench. The

upper sandstone is overlain by poorly consolidated

grit and sandy shale, which in the vicinity of Canaan

position, and texture and the presence in places of considerable petrified wood are features suggestive of the Dakota sandstone.

Dakota ( ~) sandstone, 'vith ·recognition of the probability that they nre merely homotaxially equivalent to the Dakota o:t other areas.
Above the Dakota ( ~) lies a persistent dark shale formation that ranges in thickness from 550 to 1,400 feet. The lower part of this shale contains a typical and fairly abundant basal Mancos fauna. The same fauna and lithologic character are found in the lowest Cretaceous shale elivision of the Henry Mountains (" Tununk shale " of Gilbert), and there can be no reasonable doubt that the lower part of the shale in the Irftiparowits area corresponds to that division. The upper part, which contains few fossils, probably corresponds to the Tununk sandstone of Gilbert and the Carlile horizon of the lower part of the Mancos shale. In the light of present knowledge it seems best to apply a local name to the division just above the Dakota ( ~), and the name Tropic shale has been selected on account of the typical exposures :md greater thickness of the shale in the vicinity of Tropic, in the northern part of the Paria Valley.
The lower of the· two main sandstones that overlie the Tropic shale is partly marine and partly continental. The collections of fossils that have been made indicate that it is of uppermost Colorado age. Faunal evidence indicates that this sandstone corresponds npproximately to the lmver part of the "Blue Gate shale" of Gilbert in the I-Ienry Mountains. The name Straight Cliffs sandstone is here npplied to it because of its typical development in the prominent cliffs south of Escalante.
The upper main sandstone division of the Upper Cretaceous of the l(aiparowits Plateau has yielded almost no fossil evidence, but it probal Jly corresponds to the upper part of the "Blue Gate shale·" and to the Blue Gate sandstone ef Gilbert in the Henry :Mountains. The name Wahweap sandstone is here oppliecl to this formation on account of typical exposures on upper W ahweap Creek.
Above the Wahweap sandstone are coarse but weak grits and sanely muds that contain fresh and brackish water fossils. These beds, which are very readily distinguishable from the underlying formation, are here named the l(aiparowits formation, a.s they are excellently exposed on the highest part of the. plateau · of this name.

CORRELATION
Unconformably beneath the lowermost sandstone beds assigned to the Dakota ( ~) ·are the light-colored conglomerate, sandstone, and variegated shale which in Utah, s~uthwestern Colorado, and northern Arizona. generally have been mapped as" McElmo formation.''

Correlation of these beds with those described as "McElmo "by Cross, Darton, Gregory, Lupton, Miser, Moore, and other students of the geology of the plateau province is made with confidence. vVith few slight breaks they may be traced from the type locality, McElmo Creek, Colo., northwestward to San Rafael, Utah, southwestward to Hopi Buttes, Ariz., and westward to the Paria Valley. It has long been recognized that the " McElmo " includes both marine and terrestrial sediments and that an important (Jurassic-Cretaceous) time break may lie within its variable beds.
The determination by Gregory and N9ble 25 that the fossiliferous Upper Jurassic limestones of the Virgin River Valley occupy the position of the basal part of the "McElmo" of the Navajo country, and the discovery by Gilluly and Reeside 26 of another .fossiliferous formation in the middle sediments heretofore classed as " McElmo," have led to a reclassification of these beds as the San Rafael group, coinprising the Carmel, Entrada, Curtis, and Sum~erville formations, of known Jurassic age, and the Morrison formation, which is tentatively considered Lower Cretaceous. There is no doubt that the beds here assigned to the Morrison find equivalents in the upper part o:f most " McElmo " sections and that parts of the San Rafael group are also represented. The Morrison :formation of this area consists of the same kind of sandstone, conglomerate, and variegated shale that characterize this formation in northern and ea::)tern Colorado. It includes undetermined amounts of the upper part of the " McElmo ·formation," as that formation has been defined in papers that deal wjth the geology of southwestern Utah, northeastern Arizona,. ·northwestern New Mexico, and southwestern Colorado.
AREAL EXTENT AND THICKNESS
In the Kaiparowits region the Morrison formation is weil represented along Glen Canyon, the Escalante Valley, and Halls Valley. It appears also in parts of the Paria Valley. The Little White Rock Valley, a western tributary o:f the Wahweap, derives its name from the white Morrison sandstones that form its walls, and combined with the Dakota ( ~) and the Summerville the Morrison stands in cliffs that extend from a point. near Wahweap Valley to the southeastern extremity of the 1\:aiparowits Plateau. (See pl. 10, A.) Along the Straight Cliffs, the sol:Ithwestern wall o:f the Escalante Valley, the formation is continuous for nearly 40 miles. (See pl. 21, A.) On IIalls Creek it forms nearly vertical westward-facing cliffs from the Bitter Creek divide nearly to the Colorado River.

· At several places along W ahweap Creek the surface
of the fine-grained green-white or white friable sandstone is cut by narrow channels and swales 5 to 15 feet deep; immediately above the sandstone and filling the depressions in its surface lie massive beds of firm gray.brown conglomerate that is composed of pebble~ as much as 4 inches in diameter.
Most of the initial Dakota ( ~) deposits. consist of coarse well-rounded gravel that is now tightly cemented and forms a prominent conglomerate bed. It is clear that the deposition of Upper Cretaceous sediments in this region was preceded by a fairly widespread interval of erosion. Some of the phenomena observed require for their explanation no great change
nin conditions of depqsition, but in general it seems that
the materials of the Mo~rison and the Dakota( have been derived from different sources and laid down nnder different conditions. The impression gained from a study of numerous exposures in the Colorado plateau province is that a long period of erosion, which involved the removal of a considerable thickness of strata, preceded the deposition of the Dakota ( ~) sandstone.

CRETACEOUS FORMATIONS

DAKOTAO) SANDSTONE

LI'fHOLOGIC l""EATURES

The sti·atigraphic division that is here designated

the Dakota ( ~) sandstone is marked by rather per-

sistent peculiarities in lithologic character, topographic

expression, and stratigraphic relations to adjoining

rock divisions. The irregularly bedded sandstone in-

cludes sandy and carbonaceous sha~e, poor coal, and

locally conglomerate. The pebbles in the conglomerate

consist mainly of quartz, quartzite, and chert of vari-

ous colors; sandstone, hard limestone, vein quartz, and

ironstone are not uncommon; and in some places there

are rather numerous pieces of compact clay, most of

them well rounded, though some have only rounded

corners and edges. Most of these pieces of clay are

smaller than a hen's egg, but a few are 4 to 6 inches

in diameter.

The sandstone is commonly coarse to medium

grained, brown or buff, and more or less cross-bedded.

Some beds are thick and massive, but most of the

individual layers are irregularly lenticular. Some

beds are soft, shaly, and rather fine grained and

wea~her readily, but others are tightly cemented and

form projecting ledges or rim rocks. The shale is

uniformly sandy, and in many places it is dark from

included carbonaceous.matter.

Thin coal beds, interbedded with streaks and lenses

of bone, are very characteristic. Most of them range

in thickness from a few inches to about 2 feet. In a

very few places the coal is of good quality and forms

beds as much as 3 feet thick. Macerated pla~t ma-

terial, pooriy preserved leaves, lignite, and silicified

wood are cmnmon. North of Last Chance Creek the

amount of petrified wood in the conglomerate at the base of the Dakot~ ( ~) is very unusual. In addition

to abundant fragments, many logs 2 to 4 feet. in

diameter lie scattered here and there. The exposed

portion of one log measured 90 feet in length. No

roo~s were found in place, and probably the logs that

make up this petrified forest drifted to this place and

were buried in the gravel of an ancient stream. The Dakota ( ~) west of Cannonville includes chunks

.of shale 4 to 8 inches in diameter and long thin lenses

of exceedingly fine grained green-white sandstone

within which ai·e embedded pieces of light-green mud

shale. These materials are identical in composition and structure with the marly parts of the '~McElmo

formation" along the San Juan River but are unlike those of the rocks beneath the D·akota ( ~) along the

Paria River.

·

STRATIGRAPHY
In most parts of southern Utah the Dakota ( ~) sandstone and the Tropic shale are readily separated, · 1n spite of the fact that they are conformable and that both include sandstone. Th~ even-bedded yellowishbrown friable rock that contains more or less abundant marine fossils, which commonly forms the base of the Tropic, is- unlike most of the sandstone in the Dakota ( ~) formation. But in parts of the upper Paria Valley ~lternating brown sandstone and sandy shale together with impure coal beds extend upward more than 200 feet from the basal zone of coarse sand and conglomerate that corresponds to a part of the Dakota ( ~) sandstone of other localities. A number of the beds, some of the1n almost at the base of the series, contain abundant marine fossils that are typical of the Tropic shale. The clastic lignitiferous deposits evidently represent merely a basal phase of Colorado deposition in this area-an oscillating change from near shore continental deposition to marine sedimentation. In this area a rather arbitrary · division of the lowermost Upper Cretaceous strata has been made; the sandstone, coal, and shale below the lowest marine fossil-bearing beds are classed as Dakota ( ~), and the beds above them, including sandstone and coal, are referred to the Tropic shale. (See· section, p. 99.)
In the Cretaceous beds on Willis Creek a few miles southwest of Cannonville, where Mancos fossils were found below the lowest coal, only 6 feet of sandy conglomerate seems referable to the Dakota ( ~) formation. (See section, p. 99.)
At the head of Rock Creek the beds assigned to the Dakota ( ~) include 33 feet of cross-bedded coarse sandstone arranged in lenses, above which lie in succession 23 feet of light-gray arenaceous shale that carries 5Cattered quartzite pebbles and thin lenses of sandstone, and at the top 7 feet 8 inches of very impure coal and carbonaceous shale. The carbonaceous shale is conformably overlain by 6·feet of yellow-buff coarse sandstone that contains plant impressions and abundant marine fossils like those in the basal part of the overlying Tropic shale. This fossiliferous sandstone is accordingly referred to the Tropic.
Along Last Chance Creek excellent exposures of the. Dakota ( ~) sandstone -show a number of thin beds of lignite. The average thickness of the formation is about 50 feet, but the lithologic subdivisions are very discontinuous; sections less than a mile apart show large differences in detail. The section given on page · 96 is fairly typical of a dozen or more measured sections in this vicinity.
On the northeast branch of Croton Creek the conglomerate at the base of the Dakota ( ~) sandstone has

96 THE KAIPAROWITS REGION

locally a thickness of nearly 100 feet. The pebbles are unusually large, and the lens of conglomerate has .every appearance of occupying the channel of a large and vigorous stream.
On the Dakota( n-capped plateau. benches north of Warm Creek coal-bearing sandy shale and sandst011e are underlain by massive conglomerate that appears to rest unconformably on thick beds belonging to the Morrison. However, the upper part of the formation has been stripped back a considerable distanc~, so that, as in the vicinity of Rock and Croton Creeks, the basal conglomerate of the Dakota. ( ~) sandstone is united with the underlying massive Morrison beds to form an extended bench, from which the overlying weaker upper· Dakota ( ~) rocks have been stripped.
On Wahweap Creek good exposures of the Dakota ( ~) and of adjoining stratigraphic divisions appear in the vicinity of Cottonwood Spring. In general character the formations are like those on Warm Creek and on the Paria, a few miles farther west. The basal conglomerate of the Dakota ( ·~) sandstone is locally as much as 50 feet thick and consists of well-rounded pebbles that have an average diameter of 1 to 2 inches. It rests on an irregular surfa;<:e carved in Morrison sandstone, and the contact of the qark conglomerate with the nearly white sandstone is very striking.
On the Paria River, about 6 miles below the mouth of Cottonwood Creek, the Dakota ( ~) sandstone forms a prominent bench that overlooks lowlands carved in soft Upper Jurassic rocks to the south. Some of the th~n. sandstone divisions here are hard and platy and form strong rim rocks. Near the top there is approximately 5 feet of coal, about half of which is of fairly good quality. The basal conglo:m,er~te of the Dakota ( ~) here is. similar to that on Wahweap Creek, except that it is much thinner.
On the northeast face of the l(aiparowits Plateau, in the vicinity of Escalante, the Dakota ( ~) sandstone consists dominantly of hard massive sandstone and conglomerate, which form prominent benches that extend a mile or two outward from the main line of the Straight Cliffs. (See section on p. 94.)
Along the Waterpocket Fold the Dakotan) sandstone is well developed in most places and exhibits .characters more or less similar to those described for other parts of the l(aiparowits region: Coal beds that are found in parts of the outcrops near the Bitter Creek divide are not preserved elsewhere, and it appears that in some places the Dakota( n is missing altogether. The section on page 98 shows the character of these beds near the Burr trail, 7 miles north of the mouth of .Muley Twist Creek.
The following sections of the Dakota ( ~) sandstone are representative of many that were measured in the Kaiparowits region:

In the broad, wide valley that lies between the Paunsaugunt and Table Cliff Plateaus and surrounds the village of Tropic, from which the forn1ation is named, exposures of the shale are excellent. The maximum observed thickness is about 1,450 feet. However, much of the shale in this area is covered by ·agricultural soil, by gravel deposits, and by scrub timber." Southwest of Tropic the outcrop of shale is marked by. gently sloping benches that extend toward the Paria from the base of the sandstones on the east flank of the Paunsaugunt Plateau, but the width of this belt is decreased by faulting. Southeast of Tropic the Tropic shale is well exposed near Henrieville and along the East Kaibab monocline in the Horse and Round Valleys and along Cottonwood Creek. (See pl. 21, B.) The Round Valley is a bow1-shaped .depression carved in the Tropic shale where the dip of the beds is rather gentle, but farther south it is a longitudinal valley that is made narrow by the steep dip of the rocks. ·
The thickness of the Tropic shale at a point several miles north of the Paria River measured 900 feet, but along most of the south margin of the Cretaceous area the average thickness is about 600 feet. Eastward from the Paria River along the south face of the Kaiparowits Plateau, the Tropic shale is exposed as a.· fairly broad bench at the base of high sandstone bluffs. (See pl. 13, B.) Travel along it is fairly easy to Navajo Point, at the south tip, east of the l(aiparowits Plateau, where the bench is too narrow to follow. Beneath the Straight Cliffs the thickness of the Tropic shale ranges from about 550 to 750 feet. Though the width of the exposure is not great the sandy beds at the base extend outward a distance
nof 1 to 3 miles as a capping for the massive Dakota ( ~)
and M.orrison ( beds. (See pl. 21, A.) In the valley of Halls Creek and . eastward the Cretaceous shale that corresponds to the Tropic shale is thicker than in the Kaiparowits Plateau.
PALEONTOLOGY
Marine fossils are common 'in the lower part of the Tropic shaJe but rare or absent in the middle and upper parts. Locally the basal sandstone is especially dch in fossils. Oysters and Gryphaeas constitute · nearly all the organic remains in the shaly beds, but . in the sandstone they may be accompanied by other forms.
An oyster bed nearly 3 feet thick crops out near the base of tp.e Tropic on the west side of the ;paria River north of. Cannonville and together with other fossil-bearing beds is found beneath coal beds. Parts of the oyster bed consist of shale with abundant fossils, but commonly there is little mud between the shells, and tl~e rock might be called a limestone. The

100

'l'HE KAIPAROWITS REGION

species identified are Ostrea sp., probably 0. soleniscus Meek, Gryphaea newberryi Stanton, and Serpwla sp. undet., probably new. The common fossils of the basal sandstone of the Tropic shale are Ostrea prwdentia, 0. soleniscus, and Gryphaea newberryi, and numerous specimens of these forms are found in most exposures at this horizon.
Some sandy layers in the upper third of the ·formation contain abundant plant rm~ains.

STRAIGHT CLIFFS SANDSTONE
PHYSICAL FEATURES
The Tropic shale is conformably overlain by nlassive sandstones that are very clearly different lithologically from the underlying rocks. In some places the drab-colored shale of the Tropic formation is overlain with rather abrupt change by massive brownish or yellow sandstone of the Straight Cliffs formation, but in general there are 100 to 300 feet of interstratified shale and thin sandstone which appear to represent a transition zone between the Tropic and Straight Cliffs formation~. (See pl. U1:, B.) In this zone the shale is very sandy and toward the top contains increasingly numerous thin beds of hard sandstone. It also resembles the overlying beds in color. Because of these features, which indicate that the change from mud to sand begins at the base of this zone, these inte~mediate beds are classed with the Straight Cliffs sandstone rather than with the Tropic shale.
The Straight Cliffs sandstone is characteristically composed of very massive beds of light-yellowish or buff-brown fine to medium-grained sandstone. Most of the hard, massive beds are 3 to 10 feet thick, but some that exceed 60 feet in thickness were noted. 1Vhere the formation lies essentially flat the sandstone forms nearly· vertical unscalable cliffs that present somewhat irregular craggy surfaces. In some places alternations with softer strata and fairly uniform major bedding give evidence of general uniformity in deposition. A view of the Straight Cliffs from ~the plain a few miles distant on the northeast shows rather clearly this broadly even bedding of the sandstone. (See pl. 14, A.) Other exposures show few persistent, readily traceable divisions, and considm·able irregularity occurs in both major and minor divisions. This high variability in the thickness and

CRETACEOUS FORMATIONS

101

continuity of individual beds, the size of grains, the .amount of cross-bedding, the distribution of the ferruginous cement, the degree of porosity, and the resistance to weathering n1akes detailed measurement of sections and especially comparison of parts of the formation in different areas rather difficult.
A noteworthy .characteristic of the Straight Cliffs sandstone is the presence in several parts of this area of workable beds of coal. In some districts there are thin streaks of carbonaceous shale and poor coal at horizons that range almost from the bottom to the top of the formation, but in others there is no coal at all. The chief coal zone is the middle third of the forn1ation, and this zone contains individual beds 15 to 20 feet thick. Some of the coal beds appear to be persistent over several square miles but pinch out in many places rather abruptly.
Much of the Cretaceous sandstone along Last Chance and Warm Creeks is altered by the natural burning of the included coal beds. The sandstone is altered to bright red, baked, and b.ardened, and the associated shale is changed to a bricldike dark hard argillite or to clinker. Bedding is so much disturbed that in many places it is impossible to determine the original attitude and composition of the strata.
In contrast to the underlying shale, the Straight Cliffs sandstone is resistant to erosion, and as 'the formation is several hundred feet thick it makes a broad plateau bench that is bordered by high, almost sheer cliffs. The long line of nearly rectilinear cliffs fronting toward the Escalante Valley is made by this division and suggests the name Straight Cliffs, which has been applied to it. Along the south margin of the ICaiparowits Plateau the escarpment formed by the Straight Cliffs sandstone is almost as prominent topographically, but it is very irregular in trend. Along the East I\:aibab monocline this sandstone forms the western of the two high sharp-crested " comb " ridges that are made by the upturned Cretaceous sandstone. The canyons that cut through the sandstone are steep walled and in places have vertical sides. (See pis. 19, B;20,B.)
In thickness the Straight Cliffs sandstone averages about 1,000 feet. In the Straight Cliffs escarpment it increases from about 900 feet near Escalante to about 1,200 feet at Fortymile Point. Near Wahweap Creek its measured thickness is 950 feet. At the head of Rock Creek it is 1,250 feet. On the east side of the Paunsaugunt Plateau, where its top has been removed by erosion, the remaining portions range in thickness from 700 to 1,200 feet.
STRATIGRAPHY
Because of the practically continuous unscalable escarpment along the Straight Cliffs it is very difficult f'o obtain detailed information concerning the Compo-

sition of this sandstone in this part of the Kaiparowits Plateau. However, a section measured by Gregory on. Collett Creek shows its character there. (Seep. 109.)
At a point on Last Chance Creek where the thickness of the Straight Cliffs sandstone is more than 944· feet the formation consists almost entirely of sand-· stone with less than 10 per cent of sandy shale and only two or three thin lignite beds in the middle part. of the formation. Marine and brackish-water fossils are found at several horizons in this area.
On the main Last Chance Creek, where the lower one-third of the transition beds of the Straight Cliffs. sandstone, including the transition beds at the baser is accessible, the middle part of the formation is distinguished by numerous beds of lignite, some of which are as much as 20 feet thick, but as nearly all of this coal above a few feet from the bottom of the canyon is burned, and as the associated sandstone and sandy shale are much altered, neither the quality of the coal nor the composition of the sandstone could be satisfactorily determined.
On the Croton Branch of Last Chance Creek some of the very thin coals are now burning.
On Warm Creek the middle part of the Straight Cliffs sandstone contains thick coals which appear to correspond with those observed on Last Chance Creek. In this area as well as in the area to the east and north, all the coal is burned down to the beds that lie within a few feet of the bottom O'f the present stream valleys. The name Warm Creek is evidently due to .the vapors from burning coal at points along the creek.
Along the upper west branch of Warm Creek the Straight Cliffs sandstone presents some features not shown elsewhere. In 615 feet of beds the thickest bed of massive sandstone is 60 feet thick; in the uppermost 300 feet only three individual beds exceed 20 feet in thickness, and in the lowermost 200 feet only one measured bed is thicker than 10 feet. Coal beds in this section begin 182 feet fro~ the top and extend within 60 feet of the bottom. Within tlie intervening 373 feet lie 15 beds of.coal of good quality, which have a total thickness of 28 feet 10 inches, and 12 beds of earthy lignite and coal mingled with shale.
Along Wahweap Creek excellent exposures of the Straight Cliffs sandstone reveal very few coal beds,. and the few tha.t are present are thin and of no value.. Marine fossils are found at several horizons, but the distinctive zones that were recognized on Croton Creek were not found here. The same conditions appear topersist along the East Kaibab fold, where the sand~ stone is very well exposed in the westernmost of the· two main Cretaceous hogbacks.
Along Henrieville Creek northeast of the village of · flenrieville the entire Straight Cliffs formation is weU exposed in a tilted position above the Tro.pie shale·.

102

THE KAIPAROWITS REGION

Beginning at the base, its large subdivisions and their e~timated thicknesses are (1) buff coarse sandstone, of which about half the beds are 6 to 10 feet thick and the other half 1 to 3 feet .thick, 1.60 feet; (2) argillaceous and arenaceous shale and coal, 60 feet; ( 3) sandstone, a series of shaly or thin beds within which are two or more strata of massive sandstone 10 to 30 feet thick, 120 feet; (4) sandstone, buff, coarse, irregularly bedded, in part cross-bedded and lenticular, in beds 15 to 80 feet in thickness, separated by discontinuous beds of shalelike sandstone, 450 feet. Except for the coal and associated shale of No. 2 and some thin coal beds in No. 3, the entire section, approximately 800 feet, consists substantially of sandstone, highly variable in thickness and continuity of beds, in size of grains, in amount of cross-bedding, in amount and position of iron as cement and concretions, in degree o.f porosity, and in resistance to weathering. The shale, especially that in the uppermost 400 feet, occurs essentially in lenses of thin-bedded sandstone, some of them as much as 10 feet thick and persistent for more than a mile; in other places the shale occurs in mere patches on uneven st~rfaces of massive sandstone beds. Argillaceous shale where present is inconspicuous. It occurs sporadically ii1 thin s~ndstone and as irregular masses of hardened clay within the thick beds. The weathering of these masses has given some beds a cavernous appearance and provided exit for ground water.
A plane-table traverse along this creek shows a total thickness of the Cretaceous sandstone above the Tropic shale of 1,700 feet, but the Straight Cliffs sandstone was not differentiated from the overlying W ahweap sandstone.
The following selected sections show the composition and arrangement of beds in the Straight .Cliffs formation of the Kaiparowits region:

On the summit of the l(aiparowits Plateau, about 10 miles from the south end and within 100 feet of the top of the Straight Cliffs sandstone, pelecypod fragments and specimens of Oorbula perundata Meek and Ha.yden were gathered. This species occurs in both the Colorado and l\1ontana groups and is not distinctive.
The distribution of marine fossils and coal beds seems clearly to suggest the general position, probably a varying one, of sea and land during the time of. deposition of the sandstone in this area. Commonly where coal is well developed no marine fossils are found in the sandstone, but elsewhere, especially toward the east and northeast, marine invertebrates occur at several horizons.

105

.Lithologically the sandstone and shale of the Wahweap formation resemble those of the underlying Straight Cliffs formation. In color the sandstone is light creamy yellow or brownish buff; the shale is grayish to greenish brown. In general the bedding, especially that of the large units, is rather even, but many of the sandstone beds are notably lenticular, and the gradation from massive ledges to thin-bedded sandstone and on to very sandy shale is highly irregular. (See pl. 14, 0.) Some of the sandstone is cross-bedded. In texture most of the materials are medium to fine grained, but in some places near the base of the fonnation lenses of conglomeratic sandstone were observed, some of which contain fragments of vertebrates.
1\feasurements of the thickness of the Wahweap sandstone at more than a score of places along the escarpment from the East l{aibab monocline to Last Chance Creek show an average thickness of about 1,250 feet. In the Paria Valley and also north of Henrieville, where the 'Vahweap sandstone is exposed in a monoclinal fold, the thickness seems to be considerably l~ss.

In sec. 33, T. 39 S., R. 3 E., a fragment of a crocodile or turtle bone not certainly determinable was found about 600 feet below the top of the Wahweap sandstone. No fossil invertebrates were collected. In stratigraphic position the formation probably repre-· sents uppermost Mancos.

UNDIFFERENTIATED STRAIGHT CLIFFS AND W AHWEAP SANDSTONES
In the northern part of the Paria Valley, along the· East l(aibab monocline north of .the " Gut," on the east slope of the Paunsaugunt Plateau, and in th~ valley of the East Fork of the Sevier River and along some of its tributaries on the top of the plateau the Cretaceous sandstones include the Straight Cliffs and Wahweap formations. Southeast of Table Cliff a very complete section of the two sandstones is exposed. They were not separated in mapping, but plane-table measurements and projection of dips and trigonometric computation indicate a combined thickness ·of 1,700 feet. Similarly, a complete but unstudied section of the sandstones lies south of Widtsoe, but farther west pre-Tertiary erosion has removed the upper part of the Cretaceous so that the Eocene now rests on different parts of the "V\-rahweap and Straight Cliffs sandstones. In Bryce Canyon only a little over 600· feet of the sandstone remains between the top of the Tropic shale and the base of the Tertiary. Where· erosion has so largely reduced the original thickness.

The equivalent of the Kaiparowits formation beneath Table Cliff was described by Howell 27 as 1,200 to 1,500 feet of "gray oarenaceous (and argillaceous). shales containing an elongated form of P hysa, Limea, and two species of Viviparus, a· single specimen of a small oyster, and some fragments of large bones." He assigned these beds to the Tertiary but recognized th~ difficulty of correlating them with other Tertiary deposits in Utah.

In addition to the sections describing the character of different subdivisions of the Cretaceous which have been presented above, measurements of two or more of the Cretaceous divisions were made at a number of places. For convenience, some of these combined sections, which afford a basis for comparison of the Cretaceous of the Kaiparowits Plateau with formations of that age in surrounding regions, are presented here. A section measured by Moore at the Bitter Creek divide, between the Circle Cliffs and the Henry Mountains, has been published.28

collections and reports :
I find that in some manner some mixing of lots ·appears to have occurred, and one lot from Collett Creek had in it two very different lithologic facies-(1) a light-gray fine-grained. sandstone containing a fauna of the same age as that of your Strnight Cliffs sandstone but with more marine species; (2) a chocolate-colored sandy shale or very fine-grained sandstone with fossils that I identified as MytilU8f sp., ModiolQ; laticosta White, Anatina n. sp., Oorb'ltla sttbtrigonalis Meek and Hayden, llfeZmvia insculpta Meek, and A.ma.'ltropsi8 n. sp. This list is supported by a second lot from Collett Canyon, with ~dentical lithology and without any suspicion of mixture. Now this list, on the face of it, is a good Book Cliffs-Mesaverde assemblage. Yet it may not mean all that it seems to mean. The Mytilus, A.natina, and A.mau1·opsis may be dropped out of consideration. The OorbttZa I find bas been recorded before (with question) from a Colorado horizon. The Modiola and MelaniQ; seem to be good identifications, and I have no previous record of their presence in pre-Montana beds. Nevertheless, "if there is good reason to believe that the stratigraphic position is the same as that of the lots with Ost1·ea 8ol'erlliscU8, Moctiola multilinigera and A.nom,ia p1·01Jator•is, I would prefer to say that the species listed at Collett Creek are longer ranging than bas been hitherto supposed and that the beds belong together. Brackish and fresh water species do seem, for some reason, to have exceptionally long ranges, or perhaps it is better to say that vecy similar species seem to occur at quite different horizons.

CORRELATION

As indicated by the use of local names in describ-

ing the divisions of the Cretaceous in the Kaiparowits

region, correlation with adjacent areas of described· Cretaceous rocks can not be made ~ith assurance.

A comparison with standard sections in southwestern

Colorado, in northwestern New Mexico, and in. the

Book Cliffs and the 1'Vasatch Plateau in central-eastern

Utah shows that the Cretaceous beds of southern and

southwestern Utah were deposited much nearer the

oscillating shore line of a basin of deposition than

those so broadly distributed to the east and north.

Accordingly notable differences may be expected be-

tween the deposits of this near-shore zone and those

farther out in the basin. The Cretaceous in the Kai-

parowits Plateau consists dominantly of sandstone and

has approximately half the thickness of the Cretaceous

in the Wasatch Plateau, where the rocks of this age,

as also in regions farther north and east, consist domi-

nantly of dark bluish-drab shale, so well exemplified

by the Mancos shale.

·

Careful study of the Cretaceous in many widely

separated areas has shown that the sandy divisions

are by no means restricted to definite zones with equiv-

alent time values. Where a sandstone has been

traced laterally it not only differs i~ thickness from

place to place by scores or hundreds of feet, but

parts of it intergrade and intertongue with the con-

tiguous shale, and in many places the whole sand

body wedges out to nothing. It many places marine

fossils are abundant; elsewhere they are rare or are

not diagnostic. These assemblages of invertebrate

forms indicate the· presence of 1nuddy sea bottoms and

sandy sea bottoms and show repeated changes later-

ally and vertically from marine to brackish and fresh-

water sedim~nts. Because of these conditions the

correlation of the sand bodies in the Cretaceous pre-

sents many di~culties.

THE KAIPAROWITS REGION

TERTIARY ROCKS
WASATCH FORMATION (EOCENE)
DISTRIDUTION AND TOPOGRAPHIC EXPRESSION
Beds of early Tertiary (Eocene) age are continuously displayed in the magnificent escarpments that border the Paunsaugunt, Table Cliff, and Aquarius Plateaus. They appear also in the broken slopes of Canaan Mountain, an outlier of the Table Cliff Plateau. For many miles around the heads of the Paria &nd Escalante Valleys .they stand as an ·upper tier of a great· amphitheater-a broken wall composed of squarefluted columns of high proportions. From below the Table Cliff Plateau they are seen to consist of a mass of limestone 1,000 feet thick with flat top and vertical sides resting on a sloping dull-colored base. It is surprising to find so enormous a block so symmetrically carved and so delicately colored, .but similar largescale erosion features occur wherever these limestones are exposed---all about the Paunsaugunt Plat~au, in the walls of the Aquarius Plateau, and at Canaan· Peak. Detailed erosion. features· are likewise striking and unusual. The maze o£ columns, pinnacles, and tables splashed with. color that makes Bryce Canyon attractive is repeated many times in the eroded walls of the southern High Plateaus. (See pl. 15.) All the Tertiary beds that are recognized in this region are now assigned to the Wasatch formation.
PREVIOUS STUDIES
Dutton 3~ describes the Paunsaugunt as a '.'tabular block of lower Eocene beds, .exceedingly simple in its structure," which aside from its " marvelous color and sculptural forms presents little matter for special remark." He mapped the top of the Paunsaugunt and also that of the Aquarius and Table Cliff Plateaus and of Canaan Peak (Kaiparowits Peak) as limestone of Tertiary age, here and there overlain by lava. In Dutton's view "the Tertiary system of the plateau c~untry is lacustrine throughout, -\vith the. exception of ~ few layers near. the base of the system which have yielded estuarine fossils." From ::t maximum thickness of more than 8,000 feet in. the vicinity of the Wasatch and Uinta Mountains " the deposits originally laid down in an enormous Eocene lake, which must have had an area more than twice that of Lake Superior and may even have exceeded that of the .five great Canadian lakes combined," decreased in thickness southeastward and southwestward to shore lines in New Mexico and Nevada.
Dutton noted that the Eocene beds o£ the southern plateaus, Markagunt and P.aunsaugunt, were t.o be

the same age as those farther no·rth and northeast, and they are therefore all referred to the Wasatch. The difference in thickness is possibly the result of surface erosion and of the relief of the underlying Cretaceous beds, but the lowest beds are not lithologic equivalents, and the great differences in sequence, in composition, and in the proportionate amounts of limestone, shale, sandstone, and lignite make it possible that the Tertiary strata of Utah were deposited in several basins with here and there overlapping rims. It seems unnecessary to follow Dutton in assuming that such widely separated and unlike sediments as the carbonaceous shale and sandstone of the Price River, the dense pure limestone of Table Cliff, and the quartz sandstone and clay shale of Chuska Mountain in the Navajo country were laid down· contemporaneously in a single large depression.
UNCONFORMITY AT BASE OF EOCENE
The well-known unconformity at the base of the Eocene beds in northern and central Utah has been traced to the Kaiparowits region along the face of the Paunsaugunt, Table Cliff, and Aquarius Plateaus. In places the beds above and below are parallel, and their separation is marked only by accumulations of gravel and by abrupt change from dull-colored marine shale and sandstone to pink or white fresh-water 'limestone. Elsewhere the unconformity is a mature surface of erosion that is developed indiscriminately on flat-lying, tilted, and folded strata of different age and different con1position. At Canaan Peak the Eocene beds horizontally overlie the upturned strata of the East Kaibab fold, in which the youngest Cretaceous sediments are involved. Northward along the Aquarius Plateau the Eocene rests on progressively lower subdivisions of the Cretaceous and truncates the

Dakota ( ~) and San Rafael beds that are upturned in the Pine Creek fold. Between Sand Creek and Boulder Creek only the lowest beds of the San Rafael group remain, and on the west flank of the Waterpocket Fold the Eocene rests on the Navajo sandstone. During the time interval thus indicated more than 5,000 feet of sediments were locally removed.
QUATERNARY DEPOSITS
The sediments in the l{aiparowits region that date from Quaternary time are chiefly alluvial depqsits in valleys, on slopes, and on top of the higher plateaus. The accumulations of eolian sand are small and localized (p. 145), and incipient glaciation on the Paunsaugunt and Aquarius Plateaus has left only scattered boulders and inconspicuous remains. Swamp deposits appear along the northern headwaters of the Escalante River and about the glacial lakes on the Aquarius Plateau. During the last half century the alluvial fill of many valleys has been scoured out by the streams.
IGNEOUS ROCKS
Unlike other large parts of the plateau province, the l{aiparowits region is remarkably free from igneous rocks. No deep-seated masses, no dikes, and no volcanic cones have been found. The only products of igneous activity are lava flows on the Table Cliff and Paunsaugunt Plateaus-remnant outliers of much greater flows on the Markagunt and Aquarius Plateaus. As described by Dutton 89 these lavas are basalt and were erupted from widely distributed vents at different periods during Tertiary and more recent times. A flow in Johnson Canyon overlies alluvial deposits and has interfered with the course of the stream.

The first of these, D, is a monoclinul, with a throw of a few hundred feet only to the west. From this fold the beds rise at an angle of from 2° to 4° to the west-southwest, until the point JJJ is reached, when they dip suddenly to the west again, at an angle as high in some places as 30°. After dropping about 1,500 feet they assume a nearly horizontal position and apparently continue to the Last Bluff with no further disturbance.

From Dutton's viewpoint only the northeast face of the Kaiparowits Plateau was visible. Accordingly the plateau appeared to be composed of strata " quite horizontal." The structural features within the mass were not observed.

·the Dakota ( ~) sandstone were still present over the summit of the upwarp it woul(J. have an altitude of about 11,300 feet. Northward along the axis of the upwarp a relatively shallow sag lies between the high point in the Circle Cliffs and ~ second high point in the Miners Mountain swell. Southward the crest of the upwarp plunges gradually to about 6,500 feet a short distance south of the Colorado River. Southwestward the dip slopes on the hard Jurassic sandstone form a gentle descent, interrupted by low anticlines and synclines, that leads toward the !(aiparowits downwarp, whose lowest part is 30 to 40 miles distant. After crossing the belt of weak Upper Jurassic rocks in the Escalante Valley this dip slope continues to the hard sandstone of the Kaiparowits Plateau.
Erosion has breached the high part of the Circle Cliffs upwarp and produced a broad elliptical valley in the. soft Triassic shale. (See pls. 8, B; 22, B.)
This depression, which is surrounded on all sides by inward-facing cliffs of massive Jurassic sandstone, is not hollowed smoothly into a basin but contains in its. central part a broad, dome-shaped elevation that is upheld by the hard Permian limestone and surmounted in two or three places by outliers of hard Triassic conglomerate that reach an altitude as great as that of the top of the surrounding sandstone rim.
HARRIS SYNCLINE
In the central part of T. 36 S., R. 5 E., a southwardtrending shallow syncline crosses Harris Creek, a tributary of the Escalante River. The structure is clearly shown in the basal. sandy, gypsiferous upper Jurassic beds that overlie the Navajo sandstone. On the east side of the syncline the dip is 3° to 10°, but on the west it is as much as 20°. The southward plunge of the syncline is more than 150 feet to the mile.
COLLETT ANTICLINE
The Collett anticline is a minor elevation of the beds on the west side of the Harris syncline.· It is locally rather prominent on account of the conti·ol it exerts in the distribution of the rocks at the surface, having produced a nearly continuous extension of the Navajo sandstone from the broad area of its outcrop north of Harris Wash to. Collett Creek on the south. As measured in the stratified rocks that overlie theNavajo the inclination of the beds in the anticline is 5° to 20° on the east flank and 4° to 5° on the west flank.
ESCALANTE MONOCLINE
The Escalante monocline is locally a very prominent structural feature. As viewed from Escalante it stands as a wall of steeply upturned sandstone bordered by lower-lying surfaces of gypsum, shale, and alluvium, in the midst of which the village is placed.

Directly across the wall the Escalante River has cut a deep, narrow trench, the beginning of a continuous canyon that leads to the Colorado River. The change in topography from a broad, open valley to a precipitous-sided trench is abrupt. South of Escalante the monocline plunges southward and seems to disappear within a few miles. Northward, however, its western flank for a distance of about 8 miles is exposed in the bank of Pine Creek. Farther north, on Sand Creek, the fold has been beveled by pre-Tertiary erosion, and as a series of truncated beds it disappears beneath the limestone and lava of the Aquarius Plateau. Unlike the beds involved in the Waterpocket flexure the Jurassic beds exposed in the eastern limb of the Escalante monocline have gentle dips that extend for but a few miles before becoming merged with the general regional structure. But the strata that form the westward flank dip sharply downward-30° to 36°
nalong Pine Creek, 16° on Deadman Creek-and bring
the Navajo sandstone (Jurassic and the Straight Cliffs sandstone (Upper Cretaceous) into the same horizontal plane. The displacement amounts to more than 2,000 feet within a horizontal distance of about 2 miles. In its regional relations the Escalante monocline is an interruption of the general dip of the beds between the crest of the "\¥aterpocket flexure and the base of the Aquarius and Table Cliff Plateaus-a huge wrinkle in an otherwise continuous westward-dipping sandstone.
KAIPA~OWITS DOWNWARP
The great southward projection of the Cretaceous rocks that compose the Kaiparowits Plateau is explained by the structural depression of the plateau area. Northeastward from the base of the plateau there is an essentially uniform rise of the rocks to the summit of the Circle Cliffs upwarp, and there is consequently no real line of division between the areas designated downwarp and upwarp. A convenient and natural division, however, may be made along the line of the Cretaceous outcrops marked-by the Straight Cliffs. On the south and southeast the rock beds rise gently towal,'d the Colorado River, and there are no clearly defined structural liinits of the downwarp in this direction. This- part of the downwarp is characterized by gentle undulations, whose axes converge· toward the center of the depressed area. Along Wahweap Creek the north end of the Echo monqcline is a more prominent rock fold that ~arks out the Paria platform on the west from the structurally slightly lower area to the east. On the west the Kaiparowits downwarp is sharply bounded by the East Kaibab monocline, whose main axis, marked by the course of the House Rock Valley and Cottonwood Creek, trends north-northeast. North of the " Gut" this trend gradually changes to the northwest, and th~ dip of

northern part of the downwarped area has a definitely synclinal strl.lCture, with an axis that trends northwest. As the axis of the syncline trends almost exactly beneath Table Cliff, it is called the Table Cliff syncline, although the 'fertiary rocks of the plateau are not at all involved in the structure.
In most places the surface of the Cretaceous sandstone platforms accurately reflects the rock structure. From the crest of the Straight Cliffs a dip slope is gently inclined to the southwest. (See pl. 21, .A.) 'rhis dip is local.ly much steepened on approaching

as known, the axis of the anticline is only 8 or 10 miles long.
CROTON SYNCLINE
The Croton syncline borders the Rock Creek anticline on the west and trends almost due north along the Croton Branch of Last Chance Creek. On the east side of the syncline the beds dip 8° or 9°, but on the west they have only a slight inclination toward. the axis of the syncline, and within a short distance they reassume the regional slope toward the southwest.

the Table Cliff syncline, as indicated topographically by the development of hogback ridges on the Wahweap sandstone east of Table Cliff and Canaan Peak.
A view from any prominent point, such as the ~rest of the Cretaceous hogbacks on the East l(aibab monocline, shows clearly the gently basin-like structure of the central part of the l(aiparowits do~vnwarp. The lowest parts of the basin in the vicinity of Canaan Peak and along the headwaters of Wahweap Creek are occupied by soft rocks of the I)::aiparowits formation, and the maximum thickness of this forn1ation lies where the underlying sandstone ·is most depressed.

LAST CHANCE SYNCLINE
Throughout almost its entire course Last Chance Creek follows the axis of a gentle but well:defined syn- · cline, the east limb of which is formed by the general regional dip of the rocks, and the west limb by a gentle rise toward the crest of the Smoky Mountain antidine. Locally dips of as much as 5° are observed, but in general they do not exceed 2° or 3°. The axis of the syncline plunges northwestward at an average rate o:f about 65 feet to the mile, the direction of slqpe being opposite to t~at of the stream's flow.

The dip slope on t,he top of the vVahweap sandstone rises gently but in a clearly defined manner on the northeast, east, southeast, and south. On the west lies the steeply upturned sandstone of the East Kaibab monocline.
The top of the Straight Cliffs sandstone forms a broad platform that extends outward from the Last Chance Cliffs. Except in part 'of the area along Last Chance Creek, where the i.·ocks of this division hav~ been extensively altered by the burning of the included coals and have been much dissected, the irregularities of the platform define the gentle anticlinal and synclinal· warpings that are superimpose.d on the regional structure in this part of the downwarp.

SMOKY MOUNTAIN ANTICLINE
The gently rounded divide· on the surface of the Straight Cliffs sandstone plateau and the Grand Bench defines an anticlinal axis that passes through Smoky Mountain. The anticline may be designated conveniently the Smoky Mountain anticline. Between the headwaters of Warm and Last Chance Creeks this axis is very sharply marked, and. the dip slope from the top of the sandstone is very readily observable with the eye. Farther south the axis of the anticline is less clearly defined. Its trend is parallel to that of the synclines on each side, and like them it plunges gently northwestward.

South of the Straight Cliffs escarpment the platform known as the Grand Bench, formed mainly by massive Morrison conglomerate, shows a continuation of structural features observed in the rocks farther north.
ROCK CREEK ANTICLINE
A prominent southeastward-trending. anticline is observed on the headwaters of Rock Creek, about 6 miles north of the Colorado River, and intersects the

As defined by steep northeasterly dips at the head of the ·Paria Valley and by similarly steep southwesterly dips that are marked by the northwestward-trending hogback ridges along the headwaters of the Escalante, the Table Cliff syncline marks the bottom of the Kaiparowits downwarp.

EAST KAIBAB MONOCLINE
The East Kaibab monocline justly ranks as a major structural feature of the plateau country. It extends without interruption from the Colorado River northward to Table Cliff, a distance of about 120 miles, ancl defines the eastern border of the Kaibab Plateau. It raises the rocks on the west several thousand feet above those on the east, and through its influence in guiding erosion the present stratigraphic formations

time and that the erosion represented by the preWasatch unconformity may be referred to early Eocene time; represented by the Animas (Eo·Cene ~) , Torrejon, and Puerco formations in the San Juan area, to the southeast. Evidence points rather strongly to a common age for the disturbances that produced the monoclinal folds of the plateau country. In several places rocks as young· as the Mesaverde Cretaceous, which are included in the folding, are preserved from subsequent erosion, but in most places the pr~-W asatch or subsequent denudation has planed the surface down to rocks that are older than the . l{aiparowits beds. Gregory 12 notes that very late Cretaceous rocks (the so-called Laramie beds of that area) are included in the deformation of the Defiance monocline in eastern Arizona, whereas in southern Utah the beveled Mesozoic beds are unconformably covered by Eocene beds. This indicates, then, that the general period of disturbance in the plateau country that produced the monocline is post-Fruitland in age and sufficiently older than the Wasatch to have permitted widespread and deep erosion of the underlying rocks.

KAIBAB UPWARP

The l{aibab upwarp includes the elevated strata on the west side of the East l{aibab monocline. The part of the upwarp that is included in southern Utah represents the northward-sloping border qf the uplift, which reaches its greatest altitude far to the south, in the Grand Canyon district. The l{aibab limestone is exposed at the surface for about 10 miles north of the Utah-Arizona boundary, and beyond it successive outcrops of the younger beds appear in order. The Jurassic sandstone forms the eastward-trending escarpments known as the Vermilion and White Cliffs. The Cretaceous beds occupy the surface at the headwaters of the Paria Valley.

PAUNSAUGUNT FAULT
On the east side of the Paunsaugunt Plateau, but at a distance of 1 to 3 miles from the Pink Cliffs, which border the plateau, lies a prominent northward-trending fault with uplift on the east, known as the East Paunsaugunt fault. On t~?-e west side of the fault are Upper Cretaceous sandstones that belong to the Wahweap and Straight Cliffs formations, and on the east are Cretaceous beds that belong to the Tropic shale and the Dakota ( ~) sandstone, whereas farther south beds of the Upper Jurassic Carmel formation are found in contact with the Upper C~etaceous sandstone. Few places were observed where the total throw of the fault could be determined readily, but on Willis Creek the displacement apparently amounts to at least 1,500 feet. Where the Paria

Thus, along most streams there is a succession of relatively gentle and relatively steep gradients. The interrupted profiles and steep gradients of the streams are indications of the rapid downward erosion that is taking place along their courses. Rapid erosion is indicated also by the characteristically large load

In the Circle Cliffs dome the streams flow radially outward down dip slopes, and from the crest of theWaterpocket Fold streams follow tilted strata to Halls Creek and to the Escalante River. The East Fork of the Sevier River flows northward in nccord with the inclination of the beds that compose the Paunsaugunt Plateau. vVahweap, 'Varm, and Last· Chance Creeks, nlthough they flow in a direction opposite to the clip of the beds, occupy shallow synclines. Some streams follow the slope of hard-rock platforms, and many of them have established short subsequent courses along the strike of easily eroded flat-lying or tilted beds or even on the .crests of monoclinal folds.
But although much of the minor drainage is locally well adjusted to structure t11e larger streams are remarkably independent of structural control. They flow in nnd out of cliffs, cut through mesas, transect monoclines, cross fa,ults from the downthrown to the 11pthrown sides, and make their way through tilted strata without regard to the direction of elip..

rocks. If the Escalante River were lontrolled by structure it should follow the belt of weak rocks in front of the Straight Cliffs, and the Paria River would have been spared the prodigious task of trenching the East Kaibab monocline and the Paria Plateau.
Powell, Gilbert, and Dutton repeatedly call attention to the discordant relations of the tributaries to the Colorado. Dutton 6 says: .
They rush into h cliff or into a ri§ing slope of the strata as if they were only banks of fog or smoke. It matters not which way the strata clip, the streams have ways of their own.
This seemingly strange behavior was interpreted as evidence of antecedent drainage. Concerning the Green River and its tributaries that are intrenched in the folds of the Uinta Mountains, Powell 7 says: " The streams were there before the mountains were made
* * * The elevation of the fold was so slow that it
did not divert the streams."
Dutton 8 thought that the Colorado drainage was inherited from a system of streams established on Tertiary strata which became folded and faulted at so slow a rate that the position of channels was little disturbed. The streams were antecedent to Tertiary upwarps, and the removal by erosion of Tertiary, Cretaceous, and Jurassic beds brought the drainage system to its present position without changing its pattern. On this interpretation the drainage of the ICaiparowits region might be described as superposed antecedent. Dutton says:
The whole province is a vast category of instances of river chnnnels where they never could have run if the structural features had in any manner influenced them. What, then, determined the present distribution of the drainage'? The answer is that they were determined by the configuration of the old Eocene lake bottom at the time it was drained. Then, surely, the watercourses ran in conformity with the surface of the uppermost Tertiary stratum. Soon afterwards that surface hegan to be deformed by unequal displacement, but the rivers had fastened themselves to their places and refused to be diverted.
Dutton recognized, however,9 that the Waterpocket and .Escalante monoclines are of pre-Tertiary age; their beveled strata are overlain by Eocene sediments. l-Ie explained this " anomaly " by assuming that erosion prevailed in a part of the plateau province while deposition elsewhere was continuous. Gilbert10 tentatively expressed the opinion that the Echo Cliffs flexure determined the course of the Paria River, but later concluded that "there is no ground for the

opinion that the courses of Kanab and Paria Creeks were in part determined by antecedent folds." In a note written still later 11 he said :
The observations that form the IJasis of these reports were hurried in the extreme. The writer, for the most part, accompanied field parties which were specially equipped. for rapidity of moven~ent and were crowded to the utmost. Moreover,_ in a country almost. unmapped. the demand for geographical information '~as more urgent than for geological, and all plans and routes were accordingly, and with propriety, shaped to give the topographer the best opportunities consistent with rapidity of movement, while the geologist gleaned what he could by the way. To study the structure of a region under such circumstances was to read a book while its pages were quickly turned by ::mother, and the result was a larger collection of impressions than of facts. That many of these impressions· should be erroneous was inevitable, and no one .can be more conscious than I of the fallibility of what I have written. Still I am far frcim counting my labor lost; for the best presentations that have been given of westem geology are not free from error, and I certainly have most honorable company in my imperfection.
More than a year has elapsed since the manuscript left my hands, and in that time I have again visited Utah. Partly as the result of my new work, and partly by facts which have been developed by others, I have been induced to change some of my ideas, and I avail myself of this occasion to make a few retractions.
On page 132, basalt is erroneously reported to occur near the town of Salina, Utah.
On page 44, it is stated that an orographic disturbance ocCUlTed in the northwest part of the plateau province "befon' the deposition of the Cretaceous." The unconfo~mity. which I observed I now know to have arisea after the deposition of the Cretaceous.
On page 116, the opinion is expressed that artesian water might be found along the eastern base of the Pahve t .Range. Mr. Powell has since discovered a fault in the strata of th\:! locality which greatly diminishes the probability.
It is asserted on pages 129, 130, and 525 that the San Francisco lava field is continuous with the great lava field of New Mexico. The notes of Dr. Loew show that this is not so.
'!'here is no good ground for the opinions advanced en pages 76 and 81 that the courses of Kanab and Paria Creeks were in part determined by antecedent folds and that the Aubrey Cliff as a topographical feature antedates the Grand Canyon.
The unhappily large number of typographical errors in Part I are due in part to the fact that I was absent in Utah during the proofreading and did not see the pages until they. had been stereotyped. In these few copies that I distribute myself I have corrected many of the errors in the ·margin. I haYe also restored in part some words and sentences that were suppressed in the manuscript after it passed my hands. .Certain of the restored pas~nges are necessary to the understanding of the context, and others are needed to prevent the impression that I disregarded through ignorance or discourtesy the work of other geologists.
It is difficult indeed to imagine the conditions under which the observed relations of deformed Cretaceous beds that unconformably underlie horizontal Tertiary beds can be accommodated to the supposed antecedent origin of the Colorado drainage system. There is no
· 11 Idem, prefatory note in copies of vol. 3 per~onally distributed by Mr. Gilbert.

reason to doubt that Tertiary beds once covered all of the l(aiparowits region and extended far beyond its borders and also that the great upwarps and monoclinal folds are not only pre-Tertiary but were eroded to a surface of low relief before the deposition of the Tertiary beds. The known disturbances of the Tertiary beds consist of faults which postdate Eocene sedimentation and which probably developed after Tertiary and perhaps alsd Cretaceous and, Jurassic beds had been removed from some areas north, south, and east of the Color~do River. The antecedent origin of the Colorado drainage system as described by the geologists of the Powell Survey is therefore highly improbable. It seems more probable that the Colorado and its main tributaries were established ~n a former, very widespread surface of Tertiary rocks. If the drainage was established as a consequent system on this old Tertiary ~mrface the Colorado and its tributaries, on cutting into the older rocks, would. obviously find themselves superposed indifferently on whatever formations and structural features chanced to underlie the Tertiary.
Even though the larger streams in the Kaiparowits region may in part owe their position to superposition of an original consequent system that was developed on Tertiary beds, their present trends and habits are adjustments to one or more surfaces of erosion of much later date. Remnant peneplains and abandoned meanders indicate an erosion surface of very low relief that bordered the main drainage channels and extended to some distance beyond. (See pp. 133-135.) On this erosion surface the Colorado River and its main tributaries could have been retained or established in essentially the position that they now occupy. If irregularities due 1o differences in rock hardness had been obliterated, the drainage lines established would be unadjusted to the underlying rock structure. When subsequently the region was uplifted and the streams began actively to deepen their valleys, the small, weak streams woul_d be guided by struciure, but the large, strong streams might retain their positions across obstacles that chanced to lie in their paths. Such superposition would presumably account for the existing discordance of streams and structure and for the resulting physiographic features. .To use Gilbert's term, the streams are "superimposed by planation."
EXTENT AND RATE OF EROSION
The extreme ruggedness of the Kaiparowits region is due primarily to sculpture by streams. The lofty 1nesas and buttes have been carved out of extensive high-level plateaus, not lifted by locally active forces. The relief is a record of downward departures rather than upward departures from a former general surface. The ·amount of material removed by strean1 ·

carving, however, is enormous; thousands of feet of rock have been stripped from a region tens of thousands of square miles in area. But the parts remaining are even greater than the parts removed ; the amount of denudation yet to be accomplished in the present cycle far exceeds that already completed.
The present local base-level of erosion for streams in the Kaiparowits region lies at the head of Marble Gorge, where hard limestone greatly retards the downcutting of the Colorado River. Because of this barrier the river in Glen Canyon is no longer actively deepening its bed and seems unable to remove the rock waste that it has accumulated along its margins. The ]_Jrofile of the Colorado River through Glen Canyon und Marble Gorge is but a large-scale illustration of the adjustment to rock hardness that is shown by most' streams of the Kaiparowits region.
As an aid in producing land waste, the Colorado River in its course between Hite and Lees Ferry exerts small influence, and until its load of waste is significantly lessened or Marble Gorge is deepened, it is likely to remain in that position. But the tributaries of Glen Canyon are not thus handicapped. Their gradients are steep, many of them precipitous; the floods that occur many times ea{!h year give them special strength. At present they are not only carrying the enormous amount of waste brqught to them· by smaller streams, but in many places they are deepening their channels and removing materials that were deposited during a former period of aggradation. Denudation in the Kaiparowits region is.probably proceeding as rapidly as in any other part of the plateau province. and more rapidly than in most humid regions. If the present favorable climatic conditions continue these relative rates seem likely· to prevail throughout the present cycle of erosion.
EROSION SURFACES
REGIONAL DISTRIBUTION
On the Uinkaret, Shivwits, Kaibab, and Coconino Plateaus Dutton discovered remnants of old gently graded erosion surfaces which bevel across Permian beds-hard rocks and soft rocks alike-and which have been preserved by a protecting cap of basalt. This evidence of ancient cycles led to the significant generalization that before the beginning of the cutting of the present Grand Canyon and the other deep canyons of the region the plateau district was reduced essentially to a base-level of erosion and that the present cycle of active canyon sculpture was ·initiated by f1 pronounced uplift that strongly rejuvenated the streams. Dutton 12 says:
u Dutton, C. E., Tertiary history of the Gmnd Canyon district: U. S. Gcol. Sut·vcy Mon. 2, pp. 223-224, 1882.

At the epoch when the cutting of the present Grand Canyon began, no doubt the district at large presented a very different aspect from the modern one. The fact that the older basalts, wherever found, rest upon the same geological horizon, viz, the summit of the Permian, suggests to us the further inference that the region near the river was then fiat and destitute of deep canyons and valle~·s, such as now exist there, and therefore destitute of great hills, buttes, or mesas. The meaning of this is a base-level of erosion. The rivers could not corrade, because they had reached, for the time being, their limiting depth in the strata. The work of erosion would then be confined to leveling the sculptural inequalities without the power to produce new ones or to augment the·relief of old ones.
In addition to the peneplain remnants in the pJateau province described by Dutton, others have been. mapped by Huntington and Goldthwait,13 Robinson,14 and Gregory 15 and incidentally mentioned by others. Some of these erosion surfaces have been developed in Permian beds, others in Triassic beds, and the Hopi Buttes peneplain bevels successively Cretaceous, Jurassic, and Triassic beds. Although they stand at different altitudes between 4,000 and 7,000 feet, some of these fragmentary surfaces are probably comparable in age and history. In the Kaiparowits region old-age erosion surfaces appear at several places-conspicuous features in an are.a of vigorous youthful erosion.
CANNONVILLE EROSION SURFACE
In the upper Paria Valley the little Mormon .town of Cannonville is surrounded by extensive remnants of an old erosion surface that planes smoothly across hard and soft Upper Jurassic and Cretaceous beds. In most places this erosion surface has a rather pronounced angle to the bedding of the stratified rocks. East of Henrieville and :Q.ortheast of Tropic there are broad, -little-dissected remnants developed on the soft Tropic s~ale. (See pl. 25, B.) A mantle of coarse, well-rounded water-borne materials protects the underlying weak rocks and has aided materially in preserving portions of the graded plain. Near Cannonville the erosion .surface intersect~ the basal part of the soft shale and the hard sandstone at the bottom of the Cretaceous. To the west, overlooked by the high cliffs of the Paunsaugunt, the divides between the streams that are cutting actively headward into the High Plateaus are even-topped and very gently. inclined toward the Paria.
In many places a lower surface is marked by a prominent bench that is subparallel to the upper erosion surface and about 200 feet lower. It is well developed in the Cretaceous shale area east of Tropic.

·No definite evidence of the geologic nge of the stages in the physiographic history of the plateau region is at hand. Dutton assigned the great erosion of this region to the Miocene and Pliocene. He believed that the outer gorge of the Grand Canyon was carved in Pliocene time and the inner gorge in Quaternary time. These condusions, based on assumed climatic conditio.ns during the Tertiary period, have not been substantiated. Robinson 21 places the peneplain cycle in the Pliocene n,nd the erosion of the Grand Canyon in t~1e Quaternary, basing these assignments <;>n correl::ttion with little-known strata and topographic forms in the country west of the Grand Canyon.
An outline of the probable main stages in the physiographic evolution of the southern Utah plateau region is as follows :

1. A period of widespread folding associated with regionnl

upllf:t: of the Cretaceous dates from the Cretaceous-Tertiary

interval. 'l'he main structural features formed at this time

are the 'Vaterpocket monocline, the Circle Cliffs upwarp, the

FJscalnnte monocline, the Kaiparowits downwarp, the Echo

monocline, the Enst Knibab monocline, and the Kaibab upwarp.

2. A period of extensive erosion in earliest Tertiary time;

during which the domes and ridges of Cretaceous rocks were

reduced to a gentle surface.

~· A period of differential warping, which was probably

associn ted with regional depression. On the long slopes and

floors of the basins thus formed Eocene beds ("Wasatch for-

mation) of continental origin were laid c;town. Volcanism was

nctlve.

4. Post-Eocene uplift, accompanied or followed by ext(msh:e

fuulting.

5. A period of extensive and long-continued erosion, during

which much of the 'l'ertinry beds were removed, the present

plntcnn blocks were outlined, and erosion surfaces of low

relief were developed along the Colorado, the Paria, and

other streams.

·

6. A regional uplift that revived the streams of the region

nnd provided fnvorable conditions for cutting the canyons of

the Colorndo River and the many smaller streams.

The recent geologic history of the Kaiparowits reg:ion includes a period of aggradation, during which the bottoms of the rock canyons were filled with alluvium, and a period of degradation that was marked by the trenching of gravel floors ·of canyons and of rtlluvial slopes on plateaus.

THE KAIPAROWITS REGION

eastward from Paria and flows in a short, narrow, vertical-sided canyon through the upturned Jurassic sandstone in the East Kaibab 1nonocline, whi'ch at this point trends north. (See pl. 26, B.) Below this canyon the river maintains its course obliquely across a belt of weak rocks and passes into a valley that is incJosed in places by flat-lying Cretaceous sandstone and open where Cretaceous shale and soft Upper Jurassic strata crop out. (See pl. 27, A.) Here the river is joined by Cottonwood Creek, which heads in the broad-floored Butler VaHey but in the lower 15 miles of its course flows as a subsequent stream along the East J(aibab n1onocline. A short tributary that i~: developed in this same weak zone joins the Paria from the south.
A short distance below the abandoned settlement of Adairville the river again enters the Na-vajo sandstone and in a narrow, winding, gradually deepening canyon cuts through the Paria Plateau. The last few 1niles of its valley in Arizona are carved in the underlying. weak Chinle and Moenkopi beds.
The topographic features of the Paria Valley indicate that its course was established originally on .a land surface unlike that of to-day. The region now occupied by the headwaters of the Paria wa~ once part of the High Plateaus and was drained by northwardflowing streams that were unrelated to ·the Colorado system. The walls of the Paunsaugunt and Table Cliff Plateaus mark the present limit of a northwardsloping highland that once extended farther so.uth. If any part of the surface now represented by the maturely developed top of the Paunsaugunt Plateau formerly sloped southward, the consequent drainage could have been related to the Paria. Likewise, if the surface of the upraised block east of the Paunsaugunt fault had originally a southward inclination the conditions· would favor southward-flowing consequent ·streams in the general position of fhe Paria. But. both regional structure and drainage patterns s·uggest that the inclination of the plateau blocks has remained essentially the same during the life of the present drainage.
In their courses through the East Kaibab monocline
the Paria and its main tributaries-Hackberry,. Sand
'Vash, and Kaibab Gulch Creeks-are superposed on
the structure. Sand Wash and Kaibab Gulch in par-
ticular seem strangely out of accord with the attittide
and hardness of the rocks. The topography suggests that the waters of these streams, as they come down the slopes of the J(aibab Plateau, should be gathered in the House Rock Valley and' conducted along this almost continuous depression to the Colorado River. Instead these streams cross the longitudinal valley and head straight for massive sandstone walls, which they penetrate in narrow, deep canyons.

The drainage pattern of the Paria Valley seems impossible of explanation on the assumption that theParia is an obsequent stream, the headward elongation. of a one-time unimportant tributary of the Colorado.. This interpretation becomes reasonable, however,. when the Paria drainage is assumed to· have originated on son1e higher surface frorri which monoclinal. flexurelS were absent.

Near the town of Escalante the rivercrosses this depression, which seems to offer an easy· passage to the southeast, and farther eastward it. plunges into the steep-sided Escalante monocline. Beyond the monocline a narrow·, winding canyon, cut. mostly in Navajo sandstone, leads to the Colorado.
As in the Paria Valley, the upper tributaries of the· Escalante have established their position by headward. erosion, reducing th~ area of the Table Cliff, Paunsaugunt, and Aquarius Plateaus and diverting the west-ward-flowing tributaries of the Sevier River. ·In the "Upper Valley" and at Escalante the stream is obviously superposed· on monoclines.

quent as erosion revealed weak beds in suitable relations to resistant beds and that continued ·erosion revealed structure to which adjusbnent was made by superimposition. The Escalante might thus be termed a superposed subsequent stream.
The lower part of the Escalante Canyon has a rem:u:lmbly intricate meandering course. From its mouth a traverse of 35 miles along the river bed measure~ 14 miles in a straight line. The inclosing sandstone walls exhibit typical features of "ingrown" meanders, with prominent slip-off slopes on the spurs and steeply undercut cliffs on the outer and downst.reu m sides of the 1neander bends. Part of the meandering 1nay have been inherited from an earlier eycle of erosion, but most of it has been developed during the present cycle.
MINOR PHYSIOGRAPHIC FEATURES
ALLUVIAL TERRACES
V\Ti th unimportant exceptions all streams in the 1\.u.iparowits region are vigorously eroding their beds. l"'hose flowing on rock are scouring their floors, and those flowing on sand and gravel are rapidly cutting downward and sideward. Not only has aggradation ceased, but enormous quantities of valley fill are torn up and carried each season to the Colorado. In some valleys no alluvimn is left; a rock-walled, rock-bottomed canyon has replaced a canyon that was deeply floored with alluvial sand and clay. The typical stream is one that flows between alluvial terraces ineluded in a canyon whose walls are of rock. That this deep trenching of valley fill is characteristic of streams throughout Arizona, New Mexico, southern Utn.h, and southern Colorado is shown by the records compiled by Bryan.24 The streams of southern Nevada and southern California likewise are developing arroyos. Field evidence supplemented by detailed historical accounts proves that the present habit of streams in southern Utah has been established within the last 50 years. The conditions that existed 1n 1878-1880 are described by Dutton 25 as follows:
Most of those lateral canyons • • • are slowly filling up with alluvium at the present ti:~ne, but very plainly they were much deeper at no remote epoch in the past. The lower tnlus in some of them is completely buried, and the alluvium mounts up on the breasts of perpendicular scarps. In some cnses a smooth floor of alluvium extends from side to side of what was originally a canyon valley.· The recurrence of a climate sufficiently moist to sustain a vigorous perennial stream would probably sweep out all this unconsolidated alluvium and return the valley to its former condition of an ordinary canyon.
21 Brynn, Kirk, Dntc of chrmnel trenching (arroyo cutting) in the nl'ld Southwest: Science, new ser., vol. 62, pp. 338-344, 1925.
~n Dutton, C. lD., 'ret·tinry history of the Gmnd Canyon. district U. S. Gcol. SUL·vey Mon. 2, pp. 228-229,' 1882.

The present conditions are 1n strong contrast to those pictured by Dutton. The meadows along streams have been destroyed, valley flats are deeply trenched, and the sod-bound soil, which once extended widely, even over such !"egions as the W aterpocket Fold, parts of the Escalante Basin, and valleys tributary to the Paria, is now represented by inconspicuous patches. On the streams in the Kaiparowits region excessive degradation began during the decade 1880-1890. (See p. 30.)
As elsewhere suggested 26 the great change in the valley topography of the plateau province may reasonably be ascribed to climate n.ssisted by ·human agencies. Unfortunately the rainfall, snowfall, and temperature of southeastern Utah were not measured prior to 1890, bdt the meager rainfall records from outlying stations show that the years 1884-1889 were relatively wet. During this period the precipitation at Los Angeles an¢l San Bernardino, Calif., and Fort Mojave, Ariz., was, respectively, 49, 42, and 100 per cent above normal. For these stations the heaviest rainfall ever recorded fell in 1884. Fort Wingate, N. Mex., received only a little more than its average rain during the period 1884-1889, but during the seven years 1867-1873 this station recorded 40 per cent more than· the usual rain-a fact that may be causally related to the earlier beginning of terracing in the Puerco and Chaco Valleys.27 The evidence from rainfall 1neasurements is suggestive rather than conclusive. Some dry years are included in the records for 1884-1889, but the years preceding and following that period are neither consistently dry nor consistently wet. In the plateau province, however, variations in mean annual rainfall have relatively little significance. As beat:ing on erosion, the seasonal and daily distribution of rainfall, the nature of the showers and the area they cover, and· the relation of rainfall to snowfall and to t~mperature are features of much more importance.
Erosion results from sudden violent showers, and if suitably distributed in time an annual rainfall of half the normal amount ma.y be more effective in denudation than twice the normal. The specta~ular erosion which in 1884-85 sunk the alluvial floor of l(anab Creek 60 feet and widened it 70 feet for a distance of 15 n1iles began in response to the melting of exceptionally deep accumulations of snow.
On the plateau tops and steep slopes and on canyon fioors alike the balance between aggradation and degradation is in remarlqtbly close adjustinent. Only slight changes in amount and kind of rain, in stream gradient, and in cover of vegetation are sufficient to

THE KAIPAROWITS REGION

change stream habit. The construction of a dam or an irrigation ditch, the killing off of beavers, the building of roads, and the plowing of fields ~ay beO'in far- reaching changes. The effect of grazing, escpecially overgrazing, on run-off and stream trench1' ng i~ obvious. The net result of the interference by man with the delicately adjusted streams is an increase in amount of surface water and the number of intermittent springs accompanied by a destruction· of forage and of arable land. (See p. 31.)
The smallercanyons of the Kaiparowits region were sunk deep into their rock floors and then filled with sediment 40 to 150 feet deep. Recently removal of the sediments began. The canyon cutting probably dates from the uplift that placed the Colorado in position to excavate Glen Canyon. The aggradation may have been contemporaneous with the formation of local peneplains in the Little Colorado Valley and elsewhere whose position and altitude are difficult to explain.· Canyon cutting, canyon filling, and removal of fill constitute a series of stages that may have been duplicated several times; the bases of some canyon walls show the effects of erosion at different rates, and within the alluvial deposits are many erosional unconformities.. The evidence shows several changes in the conditions o{ erosion and sedimentation, but neither the number nor the duration of the epicycles involved has been determined.
CANYON WALLS
In the Kaiparowits region, as elsewhere in the ·plateau province, canyons cut in massive thick sandstone are box headed. In most such canyons the walls are as steep and ·as high at their heads as along their sides; some of them overhang. The canyon walls are fluted by rincons and by less symmetrical recesses, many of which extend from the floor of the canyon to its rim. Perched high on the walls are caves and rock shelters. ·Some of them are mere toe holds ; others are flat-floored caverns that extend· tens of feet into the vertical sandstone walls and are protected by arched roofs-sites chosen by the cliff dweller. (See pl. 27, 0.) ·As interpreted by Gregory,28 stream erosion has played little part in the production of these features; they are the result of disintegration that was aided by ground water and guided by texture and structure of rocks. In some places two niches that were developed opposite each other in narrow rock walls have become united, producing a "hole in. the
r~ck " that resembles the windows made in the for-
mation of natural bridges. Niches and wall pockets of different sizes are characteristic of the Navajo and Entrada sandstones and appear also in walls of Morrison and Upper Cretaceous sandstones.

BUTTES AND TOWERS

Under the attack of stream erosion, aided by

weathering and guided by planes of structural weak-

. ness,. the great plateaus are cut into mesas, and por-

tions of the mesa walls become detached. Further

weathering and disintegration reduces the size a~d

modifies the form of these remnants, producing monu-

ments, towers, chimneys, and spires that add much to

scenic interest. Lone Rock, in Wahweap Valley,

and are therefore much less conspicuous than similar

erosion features in the Navajo country. Tall rough-

sided earth columns cut from materials of landslides

are common. (See pl. 28, A-D.)

ARCHES AND BRIDGES
On the walls of many canyons cross-bedding outlines arches. Some of these arches appear as if drawn with crayon on the smooth rock face; others unite the tops of pilasters and form the borders of blind windows; still others form the roofs of niches and rock shelters. In fact, curved surfaces, in both horizontal and vertical positions, are characteristic of detailed seulpture on walls of Navajo and Entrada sandstones. As alcoves are recessed deeper and deeper into canyon walls there is a tendency for surface water to make its way through the arched roof along vertical joint planes, a process which if continued under favorable conditions results in a crack open to the sky. Enlargement of this long, narrow skylight permits the outer part of the alcove roof to stand alone as an arch separated from the canyon wall by the width of . the opening. Further erosion gives the arch the form of a hoop rising above the general rock surface Or detaches it completely from the wall, making a bridge which spans the original alcove. Arches having this . history were noted near the head of Cottonwood Creek, at the " narrows " on Halls Creek, and on tributaries to the Paria. The largest one observed is in Escalante Canyon above the mouth of Sand Creek. This Escalante arch, which stands about 30 feet out from the wall of Navajo sandstone, has a span of about 130 feet, a height of 70 feet above the floor of an ancient alcove,. and a thickness of 13 feet. The roadway on top is 12 feet wide. (See pl. 27, D.)
On Fortymile Creek a beautiful natural bridge has resulted from the undercutting of a m-eander spur and has reproduced the history of the well-known Rainbow Bridge in the Navajo country. As estimated by
vV. R. Chenoweth, of the· United States Geological
Survey, the Fortymile Bridge has a span· of 200 feet

WATER POCKETS
Many bare rock surfaces in the Kaiparowits region a.re clotted with pits and saucerlike depressions that fill with water after rains. These features are common on the broad sandstone platforms that border Glen Canyon and on the floor of the Escalante Basin. Their abundance on the crests and flanks of the Waterpocket monocline account for the name of this flexure. They appear here and there on rocks of all kinds but ure characteristic of the Navajo sandstone, which possesses to an unusual degree the texture and structure favorable for their development. In ground plan they range from irregular rings or curved-sided depressions a few inches across to irregularly bordered lake basins more than 100 feet across; in depth they range from a fraction of an inch to as much as 6 feet. The commonest ones are 1 to 3 inches deep and 2· t0 5 feet in longest diameter. S01ne of them hold mere fihns of water, to~ thin to pern1it a horse to drink and disappearing within a few hours after a rain; others nre deep, pennanent wells that hold several barrels of · water and constitute the chief supply for pack trains when the near-by gravel-floored washes are dry. These water pockets seem at first sight to be. distributed in a haphazn.rd fashion without reference to slopes or joints or differences in rock texture. but examination of the rock surface shows them to be located on inclined surfaces at places where joints or crossbedding laminae intersect, where the rock cement is weak, or where lens.es of coarse-grained rock join finergrained rock. The position of soJ,Tie rock basins on the crest of the Waterpocket Fold is determined by sand dikes-the hardened filling of cracks.
The deepest pockets forn1 rows at the bottom of poorly defined valleys. Many pockets have lips over w4ich water esca.pes. During light rains the pockets a.re filled or partly filled by run-off in their immediate vicinity. During heavy thundershowers the water from surrounding slopes passes through these pockets as a strea1n or as a sheet flood that covers the entire surface. The running water merely makes little ripples when crossing the shn.llowest pockets, but it swirls in and out of the deep ones. When examined after the water l1as ceased to run, the pockets are seen to have los~ the sand, hardened silt, and vegetable debris that previous~y had coated their bottoms ; their floors are bare 1;ock or clean sand. The basins have been scoured out and doubtless somewhat enlarged, although some have been made more

shallow by the grinding down of their rims. During long periods between rains many shallow pockets are· filled or partly filled by wind-blown dust, which forms mud in basins containing water and a fluffy coating on the floor of dry basins. One windstorm 'vas observed to fill several basins to their rims with sand and to deposit some sand in others. Doubtless in favorable place~ wind Temoves dry materials from shallow basins and scours their floors with sand, but it seems not to be a very effective excavating agent. It is significant that leaves· and twigs remain in dry water pockets during heavy. windstorms and that many depressions exposed to the wind but beyond the reach of running water contain shrubs ·and grass growing in patches of soil.
WORK OF THE WIND .
In the l(aiparowits region the winds are neither strong· nor persistent; the topography is unfavorable for large-scale wind erosion or deposition. (See p. 12.) Low dune ri<;lges appear here and there and on the Glen Canyon platform, and in the Escalante Valley are dune areas of a few acres, but most of the dust carried by the wind is piled at the corners of rock .buttresses, dumped over canyon walls, or moved back and forth along dry washes awaiting its time of transport to the Colorado .River.
Although bare flat rock forms much of the surface, and innumerable buttes and mesa walls lie across the path of prevailing winds, no abraded surfaces or wind et.ched rocks were observed·. The shallow water pockets described by Bryan 29 as features of wind erosion are believed in the main to be the work of weather and running water.
LANDSLIDES
The efficiency of ground water as a factor in erosion is shown by the landslides in the Tropic shale and to a less extent in the Chinle. When the Chinle " marls " and shales on steep slopes are saturated they seem to move by their own weight, carrying their broken strata and talus blocks to lower levels. At the south base of the Paria Plateau slides in the Chinle have spilled over the Shinarump conglomerate and down the Moenkopi· cliffs to the Kaibab below, and at a place about 14 miles !:?Outh of the Burr trail the Chinle beds have lost their hold and have slid, accompanied by huge fragments, over the upturned beds of Navajo sandstone, down the west side of the Halls Creek Valley in a jumbled mass that is roughly threefourths of a mile wide, llj2 miles long, and 80 feet deep. The slopes of Tropic shale along the so~thwest

flank of the Kaiparowits Plateau are in many places streaked with landslides; in places they are completely masked. The high-lying Tropic on the northeast face of the Kaiparowits Plateau between Coyote Hole and Willow Tanks is the seat of landslides which one after. another have flowed· down the shale slopes and out over the Dakota (~)-capped benche~, carrying with them great talus blocks and slabs of Straight Cliffs sandstone.
As viewed from the rim of the Kaiparowits Plateau at Fiftymile Point the landslides are impressive. The slopes below the capping Cretacequs sandstone

constitute a field about 2 miles wide and 10 miles long, everywhere strewn with boulders, the largest of which are square blocks of sandstone 40 feet thick. Successive slides have banked the materials in huge ridges like a series of terminal and lateral moraines.
Except in areas of Chinle and Tropic shales landslides were not observed. The steep slopes of other formations are bare or coated with only ribbons and ~cattered patches of debris. Surface water, ground water, and rock structure do not occur in combinations favorable for the. production of talus; disintegrated rock is removed about as fast as it is formed.

CHAPTER 5. ECONOMIC GEOLOGY

The rocks of the Kaiparowits region are mineralized only to a slight extent. There are no metamorphic rocks, no pegmatites, and no igneous intrusions. Jn fact, except for the Tertiary basalts that cap the Table Cliff and Aquarius Plateaus, igneous r<_:>cks are lacking. Some of the sandstones and shales contain bits of gold, small amounts of ~ow-grade copper ore appear in a few places, and carnotite has been reported.
Sandstone for building is abundant, and at a few places adobe and clay are available for briclrmaking. Gypsum is widely distributed, but limestone suitable for cement is rare. Some of the Triassic strata are oil bearing, and oil seeps from sandstone at the southeast end of the Waterpocket Fold,' but a well sunk at the Circle Cliffs gave unsatisfactory results.
In addition to water the one deposit of economic value is coal, which occurs at several horizons on the flanks of the I\:aiparowits Plateau.
GOLD
Within the Kaiparowits region, as elsewhere in the plateau province, the Triassic and Jurassic rocks indude widely distributed minute flakes of gold, and accumulations in gravel bars along the principal .streams are sufficient to attract attention.
There are reports of prospectors along the Waterpocket Fold, in the Henry Mountains, and east of tbe Colorado River about Elk Ridge and the Abajo Mountains as early as 1870, and the finding of gold in sandstone and gravel of the San Juan River in the fall of 1892 led to the " Bluff excitement " of 1892-93.1 Little prospecting seems to have been done along the Colorado River until the practicability of its traverse had been demonstrated by Powell. The wide desert stretches along the river, the difficulty of finding or making a feasible trail from the canyon rim to the .stream below, and the ignorance of probable cataracts .and whirlpools stood as discouragements. But the .discovery in 1880 of the Dandy crossing (Hite) and
in-of feasible routes leading to it resul~~d the loca-
tion of a working camp, to which supplies could be brought from settlements in both Utah and Colorado. 'The establishment of a miners' trading station at Hanksville in 1884 made conditions still more· favor-

able. By using the Dandy crossing as a base the bars

and alluvial gravel along the Colorado River between

the mouth of the Fremont and Lees Ferry have been

intermittently worked since 1883.

The following notes regarding placer mining in

Glen Canyon were compiled from conversation and

personal letters of Mr. Bert Loper, whose knowledge

of the Colorado River between Hite and Lees Ferry is

based on many years of experience.

Gold was discovered near the mouth of Trachyte

Canyon by Cass Hite in 1883. Most of the mining in

Glen Canyon was done during the years 1886-1889.

A few men were at work during the following decade,

and at least one man continued to pan gold until 1908.

Doubtless in later years prospectors have worked here

and there for short periods.

Beginning at the mouth of Crescent Wash, the

larger bars explored for gold are North Wash, Ifite,

Grub Stake, Cape Horn, Monte Cristo, Red Canyon,

Tickaboo, Good Hope, Sevenmile, Olympia, Califor-

nia, Moki, New Year, Burro, Boston, Anderson,

Shock, Butler, Klondyke, Meskin, and Wright, the

last of which is near the mouth of Navajo Creek.

~"rom all these bars enough gold to meet day wages was

obtained. A good amount of gold was reco':ered at

Boston, Red Canyon, Klondyke, Moki, Olympia, and

GQod Hope bars, and the California b.ar yielded more

than $10,000. All the bars were located as prospects,

except Good Hope, which is the only patented land

within Glen Canyon.

posited at hig4-water stages of the river, but tests

within the gravel, and at the contact of the gravel and

bedrock. From bedrock itself the yields were insig-

nificant. Assays made for A. P·. Adams of " red

marl," "blue marl," "blow sand," and river silt

showed from 20 cents to $1.20 a ton.

Frank Bennett, who has long been familiar with the

placer deposits of Glen Canyon, says that selected

gravel from the Gold Coin claim yielded about 72 cents a cubic yard and that a bar near the mouth of Red Creek yielded from 70 cents to more than $1 a yard.2
Nearly all the mining was done with rotkers, but where conditions were favorable home-made sluice boxes and quicksilver riflles were installed. Some shafts were sunk, and the tunnels in gravel banks a hundred feet or more above high-water level on the Loper claim near Tickaboo represent much..hard work with pick and shovel. Lack of water fron1 sources above the gold-bearing gravel and the expense of pumping from the river below have prevented large hydraulic operations. A water wheel was tried at Good Hope Bar, and in 1900 a power dredge was installed and operated for a few weeks near the mouth of Bullfrog (Hanson; Pine Alcove) Creek, but the flour gold recovered was insufficient to pay the cost of installation.. (See pl. 29, A.)
During the years 1910-1913 an ·ambitious scheme was developed for recovering gold from sandstone, shale, and silt on the Paria River at Lees Ferry and Paria. After preliminary study, including many assays, several hundred claims were located, assessment work was begun, and steam dredges and power shovels . that were ·freighted from Marysvale were installed at the mouth of the Paria. To obtain fuel for operating
athe dredges coal mine was opened in Warm Creek
about 10 miles from its mouth, and a wagon road was constructed. Fron1 the end of the road a .pack-horse trail was built through the narrow canyon portion of the Warm Creek Valley to the Colorado River, and a barge was constructed for carrying the coal to its destination. (See pl. 29, B.) The plan was to re-
allcover the gold known to exist in nearly the beds
of the Chinle formation, which is well exposed at the mouth of Glen Canyon and underlies thousands of square miles in Arizona and Utah with a thickness exceeding 500 feet.
Assays ·of 14 samples from Lees Ferry, received through the courtesy of Mr. C. H. Spencer, show an average of about 25 cents a ton for the " silts " derived from the Chinle beds. Analyses of three series of samples taken by Lawson 3 from equivalent beds at Paria showed an average of less than 5 cents of gold in a ton of shale and sandstone. The largest amount, 10 cents a ton, came from a bed of sandstone. Similar figures were obtained for the gold content of the Moenkopi formation immediately below the Shinarump conglomerate. Gold appears to be fairly evenly disseminated in the Chinle .shales, and· their composition and texture make them favorable for

hydraulic mining. The metal occurs, however, as excessively fine flakes and dust and requires much skill for its recovery. Because of this difficulty and theisolation of the mining field, with the consequent enormous cost of operation, work at Lees Ferry was discontinued in 1913. A few years later an unsuccess-· ful attempt was made to revive gold mining at Paria. · village in connection with an ill-starred irrigation. project.. (Seep. 31.)
The gold of Glen Canyon is accompanied by black sands, consisting of magnetite, hematite, ilmenite,. garnet, and small amounts of chromite, zircon, and· rutile. One analysis showed 0.15 ounce of platinum to the ton.4 Obviously these minerals have originally come from mineralized rocks that were different from those now exposed in the Kaiparowits region. Some· of the placer gold probably has been carried to Glen Canyon by streams from the Henry, La Sal, and. Abajo Mountains, where gold-bearing veins are known, but it seems reasonable to assume that most. of it has come from the disintegration of near-by· Triassic sediments.
COPPER
Prospecting for copper in the Moenkopi, Chinle,. and Navajo formation'S has been carried on at a number of plac.es in the Paria Valley, and some low-gradecopper ore is said to have been shipped from theHattie Green ~ine, 2 miles west of· Adairville. Small lenses of impure green and blue mineralized material,. including azurite and malachite, have been noted at. several places in red beds assigned to the Glen Canyon. and San Rafael groups. Copper appears also at pros-pect holes in the Tertiary beds of the Aquarius Plateau. No· deposits of commercial value have been. found.
·coAL
DISTRIBUTION
A study of the Cretaceous rocks in the KaiparowitS;
nPlateau and the upper Paria Valley indicates that
beds of coal are restricted to the Dakota ( sand-· stone, Tropic shale, and Straight Cliffs sandstone. Most of the emil deposits in the Dakota ( ~) and Tropicformations are so thin and so poor in quality that they have little commercial value, but some of thecoal beds in the Straight Cliffs sandstone are thick and of good grade. (See pl. 30.) In the Dakota ( ~) sandstone coal appears in almost all places where this. formation is exposed. In the Tropic. shale coal is. generally absent, but in the upper Pa.ria Valley the· lower 100 to 200 feet of this formation contains thin. beds of coal. ·

COAL

149

In the Straight Cliffs sandstone the main expo~ures of coal are in two districts-one on vVarm and Last Chance Creeks in east central l(~ne County and the other in canyons southwest, of Escalante in Garfield County. ·Thinner and less extensive coal beds in the upper Paria Valley ft:u·nisli coal for local use at Tropic, Cannonville, and I-Ienrieville. In some places the Straight Cliffs sandstone appears to lack coal beds. Indeed, the known coal deposits of commercial value arc distributed over an area of only four or five townships in the south-central and northern parts of the Kaiparowits Plateau. It is probable, however, that the coal-bearing beds of vVarm Creek and Last Cha.nce Creek a.re connected under a cover of younger beds with those at Escalante, so as to form a coalbmu·ing area 10 to 15 1niles in width and 35 to 40 miles in length. Evidently coal was formerly much more abundant, for in most of the south-central part of the l(niparowits Plateau, particularly between 'Varm and Lust Chance Creeks, the coal-bearing beds in the Straight Cliffs sandstone have been much affected by burning; the shale which commonly underlies and overlies the coal is baked hard, altered in color, and much of it burned to clinker.
COAL IN THE DAKOTA(?) SANDSTONE AND TROPIC SHALE
Eastward from the point southwest of Cannonville in T'. 38 S., H.. 4 vV., where the Dakota ( ~) is cut o~ by the Paunsa.ugunt fault, beds of coal and carbona~ ceous shale appear in the sandstone and sandy shale that cap the escarpments overlooking exposures of variegated· Jurassic rocks to the south. As shown by marine fossils, most of these coal beds belong in the basal portion of the Tropic shale, and the Dakota ( ~) is very thin and consists in places entirely of conglomeratic sandstone. A measured section of the lower part of the Tropic shale in sec. 12, T. 38 S., R. 4 '\V., includes three beds of coal-a bed 7 feet thick, including sevei·al thin partings of bone and sand, another 1 foot 4 inches thick 5 inches below this thick bed, and a third 2 feet thick about 88 feet above it. On Sheep Creek in sec. 35, T. 37 S., R. 4 W., corresponding beds consist .mostly of bone and very thin coni beds but include one bed of coal 2 feet thick.
This coal zone is continuously and rather promiIlently exposed in an extremely irregulal' line that follows the indentations of canyon valleys and the projections of intervening divides. In the vicinity of Cannonville and Henrieville the Dakota ( ~) and coal~ bearing Tropic cap ·the bluffs that nearly surround ench village. There is considerable variation in the coal beds, but sections show several beds 2 feet or less iu thickness. On the south side of Little Creek in sec. 25, T. 37 S., R. 2 W., coal has been mined from a bed 2 feet 10 inches thick in the Dakota. ( ~) sandstone.

The coal is fair· in quality, but it pinches out in a fe'.'.' hundred feet.
Southeast of Henrieville the coal zone swings around the north side of Butler Valley to the East Kaibab monocline, where the sandstone forms a low but persistent hogback for many miles southward in · the Cottonwood Valley. Coal is well exposed on the Paria River southeast of the point where it crosses ·the monocline, and locally it is of workable thickness. A section measured in sec. 20, T. 42 S., R. 1 vV., shows 36 inches of good coal and 8 inches of very in1pure, ·1:yritiferous coal at the top. A short distance away this coal is thinner and much poorer; in sec. 21 of this township there is 5 feet of bone and coal, but no good· bed more than a foot in thickness.
In the Dakota(~) outcrop, which may be followed from the Paria River eastward in an irregular line to the extremity of the l(aiparowits Plateau opposite Navajo Mountain, most measured sections show ·sevcraJ coal beds. Few of then1 are more than 1 foot thick, but one bed in sec. 4, T. 41 S., R. 6 E., is 2 feet 3 jnches thick. At the he·ad of Rock Creek a very prominent dark band more than 6 feet thick at the Dakota ( ~) horizon consists entirely of bone and very . black carbonaceous shale. The Dakota(~) is less persistently coal bearing. on the northeast side of the Kaiparowits Plateau than in the territory farther south and west. Several sections measured southeast of Escalante show no Dakota ( ~) coal.
nAccording to analyses of a sample of typical Dako-
ta.( coal of apparently good grade collected in sec. 4, T. 41 S., R. 6 E., the ash is 19.6 per cent and sulphur 2.1 r>er cent, which is relatively high, and the fixed carbon is 37 per cent, which is low. The heating value of this coal is only 7,280 Britishothermal units, which js very much less than that of good-grade coals from the Straight Cliffs sandstone.
COAL IN THE STRAIGHT CLIFFS SANDSTONE
Although the coal beds of the Straight Cliffs sandstone are much greater in prospective commercial value, they are in general much less prominent than those of the Dakota ( ~), because of the small area of the thick coal deposits and partly because of extensive burning and poor exposures. Determination of the number and extent of the different beds is seriously hampered by the impossibility in most places of tracing the coals along the outcrop. Because the coal has been destroyed by burning to within a few feet of the bottoms of the canyons, it is impossible to trace the coal beds found on the North Branch of 'Varm Creek to the Middle Branch, even where these str{!ams are les·s than a mile apart. The same is true of other parts of the ·Warm Creek drainage basin and the country along Last Chance Creek and its tributaries.

150

THE KAIPAROWITS REGION

As the bottoms of the canyons in the Straight Cliffs formation are in most places covered by stream deposits and talus, the unburned portion ot a coal bed may be buried under rock waste. In several places the only observed exposure of coal was in the very bed of a creek. The fact that somewhat fortuitous shifting of stream cutting and deposition may reveal- or

identified, and its lithologic character changes rapidly in a horizontal plane. In addition, the burning has made unrecognizable beds or zones that might otherwise be traceable and has caused slumping, which disturbs the beds and more or less conceals them.

·In the southwestern and southeastern parts of the .1\::aiparowits Phtteau, where no workable coal be~s

were observed there are indications that the condi-

tions at the ti.;ne of deposition of the Straight Cliffs

formation were unfavorable for the making of coal.

On the upper part of Croton Branch of Last Chance

Creek and farther east, where the Straight Cliffs

sandstone is excellently exposed, marine fossils were found at several horizons, indi~ating that this region

was more or less constantly under water. Along Wahweap Creek and the Paria River, where the entire

thickness of the Straight Cliffs sa{\dstone is exposed in bare rock cliffs and where coal is almost absent

and no ·fossils were seen, the sandstone possibly repre-

sents a fresh-water landward facies that is separated

In physical features the coal of the Straight Cliffs

formation differs more or less in different beds and

18040-31-.11

in different parts of the regwn. In general it is distinctly bedded and has a fairly bright luster. Some of it is very hard and has a subconchoidal fracture and a brilliant luster. Some beds show a fine banding of alternate bright and dull layers, but other beds are massive and either bright or dull. The jointing and cleavage are commonly more or less unevenly columnar, but in places there is a prominent blocky, subcubicl;IJ jointing. That the coal is in general resistant to weathering and has exc·ellent stocking qualities is shown by the condition of the coal where it is exposed in natural outcrops and by the comparatively fres~, unslacked condition of coal about the workings and dumps. Some of these exposed piles of ccal have been subject to weathering for as much as a dozen years.
A number of samples of the Straight Cliffs coal were collected for analysis. A partial statement of the analyses is given in the following table. The coal samples were carefully dried slightly above room temperature until the weight became constant.

The conditions are not very favorable for accumulations of oil or gas in cOinmercial quantities. In southeastern Utah about 1,350 feet of Pennsylvanian rocks are exposed in San Juan Canyon. They are dominantly fine-grained limestones but include some fine-grained, .essentially nonfeldspathic sandstones and thin layers of bituminous shale. The

The Triassic rocks of the l(aiparowits region include the Moenkopi formation, one of the most persistently oil-containing series in the plateau province. (See pl. 31, A.) In places oil_ occurs in the Shinarm,np conglomerate, also of Triassic a.ge. The sandstones of these formations are suitable reservoir rocks, and where oil-containing beds are covered by younger beds in favorable attitudes it would seem possible to find oil in commercial quantity. The Moenkopi is a shallow-water deposit that contains marine fossils, but it is mostly a " red beds " formation, which is commonly regarded as an unfavorable source rock for oil. The oil in the Shinarump is probably derived from the Moenkopi.

The Rock Creek anticline is a well-defined, rather symmetrical elongated dome, very low on the Circle Cliffs upwarp and practically at its southwest margin.

The only oil well in the Kaiparowits region is that drilled by .the Ohio Oil Co. near the topmost part of the Circle Cliffs upwarp, just west of W agonbox Mesa, in sec. 25, T. 34 S., R. 7 E. (unsurveyed). Drilling was begun January 24, 1921, with a standard rig. Work was retarded by difficulties ·of various sorts, and finally, after penetrating 122 feet of water-bearing

CONCLUSIONS
The l{aiparowits region contains oil-bearing fornlations as well as anticlinal structure, and in spite of adverse findings in the wells in the Circle Cliffs and near Caineville oil may possibly be found in commercial quantities. However, the difficulties and the expense of exploration are relatively great.
A factor that should not be overlooked in forming conclusions concerning the possibilities of obtaining oil in this region and the significance of the test wells is the possible or even probable absence of abundant water in the oil-containing beds. In partly water-· filled rock the oil will not be lifted by difference in specific gravity to the uppermost part of the anticlines but may be found on the flanks or even in the synclines, as in the San Juan field. It is perhaps significant that the marked surface indications of oil in beds that are exposed occur on the east side of the Circle Cliffs dome, where the dip is steep, and at the axis of the anticline in the Colorado River Canyon, where it is far below the summit of the dome in the Circle Cliffs. If oil is present in the Pennsylvanian or other beds beneath the surface at Circle Cliffs, and if it only pnrtly fills the reservoir space and is gathered on thf> flanks rnther than at the apex of the dome, the tes1 of the Ohio Oil Co. would be inconclusive. Except at 8uch a. point as "BenJ).ett's oil field," on the Colorado River, where the potentially oil-bearing formation~ lie within practicable drilling depth and in a favorable position on the anticline, it would be difficult or
