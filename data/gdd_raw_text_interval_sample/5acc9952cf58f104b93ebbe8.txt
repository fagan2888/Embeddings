objects are brieﬂy mislocalized before microsaccades [18].
Several other questions remain unanswered. Key among them is which causal mechanism gives rise to the observed link between altered visual responses and microsaccades. One interpretation, perhaps preferred by Chen et al. [1], is that the link reﬂects an inﬂuence of corollary discharge from oculomotor neurons on the sensitivity of visually responsive neurons. According to this view, the changes in visual sensitivity would occur only around the time of microsaccades. An alternative possibility, however, is that sensitivity across the visual ﬁeld ﬂuctuates continuously during ﬁxation even in the absence of microsaccades. In this view, attention-like ﬂuctuations of visual activity bias the likelihood and direction of spontaneous microsaccades [19]. A ﬁnal, related possibility — also ﬂagged by Chen et al. [1] — is that microsaccades and visual sensitivity are potentiated simultaneously through common and far-reaching network inﬂuences (such as those that manifest as neuronal oscillations [20]).
Regardless of the speciﬁc mechanism, the results of Chen et al. [1] suggest a strategy for visual analysis during ﬁxation that is characterized by frequent and coordinated shifts of visual sensitivity and eye position. Their results are an intriguing demonstration of the interplay between sensory, attentional, and motor systems and highlights the active nature of vision in primates.

Individuals, and cells, vary in their ability to tolerate aneuploidy, an unbalanced chromosome complement. Tolerance mechanisms can be karyotype-speciﬁc or general. General tolerance mechanisms may allow cells to beneﬁt from the phenotypic plasticity conferred by access to multiple aneuploid states.

At ﬁrst glance, it would appear that aneuploidy, an imbalanced chromosome complement, should be a universally negative state for cells. Aneuploidy perturbs the relative copy number of large numbers of genes simultaneously. Thus, it has the potential to disrupt biological processes carried out by any or all of the hundreds of genes that reside on the

aneuploid chromosome(s). Aneuploidy, which results from mistakes in chromosome segregation when cells divide in mitosis or meiosis, is the leading cause of miscarriage, a major source of birth defects, and rampant in cancer. The most common and well-known aneuploidy in humans is an extra copy of chromosome 21 (trisomy 21), which

causes Down syndrome (Figure 1). Down syndrome encompasses a wide array of traits, including characteristic facial features, hearing and vision impairment, heart abnormalities and mild or moderate intellectual disability. Each of these traits shows varying degrees of expressivity and penetrance, i.e. variability in the severity of the trait and the proportion of individuals that exhibit it. For example, some people with Down syndrome may have relatively minor heart defects or no defects at all. These individuals are exciting to geneticists because they suggest that nature has uncovered means of ameliorating perturbations that would have otherwise caused severe disease phenotypes. Understanding these socalled protective alleles may lead to new therapies that buffer the harmful effects of aneuploidy and other forms of copy number variation.
A recent publication by Hose and colleagues [1] explored whether some individuals, in this case natural isolates of

the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, could tolerate aneuploidy better than others, speciﬁcally the commonly used laboratory strains. The authors had reason to suspect that this might be the case. First, several labs, including their own, had found that aneuploidy is relatively common in wild strains [1,2]. Aneuploidy is also common in pathogenic fungi, particularly in strains isolated from drug-treated hosts [3]. Finally, aneuploidy is routinely found in laboratory experiments performed with wild-derived strains of yeast [4,5]. These results beg the question, if aneuploidy has such strong negative consequences, why is it so common in natural isolates?
One possible explanation is that aneuploidy is not as detrimental to wild strains as one might predict from studies with lab strains. To test this hypothesis, Hose and colleagues [1] compared aneuploid wild strains to genetically similar euploid (non-aneuploid) wild strains. Yeast grow slowly when they are

sick or under stress, and this growth defect is associated with a speciﬁc expression pattern of a relatively large set of RNA transcripts (the environmental stress response genes, ESR) [6,7]. Several studies have shown that aneuploid laboratory yeast strains often exhibit slow growth and, under some conditions, induce the ESR [8,9]. In contrast, the aneuploid wild yeast strains studied by Hose et al. displayed little if any growth defect and failed to induce the ESR.
Why might some cells tolerate imbalanced chromosome copy numbers so well? One possibility is that aneuploidy is somehow advantageous to the cell and so tolerance for a speciﬁc aneuploidy has been selected. There are a number of examples where the presence of an extra chromosome, or chromosomes, confers a selective advantage to cells under speciﬁc conditions. For example, aneuploidy quickly arose in experiments examining the response of a laboratory yeast strain to heat stress, and provided a growth advantage sufﬁcient to overcome the general loss of ﬁtness also associated with the presence of an extra copy of chromosome three [10]. Studies examining panels of yeast strains with different chromosome imbalances indicated that, under conditions that were suboptimal for growth of the euploid strains, some aneuploids grew better than their euploid counterparts [9]. Aneuploidy also arises frequently in clinical isolates of pathogenic fungi, where it can confer resistance to antifungal drugs [3]. Interestingly, individuals with Down syndrome have a lower risk of developing many types of cancer [11], suggesting that aneuploidy can also have beneﬁcial effects in humans.
If aneuploid wild strains of yeast have derived selective advantage(s) from the speciﬁc aneuploidy that they harbor, those strains would be under selective pressure to minimize the negative effects associated with that chromosome imbalance. That is, some wild yeast strains may both beneﬁt from, and have adapted to, their aneuploid state. In contrast, laboratory strains that have recently become aneuploid may not yet have adapted to this state as effectively. Adaptation in the wild strains could either be a general effect, conferring resistance to the negative effects of many or even all

aneuploid states, or could be a speciﬁc adaptation to only the current chromosome imbalance. If adaptation is speciﬁc, then forcing wild strains to acquire new aneuploid states, i.e. copy number imbalances of different chromosomes, would be as deleterious to their growth as it is to the laboratory strains. Surprisingly, Hose and colleagues found that this was not the case. Wild isolates of yeast were also resistant to the negative effects of newly acquired aneuploidies, suggesting that they possess a general, rather than a chromosome-speciﬁc, tolerance of aneuploidy.
Selection for generalized aneuploidy tolerance suggests that the ability to transition to multiple aneuploid states offers cells some substantial beneﬁt. In single-celled eukaryotes, such as yeasts, this could take the form of rapid adaptation to ﬂuctuating environmental conditions for which different aneuploidies provide selective advantages at different times. Importantly, and in contrast to spontaneous mutations, aneuploidy can be both gained and lost at a relatively high frequency. This reversibility makes aneuploidy a particularly useful strategy for micro-organisms to adapt to rapidly changing or rare environmental conditions. In this way, having small proportions of cells harbor a variety of aneuploidies could serve as a bet hedging strategy [5] if some of those cells are better able to weather severe environmental perturbations. Those individuals would then have a relatively easy means of reverting to their previous state if favorable conditions return; or if new conditions persist, the aneuploidy could be maintained until a more efﬁcient response to selection evolves [10].
Thus, it appears that some microorganisms have the ability to tolerate aneuploidy and to beneﬁt from the phenotypic plasticity that it can confer. But could the same be true of some human cells? Aneuploidy is very common in cancer cells and may be both a driver of cellular transformation, by increasing the expression of oncogenes relative to tumor suppressors, and a result

of the disordered cellular processes associated with tumor cells [12]. Once aneuploid, selective pressure for tolerance of aneuploidy could then apply to these cells. Surprisingly, several reports have also measured a high frequency of aneuploid cells in normal human and mouse tissues, including reports of 50% of hepatocytes [13] and 20% of neurons, with a variety of speciﬁc aneuploidies observed [14,15]. However, a more recent study using single cell sequencing across a variety of tissues found the prevalence of aneuploidy in liver and brain to be low [16]. The continued improvement of DNA sequencing technology, including methods for whole genome sequencing from single cells in situ [17], will soon facilitate experiments on a scale sufﬁcient to deﬁnitively address just how prevalent mammalian mosaic aneuploidy really is. If aneuploidy does exist at appreciable frequencies in mammalian tissues, the next question must be, are these aneuploid cells carrying out specialized functions? If so, mechanisms for general and speciﬁc tolerance of aneuploidy may exist in humans, as they do in microorganisms.
