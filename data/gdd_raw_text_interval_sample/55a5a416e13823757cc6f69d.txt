A Selected Bibliography of References on Geology, Hydrology, and Geochemistry of the Midwestern Basins and Arches Region Ohio, Indiana, Michigan, and Illinois

By Anthony Robinson and E. F. Bugliosi

Abstract
This report contains selected references used for the Midwestern Basins and Arches Regional Aquifer System Analysis project of the U.S. Geological Survey. The project was begun in 1988 to study the geologic framework, hydrology, and geochemistry of the surficial and the Silurian and Devonian carbonate-rock aquifers in the Midwestern Basins and Arches Region. The area of data collection is 90,000 square miles and includes parts of Ohio, Indiana, Michigan, and Illinois. Geologic, hydrologic, and geochemical references that apply to the hydrogeology and geochemistry of the region were collected and are presented in this bibliography by State and by geologic, hydrologic, and geochemical categories for each State.
INTRODUCTION
The need for regional ground-water information for the United States became critical during the 1970's after a period of severe drought. In response to this need, the U.S. Geological Survey Regional Aquifer System Analysis (RASA) program was created by Congress in 1977 and began operation in 1978. Twenty-eight regional aquifer systems were identified for study under the RASA program. The purpose of the Midwestern Basins and Arches RASA study (fig. 1), which began in 1988 and was scheduled for completion in September 1994, is to investigate the geologic framework, hydrology, and geochemistry of the regional aquifer system that consists of carbonate

rocks of Silurian and Devonian age and glacial deposits of Pleistocene age within a 90,000-squarcmile area (fig.l) that encompasses parts of Ohio, Indiana, Michigan, and Illinois.
Purpose and Scope
This report is provided to help promote a comprehensive understanding of the literature that pertains to the Midwestern Basins and Arches region and to present a systematic overview of this literature. The information provided in this report, which should be of value in literature searches on the geology, hydrology, and water chemistry of the Midwest, includes many of the sources of information that were compiled and used in the analysis of the Midwestern Basins and Arches RASA study. This report does not include all the literature used for this study; instead, only the major publications are included. For example, a number of consultants' reports were used as data sources but were not listed in the bibliography because of copyright and privacy issues.
Acknowledgments
The authors wish to thank the personnel of the Ohio and Indiana Geological Surveys, and the major universities within each State, for their cooperation.

2 Selected Bibliography on Geology, Hydrology, and Geochemistry, Midwestern Basins and Arches Region

BIBLIOGRAPHIC FORMAT
The compilation of references that follows is arranged first by State (the largest number of references pertain to Indiana and Ohio) and second by geology, hydrology, and geochemistry. Some references may be duplicated in different sections of this bibliography if a substantial part of the reference pertains to more than one topic (geology, hydrology, or geochemistry) or if the reference pertains to areas within several States. References that could not be classified in those abovementioned categories (for example, census data) were categorized as miscellaneous.
Basic streamfiow and ground-water-level data were used extensively for the Midwestern Basins and Arches RASA study. However, sources of basic data are not referenced individually. Instead, the reader is directed to local U.S. Geological Survey offices for copies of annual water-resources data reports or customized data retrievals. Copies of the annual data reports can also be found in many university libraries.

In addition to the references listed in this report, a number of reports dealing with aquifer tests were examined for the study. Many of these reports were obtained from private consulting firms and were released for a specific publication only. A listing of these consultants and the city in which they are located is given below:
