GEOLOGIC MAP AND GUIDE OF THE ISLAND OF OAHU, HAWAII
BY HAROLD T. STEARNS
FOREWORD
This bulletin, although designated Bulletin 2, is actually the fourth of a series published by the Division of Hydrography of the Territory of Hawaii. All four of the bulletins thus far published relate to the geology and ground-water resources of the island of Oahu.1 Together they present the results obtained on this island in the program of ground-water investigation of the Territory that has been conducted in cooperation with the Geological Survey, of the United States Department of the Interior. Bulletin 5 which is in preparation will describe the progress made in developing the g round-water resources of Oahu since Bulletin 1 was issued.
1See last p age for t itles of other bulletins.

2 GEOLOGIC MAP AND GUIDE OF OAHU
In Bulletin 2 is presented the detailed geologic map of Oahu that has resulted from this investigation. The base for this map is the new topographic map of Oahu prepared by the Topographic Branch of the Geological Survey. This bulletin also contains a guide to the geology along the main highways, which can be used advantageously in connection with the geologic map.
For 18 years the writer has had the great privilege of working under the technical direction of Mr. 0. E. Meinzer, geologist in charge of the Division of Ground Water, U. S. Geological Survey. Nearly two decades ago Mr. Meinzer envisioned the great benefits that the people of Hawaii would derive from a thorough study of the groundwater resources of these islands. He also recognized that a full knowledge of these resources could be obtained only by a complete understanding of the geology of the islands and the processes which formed them. This bulletin is one of a series that has been made possible largely as a result of his broad vision.
Credit is due Mr. W. 0 . Clark for the location of all the dikes shown on plate 2 in the headwaters of Kamananui Stream near the north end of the Koolau Range, and to Dr. C. K. Wentworth for about a dozen dikes north of Kaimuki. Messrs. 0. E. Meinzer, G. R. Mansfield, M. H. Carson, G. A. Macdonald, and S. H. Elbert kindly criticized the manuscript. Mr. Harry L. Taeuber designed the cover and with James Y. Nitta prepared the illustrations. Their work has greatly enriched this bulletin.

THE GEOLOGIC MAP
The topographic maps of 15-minute quadrangles, on a scale of 1 to 20,000 (approximately 3 inches to the mile), were used in the field as a base for the geologic mapping. The data were then transferred to the new topographic map of Oahu, which is on a scale of 1 to 62,500. The resulting geologic map is reproduced as plate 2 (in pocket) of this report. Some of the outcrops are too small to be shown on this smaller map. Plate 2 of this report was listed as plate 2 in Bulletin 1, which was, however, published without the map because of the time required to prepare and engrave the topographic base and the geologic map. The geologic structure sections at the bottom of plate 2 were not described in Bulletin 1, but are discussed below.
SECTION AA'
Section AA' extends from a point at sea 4Yz miles southwest of the mouth of Lualualei Valley through Kolekole Pass to a point at sea 9 miles off Hauula on the northeast side of the Koolau Range as shown by the line on the map (pl. 2). This section was chosen to show the deep submergence of Lualualei Valley, the structure of 'the caldera of the Waianae Volcano, the overlap of the Koolau lavas on the eroded Waianae surface, and the structure of the main rift zone of the Koolau Volcano. The depth of drowning of Lualualei Valley is established by a well near the axis of the valley which did not encounter bedrock until a depth of 1,200 feet had been reached. 2 The preerosion surface of the Waianae caldera is doubtless much more complicated than shown in this section, and the caldera may have been wider. The lava beds dipping away from the caldera in the head wall of Lualualei Valley and the breccias in Puu Kailio nearby that accumulated chiefly as talus at the foot of the caldera wall locate definitely the ea.st wall of the caldera as shown in the section. A small patch of post-Waianae basalt too small to show in the section or on the map is exposed at Kolekole Pass.

4 GEOLOGIC MAP AND GUIDE OF OAHU
The overlap of the Koolau lavas upon the Waianae rocks is unknown below sea level, but sufficient structure is revealed in Kaukonahua Canyon near Schofield Barracks to indicate that the upper Koolau lavas flowed into an amphitheater-headed valley cut in Waianae lavas. Such lavas would dam the streams flowing from this amphitheater and cause them to drop their sediment. At times all the streams would sink into the permeable fresh Koolau flows, resulting in rapid fan building. For this reason the upper Koolau lavas are shown interfingering with gravel.
It is believed that very little of the Koolau Volcano has been eroded along the line of this section except on the northeast or windward side. Erosion along the crest of the range has proceeded just far enough to expose a few dikes. Large volumes of ground water are probably stored between dikes in this area because the rainfall is heavy and the streams have not yet cut deep enough to drain many of the dike-walled compartments containing water.
The undersea part of the section off this northeast coast is hypothetical. As elsewhere around Oahu it is assumed that the marine limestones interfinger with the earthy sediments dropped by streams at their mouths.
SECTION BB'
Section BB' extends from a point at sea 4 miles southwest of Honolulu across the Koolau Range near Nuuanu Pali to a point at sea 9Yz miles off Mokapu Peninsula, as shown by the line on plate 2. A reconstruction of the Koolau caldera has been attempted by the dotted line indicating the pre-erosion surface of the Koolau Volcano based on the outcrops of the lavas and breccias of the caldera complex. The rocks are poorly exposed in this area hence the complexities are probably much greater than shown. The structure is thus in part hypothetical.
The throat breccia shown in the section fills one of the deep ~its in the old caldera. It is shown tapering downward m the manner characteristic of throat breccias exposed in Hawaii.

An hypothesis to account for such pits is as follows. At ·the intersection of rift zones in Hawaii there commonly develops a weak place where repeated fissuring allows rocks broken by this process to move downward into the magma chamber. Here they are either remelted or floated upward in erupting magmas. This place is one of nearly constant tumescence owing to the lava repeatedly forcing its way upward. The swallowing process soon engulfs the rocks above until finally a funnel-shaped shaft is formed. The size of the pit eventually developed depends apparently upon the depth of the bottom of the funnel, the rapidity of disposal of the rock fragments at the bottom, and the length of time the process continues. Explosions may loosen the rocks in the funnel and thereby speed up the process, as at Kilauea in 1924, but explosions are not essential. Engulfment concurrent with and following the Kilauea explosion accounted for more material than was blown out.'l The broken rock that accumulates in such a pit is called throat breccia.
A syncline is shown in the Kailua amygdaloidal basalt northeast of the throat breccia in this section. This is based on observed dips in Puu Papaa and upon the new interpretation that the Kailua lavas accumulated in the Koolau caldera and the synclinal structure was induced by sagging due to removal of support. The synclinal structure is shown hypothetically to a depth of 3,000 feet below sea level or to the bottom of the section.
The lava beds undersea in the southwest end of the section are drawn flatter than those on the land because the submarine soundings show a distinct submarine shelf in this area. This shelf may have been produced by the lavas ponding against the Penguin Bank, which is probably a submerged older volcanic mass extending southwestward from Molokai Island.
Only limestone and volcanics are shown above the Koolau basalt on the northeast end of the section. Possibly earthy sediments are interbedded with the limestone as elsewhere around the island, but no logs of wells are available in this area by which this possibility can be verified.

GUIDE TO THE GEOLOGY ALONG THE MAIN HIGHWAYS
INTRODUCTION
This road guide has been prepared to meet the constant demand for more knowledge about the geology of Oahu and should greatly increase the usefulness of the geologic map. Many kinds of geologic phenomena are found on the island: dissected as well as recent volcanic craters and fissures from which lava and ash were erupted, landslides and fossiliferous volcanic mud flows, spectacular features of marine, stream, and wind erosion, conspicuous evidences of great submergence and emergence, coral reefs, stream and marine terraces, deltas, fans, tropical rain belts and deserts with their associated contrasting types of weathering and erosion. This concentration of so many diverse geologic features in such a small area makes Oahu outstanding among the islands of the world. This verdurecovered island surrounded by a blue sea is an ideal place to become acquainted with earth processes and products. Moreover, many of these geologic features are readily reached by automobile.
The logs given on the following pages have been made for an autoist travelling the main highways around the island starting at the Kamehameha statue on King Street, Honolulu (pl. 1). It is assumed that the traveler will have available the street map of Honolulu issued free by the Hawaii Tourist Bureau. The mileage reads up if driving clockwise around the island and down if going counterclockwise. The route from Haleiwa to Wahiawa is over the new highway not shown on plate 2. Likewise, the route to Waianae is over the new Waipahu cut-off, although this road is not shown on plate 2. The mileage varies slightly with different odometers due to many factors, but a sufficient number of landmarks are given so that frequent checks can be made. A few of the main side roads having interesting geologic exposures are also included (pl. 1).

INTRODUCTION

7

The Polynesians long a g o recognized the difficulty a traveller going around an island meets in keeping oriented. Therefore, they have the useful words makai (toward the sea) and mauka (toward the mountains). Throughout the gui.de the equivalent English words "seaward" and "inland" are used. The terms "windward" and "leeward" are also indispensable in an island lying in the path of the northeast trade winds because these winds determine the climate which in turn influences rates of stream and marine erosion on the two sides of the island. In this text "windward" always refers to the north and northeast, and "leeward" to the south and southwest.
It is assumed that a person using the guide will have available Bulletin 1 of this series to which constant reference is made for detailed accounts. A useful addition to the trip is the geologic account of Oahu entitled "An Island Is Born," by Norah D. Stearns, which can be obtained from any library in Honolulu.

SYNOPSIS OF THE GEOLOGIC HISTORY
Oahu began its geologic history as two separate submarine volcanoes. (See above fi g ure.) These gradually built two islands (pl. 3, A) . Both volcanoes were built over three sets of fissures intersecting at a summit crater and both at frequent intervals erupted highly fluid basaltic flows that built up shield-shaped cones. The Waianae Volcano gradually developed a large summit caldera near the present site of Kolekole Pass, and also a high, steep fault cliff that formed a wall bounding the southwest margin of the two main rift zones (pl. 3, C). Streams eroded the southwest slope now that it was protected by this cliff from flows, and lava continued to accumulate in the great caldera until this depression nearly if not entirely filled up. Near the close of this epoch, lava overflowed the northwest end of the fault cliff and ran down some of the valleys northwest of the present site of Waianae and a few bulky cinder cones were formed at the source of several of the flows along the two main rifts (pl. 4, A) . In the meantime the Koolau Volcano grew larger with a pronounced elongation northwestward as a result of copious flows from the northwest rift zone. Finally, the Waianae Volcano died, the sea pounded back its shore into great cliffs, and torrential streams carved great valleys, especially on the southwest side where the streams were older and the rocks weaker. These great valleys are now called Nanakuli, Lualualei, Waianae, Makaha, and Keaau.
Meanwhile Koolau flows filled up the ocean between the Koolau and Waianae Volcanoes and joined the two moun-

tains into a single island (pl. 4, B). What is now called the Schofield Plateau resulted from the Koolau flows banking against the Waianae Mountain. Simultaneously a caldera about 4 miles across developed at the intersection of the rift zones near the present site of Kailua. Volcanic activity ceased and streams carved deep amphitheater-headed canyons in the Koolau Volcano. Meanwhile the streams of the Waianae Range had nearly dried up because the moist northeast trades were cut off by the g rowth of the
Koolau Volcano. Oahu was then about 1Yz times as large
as it is now, and the mouths of the streams of that time are today about 1,800 feet below sea level (pl. 5, A). The streams gradually destroyed the caldera and today only the roots of the former firepits remain near Kailua. The magnificent canyons ate away much of their interstream divides and eroded headward so far that some even captured leeward-flowing streams.
Next the island became submerg ed 2,000 to 3,000 feet, but the land rapidly re-emerged part of this amount and consequently few changes from wave attack are noticeable except the stripping away of the soil at the higher levels (pl. 5, C ). The re-emergence, however, was not simple but involved halts and partial resubmergence. Some of the later shore lines are well preserved in emerged reefs and beach deposits. The most important result of the shifting ocean level was the deep drowning of the great valleys and their subsequent sedimentation. This accounts for the ubiquitous flat valley floors. The complex history of the emergences and submergences is far from completely known, but the shore lines so far deciphered with their altitudes, in order from oldest to young est, are given below. Some of them have been determined from neighboring islands.4 The shifting of shore lines is partly due to changes in ocean level accompanying glaciation and deglaciation of the earth during the Pleistocene, but probably more effective have been the great changes in the configuration of the ocean floors due to widespread earth movements.

During the late history of shifting sea level, volcanism was renewed near the old Koolau center of activity, and at intervals of a few hundred or a few thousand years down to Recent time vents were blasted through the coral reefs, as at Diamond Head, Salt Lake, Punchbowl, or the Koko craters, and firefountains played from cracks in the mountains and poured lavas into nearby valleys, as at Kalihi, Nuuanu, Kaneohe, Castle, Tantalus, or Sugar Loaf vents. ( See fig . 13, Bull. 1.) Many erupted during the Waipio low stand of the sea (pl. 6, A) . Thus, we find some lava flows that are interstratified with or lie upon gravel or coral reefs. Altogether 30 such secondary eruptions are now known on the Koolau Range and there is no reason to believe that others may not take place in the future. (See list, p. 11.) A few secondary, or post-erosional eruptions also occurred on the Waianae Range. Their age is not yet established but they appear to be older than the post-Koolau eruptions.
A more detailed account of the geolog ic history will be found in Bulletin 1, pages 174-179, and a description of the general character of the rocks is given in the stratigraphic tables followin g page 68 in Bulletin 1.

The low eminence in front of Round Top showing a reddish quarry face among the houses is Rocky Hill, a secondary cinder cone. Where the smooth grassy slopes of Round Top change inland to rocky ledges a small gulch is discernible. At this place the Sugar Loaf lava formed a firefall into Manoa Valley, flowed across M·anoa Valley to the east wall, and then seaward to Kapiolani Blvd. (fig . 3).

Manoa Valley is a typical amphitheaterheaded valley carved by stream erosion when the island stood at least 1,200 feet higher than at present. (For origin of such valleys, seep. 24, Bull. 1.) The depth to the bedrock floor of Manoa Valley is more than 1,000 feet at this point. The flat valley floor has been produced by slow filling with silt, sand, gravel, secondary volcanic deposits, and probably coral, as the island submerged. The highest point of the Koolau Range is the peak on the west side of the skyline at the head of the valley, Puu Konahuanui, altitude 3,105 feet.

edge of the road with hardened detrital limestone containing fossil shells and coral on its sides. The top of the limestone is 22.5 feet above sea level and was laid down during the Waimanalo stand of the sea. It is overlain by black marine mud and talus, and on the west side above 4 feet of mud is a block 6 feet wide of tan-colored Koko tuff. Other smaller outcrops nearby indicate that the Koko vents exploded after the sea had withdrawn from this point. The various vents along Koko fissure from which this ash was ejected are shown by the small red "c" on plate 2. Koolau aa and pahoehoe are exposed in this road cut. The lower half of the bank is pahoehoe. Its top is a red oxidized zone above which is an aa flow having two clinker beds. Overlying the aa is another pahoehoe flow. About 25 feet above the road in line with the red zone at the top of the pahoehoe flow is a small patch of fossiliferous conglomerate, 37.5 feet above sea level, left during one of the high stands of the sea preceding the Waipio low stand.

11 .60 A branch road turns seaward to Hanauma Crater and Bay. Along the road are exposed the steep in-dipping crater beds of tuff. From the rim of Hanauma Crater, 0.3
mile from the road junction, a view is obtained of Hanauma bench hewn in the crater wall by the 5-foot stand of the sea. Part of the crater rim was cut away by the ocean to form this lovely bay. The Koko Head ridge (fig. 6) was formed by at least 9 explosions along a fissure now covered by the tuff. (See alsop. 150 and pl. 18, Bull. 1.) The beach at Hanauma Bay sparkles with tiny green olivine crystals.

(See pl. 17, B and p. 151, Bull. 1.) The anticlinal structure along this highway might be misinterpreted as due to folding. It is due to deposition only. 12.90 The caverns in the bluffs here are formed by weathering of the tuff. 13.00 The tuff dipping inland on the seaward side of the highway is part of a cone destroyed by the ocean (fig. 6). 13.05 Trail to the Blow Hole. This spouting horn is caused by the sea rushing into a cave and spurting through a hole in the roof. It performs best during large swells. On the inland side of the highway is brown talus filling a gully cut in the tuff. Molokai Island is visible on clear days to the east. It is north of Lanai Island. 13.60 The fresh rock exposed on the seaward side of the highway is a recent pahoehoe flow from a cinder cone in Kalama Valley (fig. 6).

In the wall of this sink-hole is exposed reef limestone overlain by 6 inches of red soil which in turn is overlain by cross-bedded lithified dunes. Three shifts of sea level can be interpreted from this outcrop. The reef grew in a higher sea than at present as it extends above sea level. Next the sea fell below present level and the soil and dunes accumulated. Finally the sea rose, partly drowning the dunes.

of the Waianae Range skirted by a Recent emerged marine plain. (See pl. 10, A, Bull. 1.) 78.6J The surface here is a slightly eroded flow slope of the Koolau Range. To the west is the Schofield re-entrant and Kolekole Pass. This re-entrant is due to the Koolau lavas flowing into and partly filling an amphitheater-headed valley carved in the Waianae Range that drained to the east. Northwest of Kolekole Pass is M t. Kaala, the highest point on Oahu, altitude, 4,030 feet. The peak consists of massive dense lava flows that have resisted erosion. Kolekole Pass, a typical wind gap, was caused by Lualualei Valley decapitating the ancient Schofield Valley prior to its filling with Koolau lava. 7 .80 Junction ; road to Waialua. If one drives toward Waialua 4.25 miles and then 0.1 mile west on a side road into a grove of eucalyptus trees, the unconformity between the Waianae and Koolau basalts can be reached on foot by a rough steep descent of about 200 feet. (See p. 91 , Bull. 1.) The exposure is in the east wall of Kaukonahua Gulch in a gully used as a waste-way for surplus ditch water. 79.30 "Birthstones" or " Alii" stones, 0.1 mile west on a side road are weathered remnants of a massive Koolau lava flow. 79.()5 Deep cut showing weathered Koolau basalt. 79.75 North bridge over Wahiawa Reservoir. , .10 Wahiawa. 0.40 South bridge over Wahiawa Reservoir.

0.55 - 6. 15 Makua Cave or Kaneana (Cave of the god Kane) (fig. 21). One legend says that this cave connects with Kauai and that Madame Pele, the Hawaiian goddess of volcanoes, after building Kauai came to Oahu through this tunnel. Another legend states that it was the home of Kaneana, the shark-man deity. 1:;
The cave is about 450 feet long and trends S. 25 ° E. In places the roof is about 100 feet above the floor. The entrance is about 50 feet high and 45 feet wide. The south wall of the mouth of the cave consists of 8 feet of olivine aa overlain by a pahoehoe flow about 25 feet thick, which in turn is overlain by aa. There may be a slight downthrow to the south on the south side of the 2Yz-foot dike forming the north side of the cave. The dike on the south wall running inland along the trend of the cave is about 4 feet thick but it pinches out upward. Prior to the removal of the talus at the mouth, the cave was entered near the top of the present opening. The white line on the north wall marks the former upper limit of the talus that was removed during the excavation of the road. On the north wall 20 feet above the floor of the cave is coarse boulder conglomerate left by the sea on a ledge.
The cave is due to the enlargement by wave action of a fault crack that runs nearly parallel with a cross-jointed dike. The vertical grain of the dikes has facilitated wave quarrying. The ridge in which the cave is situated is in the heart of the Waianae dike complex (pl. 2) . Beyond the main opening is a series of chambers about 8 feet wide,

on the floors of which are 2 to 6 feet of consolidated calcareous sand containing smooth water-worn lava cobbles. The white coral sand is coated with a black tufa which makes the deposit resemble basalt. Numerous holes several inches to a foot in diameter and a foot or more deep pit the floor. These holes have fluted walls. The grooves are due to percolating water dropping from the roof and dissolving the limestone. The walls and roof are in many places coated with several inches of tufa which form tiny blunt-ended stalactites. The floor at the mouth of the cave is about 55 feet above sea level, but a short distance inside it is estimated to be only about 30 feet.

The drowning and subsequent alluviation have been so great that these remnants project above the surrounding material like islands in a sea of mud.

SEMI-PRECIOUS GEMS
There is considerable interest in local semi-precious gems on Oahu and many persons hunt them. However, they have relatively little commercial significance and the few that are sold derive their value chiefly as souvenirs. A description of the gems and the better known localities where they are found follows. The minerals of Oahu have been described by Eakle and Dunham.17
OLIVINE.-The gem peridot is yellowish-green and is cut from olivine (also known as chrysolite). It is the most prized gem in Hawaii and the only one with any market value elsewhere. Small crystals of olivine are found in many of the lava flows of Oahu, but crystals yielding gems one-quarter to one-half carat are scarce because of fractures. The largest gem olivine found on the island of Oahu that has come to the writer's attention was from a segregation of olivine found in the Tantalus firefountain debris in Manoa Valley. It weighed about 2 carats. Seg regations of olivine an inch or more across are common in the Koko (Kalama cone) , Pali, Salt Lake, and Hawaiiloa volcanics, in Mt. Kaala, and in the Waianae cones-Puu Kapolei, Puu Kapuai, and Puu Makakilo. They are occasionally seen elsewhere, as in the flows at the head of Lualualei and Waianae Valleys. Sing le crystals are common in the basalt at Waimea Quarry and at the north point of the Koolau Range near Kahuku, but only by lon g and diligent search is the collector rewarded with one without fractures. The green sand beaches of Diamond, Ulupau, and Koko heads are chiefly olivine but the crystals are small.
FELDSPAR.-Clear crystals of feldspar of pale-yellow color, variety labradorite, are easily obtained at Pohakea Pass in the Waianae Range. They are sold in the local gem trade as Hawaiian topaz. The writer has never seen

one from Oahu of commercial yellow color. Feldspar is very much softer and less brilliant than topaz.

OBSIDIAN. -Opaque black glass, popularly known as obsidian, is readily obtainable from the selvedge of dikes in the road cuts along the Kolekole Pass road and elsewhere in the Waianae and Koolau Range. It is cut into attractive opaque black gems, locally sold as jet, but it does not usually take as brilliant a polish as the mainland obsidian. Obsidian is very common in western United S t at e s.
QUARTZ. -Hexagonal crystals of clear quartz usually less than an inch long are found in the gulches in areas of Kailua basalt and dike complex (pl. 2). They are most common near Olomana Peak. A few have been found on Mokulua islets off Lanikai and some in the vicinity of Kolekole Pass. They weather out of cavities in the rocks where they were deposited from migrating solutions. A few of the clear ones have been cut and sold as Hawaiian diamonds. They are sold in the trade elsewhere as Mexican diamonds or "crystal" and have little monetary value.

CHALCEDONY, JASPER, AND OPAL.-In the rocks in the ridge separating Waianae and Lualualei Valleys and also in the Kailua area are mammillary translucent to transparent, waxy chalcedony, a cryptocrystalline variety of quartz. It occurs in cavities and as coatings on the rocks where it was deposited by water. Irregular pellets of chalcedony weathered out of the vesicles in the lavas usually have a pale blue color and when cut cabochon are quite attractive. They are locally called "moonstone," although feldspar, not quartz, is the "moonstone" of the trade. Clear varieties cut cabochon are locally called Pele's tears. Chalcedon y usually milky w hite or white tinged with blue or red, is also common in most of the quarries that yield other minerals. Banded chalcedony, also called agate, is found in gas cavities in the lavas, but it usually has poor color and is not suitable for gem use. Some of the agates carrying opaque specks slightly resemble moss agates and are so called by local collectors.

70 GEOLOGIC MAP AND GUIDE OF OAHU
Greenish-brown, yellowish-brown, reddish-brown, red, and lavender jasper, a variety of quartz, is common in Lualualei Valley and near Kailua. Pieces up to 6 inches across are found lying loose on the ground. The greenish and reddish varieties are pleasing when cut and most in demand for costume jewelry. It is a dull, hard, opaque mineral.
Opal, an amorphous form of silica, has a slightly lower specific gravity than chalcedony, but in appearance is not readily distinguishable. No gem-quality opal has been found on Oahu. A poor quality opal occurs as amygdaloidal fillings in the basalt in a road cut on the north side of Mauna Kuwale Ridge on the north side of Lualualei Valley.
ARAGONITE AND CALCITE.-Crystals of calcite are common in limestone quarries such as those near Waianae or Kailua. Aragonite has also been reported in the limestones. Crystals of calcite found on Diamond Head gave this eminence its name. Calcite is found also in cavities in the Kailua basalt and in Moiliili Quarry as dog-toothshaped crystals. Some varities of calcite, commonly the stalactitic masses, are cut and polished for book ends. The Waikakalaua or Dillingham Quarry above Waipahu (pl. 2) has yielded large quantities of hemispherical yellow-banded iron-stained calcite. It g enerally occurs with zeolite needles in cavities. Mr. Lorrin A. Thurston named them Pele's pearls and gave them considerable publicity about 1900. Several thousands of dollars worth
were sold at that time for beads, cuff links, a nd necklaces.
They are too soft for jewelry, but are in demand as a local product.
ZEOLITES.-Zeolites are common in the cavities in the Kailua basalt and are found lying loose in the gulches in this rock, especially west of Kailua. They comprise epistilbite (radiated spherical aggregations), laumontite (stubby vitreous white crystals), heulandite (pearly coffinshaped crystals often mistaken for mica) , and ptilolite (delicate tufts of white crystalline needles). Pale strawyellow nontronite is found associated with these minerals.

MINERAL RESOURCES

71

Zeolites are found also in the cavities in the Dillingham Quarry above Waipahu, Moiliili Quarry in Honolulu, and in the road cuts along the Kolekole Pass road in Lualualei Valley. Associated with the zeolites in Moiliili Quarry are thompsonite (brilliant pyramidal crystals) , nepheline (dull-white hexagonal crystals), pyroxene (slender lustrous dark-green to black, often bladed crystals) , and apatite (gray needle-like crystals). Some of the zeolites are cut for gem stones but zeolites are generally too soft to be satisfactory as gems.

ROAD METAL
Excellent road metal is found on Oahu. Massive layers of dense basalt are quarried extensively, production varying with the rate of construction. The largest quarry is at Moiliili in the terminal margin of the Sugar Loaf lava flow. These post-Koolau nephelite basalts are excellent for quarrying because of their massive fine-grained character and thin overburden. Koolau basalt is being quarried at Moanalua Gulch, Waimea, and Schofield Barracks. A large intrusive mass is quarried in Palolo Valley. The Koolau basalt is too thin-bedded and the dense part too discontinuous for satisfactory quarry operations from Honolulu eastward. This unfavorable character was induced by the conditions of accumulation, namely, (1) high fluidity; (2) nearness to the source ; (3) steep dips. Waianae basalt is quarried at Kolekole Pass and Kawaihapai. At Waimanalo, Kailua, and Laie lithified dune sand is quarried for surfacing secondary roads and for road foundations. It does not crush well because of the thin bedding planes present. Reef limestone is quarried for road metal at Kahuku, Waimea, Barbers Point, and Testa Quarry in Lualualei Valley. At the Testa Quarry the rock breaks into suitable fragments because of the numerous small cavities where shells and coral have dissolved out of a limestone that before consolidation was a limy mud. The ledge is 35 to 60 feet thick and rests upon earthy sediments. This reef was laid down during the 95-foot stand of the sea. Total production of crushed basalt on Oahu

72 GEOLOGIC MAP AND GUIDE OF OAHU
was 449,600 cubic yards in 1938 valued at $742,600. About 113,000 cubic yards of crushed limestone valued at about $196,400 was produced also. Thus, nearly a million dollars worth of crushed rock was produced in 1938.
SAND AND GRAVEL
Calcareous beach sand can be obtained readily on Oahu. It consists of foraminifera, comminuted shells, coral, coralline algae, and echinoderm spines. The deposits are shown on plate 2. It is used for the manufacture of lime and for plaster and cement. The Honolulu Chamber of Commerce reports that 58,900 cubic yards of sand was sold during 1938 for $109,1 00. Basaltic sand and gravel is practically unobtainable in commercial quantities because the streams are too torrential to wash out the mud. The so-called "black sand" from Round Top is a fresh black glassy firefountain debris. It is used chiefly as surfacing material in yards because it does not get muddy in wet weather. It is excellent material for covering red soil which stains textiles so badly when wet and tracked into a home.
The olivine beach sands at Diamond, Koko, and Mokapu heads have potential value for making decorative concrete floors and objects of art.
LIME
Reef limestone is quarried near Waianae, Waipahu, and Kahuku for the manufacture of lime. Most of the lime is used for refining sugar. The chief producer is the Waianae Lime Co. Their output was 8,22 1 tons in 1937. The newly organized Hawaiian Gas Products Co. has a vertical kiln with a capacity of 25 tons per day. They use rock from Testa Quarry and manufacture quick lime and carbon dioxide for dry ice and the bottling industry. Kahuku Plantation used 380 tons of beach sand and Oahu Sugar Co. quarried 780 tons of limestone for lime in 1938. Total production in 1938 was about 4,000 tons of lime valued at about $54,000. All the lime used in the sugar industry on

MINERAL RESOURCES

73

Hawaii and Kauai comes from Oahu. About 1 percent of the production is used for plaster and a very small amount for fertilizer.

BUILDING STONE
Large quantities of basalt talus from the Koolau Range east of Honolulu, especially from the Kalama lava flow near Koko Head, are used annually for building stone and walls. Rock with pitted surfaces partly covered with lichens, the so-called "moss rock," brings the highest prices when used for buildings and walls because it makes them look old immediately after construction. Current prices are about 75 cents a cubic yard. It ex ists in great abundance at the foot of cliffs in the dry parts of the Waianae Range also.
Attractive walls are made also from blocks cut from cavernous coral limestone quarried from the reef near Moana Park, Honolulu. This is in demand because of its long use on tropical islands. It brings about 40 cents per square foot, measured on the face of a wall. Gray basalt from Moiliili and Palolo Quarries is also split into blocks and small quantities are used for building purposes. It is too sombre in color to be in great demand and the fresh surfaces are not considered attractive. Some is used for tombstones.
A few buildings and walls have been made of Diamond Head tuff. It works nicely when "green" but the demand is small.
A popular stone is lithified beach sand, most of which is quarried near Barbers Point. Other deposits exist on Mokapu Peninsula and in various places along the windward shore. The beach limestone used in the construction of the Honolulu Academy of Arts was brought from Molokai but stone of equal quality exists on Oahu. Small quantities of lithified dune sand are quarried in Kahala, Kahuku, and Kailua for building stone. The coarser-grained varieties are considered more attractive.

CLAY

In the 19th Annual Report1 of the U.S. Geological Sur-

vey the following statement regarding kaolin in the terri-

tory was made:

·

"Kaolin.-Pockets of large size and sometimes very

pure material have been found. This mineral results from

the decomposition of the rock-constituent minerals, espe-
cially feldspars, ''' * *. The scale upon which the rock al-

teration has gone on warrants the assumption that work-

able deposits of kaolin may be numerous."

Not until 193519 when Thomas Wells found a small deposit of ceramic clay near the summit of the Koolau Range on the Castle Trail was clay put to commercial use. It has to be packed out on mule back and is altogether too expensive and scarce to be used for anything but expensive decorative pottery sold locally.

It occurs only in thin layers in areas of heavy rainfall under humus where, during weathering of basalt, organic acids have leached the iron from the ferromagnesian minerals and altered the feldspars to kaolinite . ~0

Three complete chemical analyses show a variable composition, silica ranging from 34 to 57 percent, alumina 22 to 26 percent, iron oxides 3 to 9 percent. Titanium oxide was approximately 14 percent in two samples which is unusually high for clays.21

PUMICE
A small deposit of lump pumice containing a few phenocrysts of labradorite of intermediate composition exists in a terrace at the mouth of Makaha Gulch. It was evidently washed ashore from some prehistoric eruption, possibly far away from the Hawaiian Islands. The index of the
