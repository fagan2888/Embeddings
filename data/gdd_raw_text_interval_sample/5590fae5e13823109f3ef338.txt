A SUNMARY INTERPRETATION OF GEOLOGIC, HYDROLOGI C1 AND GEOPHYSICAL DATA FOR YUCCA VALLEY, NEVADA TEST SITE, riTE COUNTY~ NEVADA

INTRODUCTION
Scope of report
This report summarizes an interpretation of the geology of Yucca Valley to depths of about 2,300 feet below the surface, the ;characteristic features of ground water in Yucca and Frenchman Valleys, and the seismic, gravity, and magnetic data for these valleys. Compilation of data, preparation of illustrations, and writing of the report were completed during the period December 26 9 1958 to January 10, 1959. Some of the general conclusions must be considered as tentative until more data are available.
This work was done by the u. S. Geological Survey on behalf of Albuquerque Operations Office, u. s. Atomic Energy Commission.
Source and limitations of data
The attached annotated bibliography contains titles of reports ; available to the public, which are concerned with the geologic, hydrologic, and geophysical features of Yucca and Frenchman Valleys. The principal reports are those by Johnson and Hibbard (1957) and Piper (1952). R. F. Brown supplied valuable lithologic

details ,-on well:-?. ·The geo.J.og.y :_of Yucc.a Vall.~Y ~Ls _.adequately :known in the
Jangle area from shallow trenches and :pits and. 4 test holes
(maximum depth of 502 feet) but elsewhere inf'oz111ation has been
obtained from 2 wells, lj8oo and 2;~272 feet deep,:~ re's:pectivelyo
Geophysical surveys in the Jangle area in 1952 and recent ·gravity
and aeromagnetic surveys have outlined same of the general subsurface features in Yucca Valley. However, much more geo~hysical work
coordinated with deep drilling is needed before the subsurface
geology of Yucca Valley can be adequately defined.
Physical features
Yucca Valley is a broad north-trending intermontane valley in
the northeastern part of the Nevada Test Site (fig. 1). It is about 20 miles long and 7 miles wide arld has an area. of approxi:ma:tely 135 square miles. Yucca Playa, with an area of approxi:ma.tely 6 square
miles, in the southern end of the valley, has an altitude of 3,925
feet above sea. level, whereas along the northern and higher :parts of the valley the altitude is about 4, 500 feet. ~.a.e average slope within Yucca Valley is about 23 feet per mile to the south. Many parts of Yucca Valley are accessible from Mercury by paved roads; however, for travel beyond main roads, 4-wheel-d.rive vehicles are generally necessary.

GEOLOGY OF YUCCA VALLEY
General statement
The geology of Yucca Valley has been descri.bed by Johnson and Hibbard (1957) and by Piper (1952). The central part of the vall ey consists of unconsolidated detrital material that is locally as much as 1,530 feet thick. Underlying the valley fill are tuffaceous rocks that, on the basis of drill-hole data, are as much as 1:~325 feet thick; the total thickness of tuffaceous rocks is unknown. The mountains that surround Yucca Valley consist of complexly faulted tuffs of the Oak Spring formation of Tertiary age underlain by several thousand feet of faulted and folded interbedded carbonate rocks,
siliceous shale, and quartzites of Paleozoic age (fig. 1). In the
northern part of the valley, a granite mass has intruded and altered the Paleozoic carbonate rocks. Yucca fault, a north-trending normal f ault downthrown on the east side, divides Yucca Valley (fig. 1). Results of gravity surveys indicate a deep trough which roughly parallels the f aul t; in the southern part of Yucca Valley the gravity low is on the downthrown side but it lies west of the fault in vicinity of the Jangle area (fig. 2).
Stratigraphy of valley fill
According to Johnson and Hibbard (written communication, 1953) the valley fill is composed of interfingering and lenticular beds of unconsolidated detrital material transported from the surrounding mountains by

i ntermittent s treams. In shallow excavations in -che Jangle area in the northern part of Yucca Valley, the valley f ill is characterized by thin lenticular beds that are as much as 5 feet thick and are traceable along the strike for as much as 1,000 feet. The lithologic logs of 4 test holes (table 1) in the Jangle area (fig. 1) are incomplete; however, the individual beds ~ as shown by change in texture, range from 1 to about 50 feet in thickness. At depths below 500 feet the thickness of the individual beds is unknown.
The valley fill is composed of detrital material that ranges from clay and silt (less than 0.05 mm diameter) to cobbles (64 to 256 mm diameter) and boulders (256 mm to 1 meter diameter). Quantitative data on grain size distribution have been obtained from 60 samples collected in trenches and pits at depths of 5 to 35 feet below the surface in the Jangle area (fig. 1). According to Johnson and Hibbard (written communication, 1953) 50 percent of the material ranged in grain size from 0.009 to 0.39 inch and averaged 0.082 inch in diameter. The fragments that passed through a 100-mesh screen (openings of 0.0058 inch) constitute from 3 to 31 and averaged 13 percent by volume of the sample. The largest particles ranged from 1 to 12 inches in diameter. Information on textures of the valley fill at depth is limited to logs of 4 test holes in the Jangle area and from the logs of wells 3 and 7 (tables 2 and 3) (fig. 1). The test holes range from 177 to 502 feet in depth. Logs of these holes (Piper, 1952, p. 60-61) show that sand (0.05 to 2 mm) fragmehts

comprise 22 to 47 percent; gravel (2 to 256 mm) 51 to 76 percent and boulders (>256 mm) 1 to .3 percent of the valley fill. On the basi.s of these lithologic logs there is no apparent progressive change in texture of the fill with depth. The variability of the texture of the valley fill to a depth of 500 feet is well shown in the detailed
logs of the 4 test holes. In general, the individual lithologies
are not traceable between the test holes, which are a minimum of about 2,100 feet apart. In the wells (J and 7) that penetrated the alluvium, the distribution of sand, gravel, and boulders is about the same as near the surface.
Silt and clay are the dominant components of Yucca Playa, the lowest part in the present Yucca Valley. Thickness of the Playa sediments is unknown but in the Frenchman Playa to the south (figo 1) they are at least 175 feet thick (Johnson and Hibbard, written communication, 1953)o Studies of seismic velocities made in Frenchman Playa indicate velocities of about 2,600 feet per second. From these data it is inferred that velocities in Yucca Playa are similar.
Composition of the valley fill has been determined from pebble
counts made on the surface and from lithologic logs of the 4 test
holes and the 2 wells. Pebble counts made by Johnson and Hibbard (written communication, 1953) in several parts of Yucca Valley have shown that there is a direct relation between the dominant lithic fragment in the valley fill and the bordering bedrock. Thus the fill of Yucca Valley is inferred to contain tuff, limestone, dolomite, and quartzite detritus along the western and eastern sides; granite fragments in the northern part;

19
and to consist mainly of tuff :i.n the northeastern part. On the basis of lithologic logs of the test holes in the J&"'lgle area (fig. J..) the valley fill is predominantly fragments of' limestone and tuff; the· absence of quartzite fragments is note\·Torthy in the fill in the Jangle area. and indicates most of the lithic fragments were derived from the rocks exposed to the east of this a.rea.. The logs of wells
3 and 7 show that tuff, limestone, quartz, basalt, and felsite are the
common fragments in the valley fill :i.n the central part of Yucca Valley.
Calcium carbonate cement(caliche)is common in the fill exposed in trenches and pits in the northern part of Yucca Valley. According
to Piper {1952, p. 18) caliche occurs as discontinuous and irregular
beds as much as 2 feet thick; individual beds are traceable along strike for as much as 900 feet. More commonly the caliche occurs as thin vein:J,ets and irregular nw.sses scattered throu.ghout the valley fill.. As is indicated from stratigraphic sections measured in the sur'i'ace cuts, Cf\liche constitu.tefJ as much as 15 percent by volume of valley fill. tO a depth of 3 5 teet j ;however, thls value should not be · considered to be eharacteristlc of the total vailey i'ill. Lithologic logs (Piper, 1952, p. 60-61) of the 4 test holes :tn Jangle area. indica.te· that the valley f'ill is "lightly to mediu.-n-ho.rd" cemented to depths of 502 feet; the c;:oa.rse-cra.ined valley fill is better cemented than the silts and. sands. Ho,·rever, the available logs of the te.s.t holes are not sufficiently accurate to define degree of cementation anC!. thickness of the cemented beds. Seism:l.c exploration

20
i n the test holes has defined a high-velocity l ayer, presumably due to calcium carbonate cement, at depths of 20 to 70 feet below the surfac e ~ and possibly another such layer at a depth of 465 feet in test hole 3 (Piper, 1952, p. 20). I nformation on cementation of valley fill below 500 feet throughout Yucca Valley is obtained from lithologic logs of
wells 3 and 7 (tables 2 and 3). The only cemented fill was penetrated
in well 7 between 579 and 632 feet below the surface. Quantitative data on physical properties of the valley fill are
limited to results of density measU+ements on 21 samples obtained at depths of 0.5 to 16 feet in trenches and pits in the Jangle area. Density of the samples .¥as determined in the field and ranged from 1.30 to 1.81, averaging 1.46 ~or 7 samples between 0.5 and 2 feet below the surface; between 2 and 16 feet, the average density is 1.65 (Piper, 1952, p. 17). The caliche has density of 2.00 to 2.05 or about 25 percent greater than the uncemented valley fill (Piper , 1952).
Results of vertical wave velocity surveys made by United Geophysical
Co., Inc., in the test holes are given in table 4. The velocities
range from 1,430 to 13,350 feet per second, indicating a wide range in chemical and physical characteristics of the valley fill to a depth of 500 feet. The high velocities are probably due to caliche layers. The average velocity increases from 2,690 feet per second in the first 15 feet of fill to 5,220 feet per second at 460 feet below the surface. The higher velocities at depth are believed to indicate more compact

and· dense rocks than near the surface. Consequently..the average density of 1. 65 for valley fill near the surface probably represent:& a minimum value for the density of the valley fill. Data a~ insufficient to approximate the density of the valley fill at depth• .
Thickness of valley fill
Thickness of the fill in Yucca Valley is known accurately at two localities, wells 3 a.nd 7 (fig. 1). Some qualitative· data. have
been obtained from the 4 test holes and seismic surveys in the
Jangle area (fig. 1). The· lithologic logs of wells ·3 and 7 indicate . that tuff was penetrated at depths of 1, 530 and 947 feet, re,speetively, below the surface (tables 2 and 3). Well 3 is about 5 miles south of well 7 and on the upthrown side of Yucca Fault. The greater thickness of valley fi~l at well 3 and results of gravity surveys (fig. 2) suggest the presence of other faults in t:,hi:s area. In the
Jangle area, the deepest test hole reached 502 feet below the, surface and did not extend through the fill. According to .Piper (1952, p. 19) the seismic refraction survey in the Jangle· area . .
indicates that the valley fill is Boo to 1,000 feet thi.'ck, thins
eastward to a few feet at the edge of the valley floor; near test hole 3,. the fill thins abruptly to about 600 feet over the crest of a buried bedro.ck "high." The fill apparently forms a thin layer not more than several feet thick along the valley margine, but ·
toward the centr~ part the fill is as much as 1,530 feet thick.

23
· However, as shown by seismic work in the Jangle area, considerable differences in thickness were found over short horizontal distances, and to ascertain accurately the thickness of the valley fill seismic surveys accompanied by drilling would be required. Several holes about 1 mile southeast of '\'Tell 7 were drilled in
1958 to a maximum depth of 550 feetj t~e holes ~rere entirely in
valley fill.
Rocks beneath valley fill
The valley fill is underlain in the vicinity of wells 3 and 7 · (fig. 1) by tuffaceous rocks that are as much ~s 270 feet thick in
I
well 3 and 1, 325 feet :thick in 1-rell 7 (tables 2 and 3) . In vicinity of Rainier Mesa the contact between the tuff and
valley fill, where exposed, has local relief of at least 100 feet. Presumably this buried surface eLlibits comparable relief in Yucca Valley. Deep drilling would be required to verify the position of this surface in critical areas.
The tuffaceous rocks that underlie the valley fill have not been penetrated completely by drill holes and their thicknesses can only be approximated. In the vicinity of :vrell 1 the contact between the lighter rocks, including valley fill and tuffaceous rocks, and the underlying dense rocks, presumably carbonates and quartzites of
Paleozoic age, has been inferred from gravity surveys. Near well 7 this contact is estimated to be at a depth of at least 3,000 feet.
This depth indicates that the tuffaceous rocks are nearly 2,000 feet

24
thick9 which is comparable to the _t:h..ickness of the Oak Spring formation on Rainier Mesao The variation in thickness of the tuffaceous rocks throughout other parts of Yucca Valley is unknown.
The contact betwee~ fill and tuffs is characterized by a gradation zone as much as 30 feet thick that contains intermixed detrital materials and weathered tuff fragments. Beneath this zone ·the tuffs are similar in compos~tion and textural features to the tuffaceous rocks that .comprise the Oak Spring formation.. In general the tv.:f'fs are tan, reddish, brown, gray, and gray-gree~ and are prr:~domina...""ltly bard, though some layers of tuff are rich in clay and are soft.
Where coring was undertaken in well 7, the tuffs were ·compacted_,
fractured, and core recovery was good. Quartz, mica, hornblende, and felsite and basalt fragments are the principal constituents ide::n.tified in the tut'fs. Predominantly the tuffs are fine to coarse grained although conglomeratic layers as much as 35 feet thick were recorded in well 3.
Structure
Yucca Fault is the major structural feature of Yucca Valleyo It is a north=trending normal fault that dips steeply eastward and has been traced along the strike from Yucca Pass northward for 20 miles (fig. 1). Vertical displacement along the fault at Yucca Pass is
estimated to be about 1,000 feet {Johnson and Hibbard, 1957, p. 376).
Recent movement on the fault is indicated in the northern part ·of Yucca Valley where uncohsolidated fill on the east is faulted agains~

25 consolidated fanglomerate on the west. A fault scarp in this area
indicates a vertical di splacement of at least 75 feet. Els e'~~ere in
Yucca Valley structural features are unknovm. but on the basis of gravity and magnet ic sur veys the rocks which form the basement of Yucca Valley are bel ieved to be structurally complex.

PRELThfiNARY RESGLTS OF TI-m GRAVITY SU1r\7EY OF YUCCA
AND FRENCHMAN VALLEYS, NEVADA
Purpose
The purpose of the gravity survey of the Nevada Test Site was to define some of the Cenozoic structural featu~es of the basin areas.
This information has two uses: 1) a knowledge of the bedrock
cor£iguration would be ve Ty· useful in the study of the ground~water movement, and 2) the gravit y data can also help define bur i ed geologi c structures that are important to the curr ent geol ogic mapping program at the Nevada Test Site.
The average density of the tuff of the Oak Spring formation of Tertiary age is similar to the average density of the alluvial fan and playa deposits (valley fill) of Quaternary age~ Therefore, in this section of the report 'Which deals wi"ch the gravity su:;". 'vey, the Tertiary and Quaternary rocks are consider ed as one Cenozoic unit, and depth to bedrock means depth to the Paleozoic formations which are assumed to underlie the tuffaceous rocks in this area.
Field methods and reduction of data
The gravity survey of the Nevada Test Site is referred to the National Base control net, the actual tie being made at McCarran Field
in Las Vegas, Nevada (Woollard, G. P., 1958).
The gravity stations on the Test Site, to date, have been
established either at u. s. Coast and Geodetic Survey 'benchmarks or

a,t points located by survey pa.rti~s from Holmes and Na.rver, Inc (J All the stations are consio.ered to haYe a. vertj~cal accuracy t>:f within one foot.
The standard corrections for free-air, Bouguer, latitude, and instrument drift have been applied to the data$ The data were reduced to sea level using a combined free-air ~Ad Bouguer correction factor of o~o6 milligal/foot1) The 0_,06 milligal/foot factor is probably low ancl the anoillP..lies as presented should be eunsi dered. as minimum values$ Terrain corrections to remove the effect of the rugged topography that surroundo Yucca e..nd Frenchman Valle:.~rs ha.7e not been made in this ~reliminary report~ This correction is less than 0. 5 milligal in the center of the va.1leys but is 1 to 4 m1.lliga.ls :near the mom1tains. In areas of high relief, such as the Rainier
Mesa area, the terrain corrections may be as high as 9 milligals.
Because most of the terrain corrections occur over the mou:'ltainCJus areas, .the gravity data for the stations in and adja.cent to the
mountains are low by approximately ·1 to 4 milligals. The terrain.
corrections would not alter the contouring appreciably but would increase the magnitude of the anomalies over the mountainous areas.
The U. Slt Geological Survey is still in the process of accumulati. ng gravity data in the area covered by this preliminary report. It is planned to complete tbe now sparse horizontal and vertical control by pla..ne -table surveying to locate sites for additional gravity stations.
Three different gravity meters, having scale constants of 0.0871,
0.2672, and 0.5391 milligals per scale division, have been used in the

28
gravity survey. The meters he.·re been cross -checked against one 8_.nother on a calibration loop and also ~oy repeat readings on given stations. Agreement between the three meters has been found to be within 0.2 milligals on repeat readings of fiel d stations.
Interpretation
In the Basin and R&~e ProvL~ce, gravity lows are associated w.i.th the Cenozoi·~ materials that fill the -oa.sin areas., This condition is true at the Nevada Test Site and the valleys are defined by gravity lo\vs. In Yucca and Frenchma."1. Valleys, valley fill overlies tuf'f'aceous rocks of the Tertiary Oak Spring formation. Because the average density of rocks of the Oak Spring formation is similar to the average density of the alluvium, both are treated as valley fill in gravity computations.
The gravity data obtained to date i n the vicinity of Yucca and Frenchman Valleys are suf'f'icient to delineate only the major strttctural
-··:""
features; the definition of all the small anomalous areas would require more gravity stations.
The gravity data are superimposed on the geologic map of Johnson and Hibbard (1957)o The Bouguer gravity map of Yucca a.nd Frenchman Valleys (fig. 2) shows an overall north-northwest trend to the regional gravityo
Perhaps the most significant anomaly .in Yucca and Frenchman Valleys is the gravity low which apparently extends from Frenchman Playa north through Yucca Valley to the ju.'rlction of Butte and Yucca

Faul.ta where the low swings to the northeast and continues into Groom L&ke (Emigrant Valley) • Between Frenchlnan and Yucca Valleys the gravity data. are not sufficient for drawing accurate contours·o However, the data from stations along the west side of the l ow indicate at least the ...155 and pos~ibly the '"'165 milliga.l contour continuea across the full distance separating the basins. On the eaat side of this low the data. susgest that the -160 and possibly the
-165 millig~ contour persists the t~l length of the low. A ~&Vity
saddle of undetermined magnitude may occur at some inte1'1neCl.iat® point bet-ween these two basins. Additional. ga:vi.ty 1tatiou1 ar~ required in this area to solve this problem.
It the continuity of this gravity low proves to be real and Frenchman, Yucca and Enigrant Valleys all lie in the s~e structur~u trough, this Url'on1ation will be very important, especially in t he · interpretation of ground-water movera.ent.
Across the soutber-fl part of Yucca Valley the gravity low parallels roughly the trace of the Yucca Fault. At the north end of tbt valley the low crosses the Yucca Fault and delineates a widened area of the . v&lley. This widened area appears to be tormed. by a down-dropped block boun~ed by the southwestward extension of Butte Fault and perhaps by the fault which lies between the Butte e..."ld Yucca Faults. These data imply an extension of the Butte Fault west to the vicinity of the Eleana Range, where it probably intersects the Quartzite Mountain anticline. The subsidiary fa.ult appears to extend into Yucca Valley at least several miles beyond the last exposed evidence.

A profile extending from north and west of Syncline Ridge to a point directly north of well 7 exhibits a gravity relief of 25 m.illigals and a vertical relief of .about 940 feet. Assuming a density contX'aSt of Oo 5 gm/cm3 bet1reen the Paleozoic bedrock and the Cenozoic tuff and valley fill, the indicated depth to bedrock at a point directly north of well 7 is at least 3,000 feet. Well 7 bottomed at 2,272 feet and was still in tuff of the Oak Spring fo~tion. If the density contrast between the Paleozoic bedrock and the vall ey fill (including the tuff} .
..

31 .
is more than 0 ~ 5 gm/cm3~the minimum depth wil l be less than indi cat ed and, conversely, if it is less.9the depths could be considerably greater.
The factor of 0.5 gm/cm3 is thought to be approximately correct for the
density contrast between these media. However, as previously mentioned, this interpretation is conservative and the depth of 3,000 feet in Yucca Valley is probably too ~-shallow>'by <50 :percent or more.
A line of gravity stations up Nye Canyon (north of Frenchman Valley)
shows a gravity relief of 26 mill igal s over a horizontal distance of 4 miles, and a difference in elevation of about 4oo feeto These data, assuming a density contrast of 0.5 gm/cm3, indicate that in Frenc!~ Valley bedrock is at least 31 6oo feet below the surface at a. point 3
miles north of the center of the playa. The gravity data show that the deeper part of the Frenchman Valley is about 2 miles north of the north edge of the present playa. surface.
Here again the depth estfmate is probably low by 50 percent or more;
changing the assumed density contrast from 0.5 to 0.4 gm/cm3 adds 1,000
feet to the indicated minimum depth of the basin.
Conclusions
This preliminary inspection of the gravity data, even though the reduction is not complete and the coverage is .not sufficient to reach definite conclusions concerning the causes of anomalies, does point out several important features about the structural geology of the Nevada Test Site.

Frenchman Valley, Yucca. Valley, a.:nd. Groom Lake (Emigrant ·vall ey) appear to lie a long the same struet-.lral trough, although the magnitude of the gra.vity low connecting Yucca and Frenchman Valley& is not known at this time.
Yucca Valley is a narrow trough whtch widens at the north endo This basin appears to be caused by down-dropped blocks bounded by the Butte Fault and the fault to the east, a11d also by the termination of an inferred bedrock ledge that extends into the valley f"r o!'l1 the ~outh .,
Rough estimates of the depth to Paleozoic bedrock in the va..lleys gi-ve minimum depths of 3,000 in Yucca. Valley and 31 6oO in Frencr.unan Valley. These values must be considered as minimum because (1) terrain corrections have not been applied to the data, and thia would add an
average of 1 to 4 milligals to the magnitude of the anomalies; (2) the assumed density contrast of 0.5 gm./cm3 between the Paleozo:i.c fornt.ations
and the Cenozoic t·llffs and alluvial material may be high; ( 3) the thickness of a rem.i -inf'inite slab is always less than the equivalent depth of a structure of finite width.
An estimation of depth to the contact between the Quaternary
alluvial valley fill and the Tertiary Oak Spring formation is not
feasible because of the closesimilarity in densities of the two materials (Diment, 1958 ; . Pakiser.? 1 •.0 · •:~ personal ·commun';'l:..cat.1.on ,). ~•

PRELIMINARY RESULTS OF AEROI'1AGNETIC SURVEY
OF PART OF 11{J'CCA VALLEY
Introduction
An aeromagnetic survey of part of Yucca Vall ey was flown in 1952. The traverses were ·flown in an approximate east-west direction, 500 feet above the groun<i, with approximately 1/4-mile flight separation. The surveyed area is bov.nded t(pproximately by latitudes 3r:03' N and 3T>O'(' N and by longitudes· 115°57' Wand 116°05' W. The area. of ·this survey is sanewha.t smaller than that of the gra.vity survey but the data are more detailed.
In the western United States, particularly in the Basin and Range province in Nevada and Californis,aeromagnetic data serve to compl ement gravity infor-mation in determining the depth and areal distribution of subsurface volcanic rocks. ·
Description and interpretation of magnetic anomalies
The aeromagnetic data and generalized g~blogy are spown in figure 3.
In the eastern part of the area small anomalies are located over tuff of the Oak Spring formation. To the west, approximately 2 miles east of Yucca Fault, a belt of positive and negative anomalies occurs. These anomalies are probably caused by lava flows buried at a shallow depth in a belt 1 mile wide paralleling the general northward geologic trend of the exposed bedrock.

34
The most sisr.J.f'ica.nt anomaly on the map is a magnetic low elongated for several miles in a north-south direction, having a IUUCUnum amplitude of 200 gammas o This feature shows excellent correlation with the Yucca F~u~t which lies approximately along the line of maximum ru&guet.ic; gradient on the east side of the anomaly. Immediately to the east of the fault is a series of positive anomalies which are probably associated with this elongat ed low. The west side of the low ex.b,ibits a g-.cadient wl:dch is less steep than that on the east side. Here the line of maximum magnetic gradient correlates well w1th the eastern edge of the · fa.ult block extending northward from Yucca Pass (figo 2) inferred from the sravity data.
This anomaly may be caused by a thin lava flow approx:i.mately 1/2 mile wide1 bounded by the Yucca Fault on the eas·c and by the edge of this fault block on the west. Interpretation of the magnetic data suggests that the flow is buried by only a few hundred feet of overlying alluv-Ium on the Yucca Fault side and is deeper to the west.
It mu.st be admitted that the general pattern of this linear anomaly is different from that of the flows farther east where the anomalies are much more irregularly distributed and display positive as well as negative amplitudes e Because of' the linear magnetic trends of the anomaly, an intrusion into the buried Paleozoic rocks seems possible. Depth estimates based. on the magnetic data near the Yucca Fault woul.d place the mass causing the anomaly at probably no more than 500 feet below the surfa,ce ~ This postulated intrusion at such a shallow depth would produce a gravity anomaly of several milligals. Although the

35
gravity data are spar se, nevertheless a gravity anomaly of seve~al milliga.ls probably wcn.:tl<l have some manifestation in the gra.vity contour map. To test this hypothesis, a detailed gravity survey in the area of t r.ds lJW,gneti c a..noma.ly is highly desirable. If this
hypothesis of int.ru.siOjJ. is l ater yerified, it would aid considerably in the understanding of t he movement of ground water in Yucca Valley.
Because of t he very useful information obtained from the aeromagnetic covera.ge of this small area., a d.di ti.onal useful i nformation could be obtained by extendi ng the survey both. t o the north and south.

present the results of this. testo The well was pumped at a constant rate
of 30 gpm for a period of 22 hourso Airline measurements of the drawdown
were made periodieallyo After pumping was stopped9 periodic measurements of water lev.el were made during a h·hour recovery periedo
- ·Measurements during the first few minutes of pumping are inacurat,e
because of the time neeessary for the airline gage to stabilize. Using techniques suggested by Ferris (1960) the data plot between tml05 minutes'
~d t=?lO mi~~es,, _ an apparent coefficient of transmissibility of h.ho
gpd per ft (gallons per day per foot) was cOJnputedo It is emphasized
-,.,
that this is only a rough approximationo A longer test would be necessary for a better estimate of the transmissibility.
- ..
The recovery curve (fig. 5) shows two fairly well=defined straight-line
se~:~ts __ whic}l _indicate apparent coefficients of transmissibility or 430 and
880 gp~__p~r._ fto Whereas the Oak Spring formation is the water-bearing unit in b\t)th.
~~1~~ --in Yucca Valley, the valley fill may be thick enough in parts ef the
valley to extend down into the zone or saturationo Well 3 penetrated more than 11 ;$'00 feet or valley fill.. It seems likely that the f'ill is even
thicker than this elsewhere in the southern part of the basino I! this is ~rue3 aquif~r characteristics of the valley !Ul would differ from those o£ the tuffo T~e - valley !ill would probably have the characteristics of s~turated granular material. The principal difference in these character= ist~e-~ i~ ~he H abi,l~~y of granular m~terial to hold more water in storageo A p~ing te~~ - ~ondueted by R. F. Brown (written communication., 195.5) on
well 5C in Frenchman Flat indicates that the coefficient of transmissi-
~~li~:r.. of ~he alluvium in that area may be between about 700 and 3£>400
gpd per rt, depending upon the interpretation of the data.

No data are available on which to base an estim.ate of the speeifi~ yield (the ratio of the volume of water which, after saturation, a roe:k will yield by gravity to':: its own volume) or coefficient of storage. The volume of the tuff that is occupied by open fractures in the Rainier Mesa area is extremely small-probably less than a tenth of a per cent and. certainly not more than a few per cent. The tuff in the subsurface of Yucca Valley is inferred to be similar in this respect. Where the lower part of the valley fill is saturated, the specific yield of this material probably would be substantially higher. Because of the i.J?.tergranular space is filled with cement, it may be appreciably less than, that (of the average valley-fill aquifer.
Possibility of hydraulic continuity between Yucca and Frenchman Valleys
The close agreement in altitude of the water table beneath Yuc ca Valley, as indicated by the water levels in 2 wells, and that beneath
Frenchman Flat, as indicated by data from 4 wells, could be due to chance,
or more ~ikely to a hydrologic connection between the 2 basins. That such a connection may exist is inferred in part from an interpretation of gravity data; _namely--that the range of hills separating the basins does not contain a "core"· of dense, relatively impermeable Paleozoic rocks
(see fig. 2). The drainage basin of Frenchman 'Ialley occupies about 450
square miles. Yucca Valley receives surface drainage from about 300 square miles. However, about 22 square miles of the Yucca Valley drainage
basin is above 6, 000 feet and thus receives greater preeipitation and has:,
a more persistent snow cove·r in winter than the Frenchman Valley drainage
basin, only 5 or 6 square miles of which is higher than 6,000 feet.

Thus9 one might expect a higher water table in Yucca Valley than im Frenchman Valley because of the inf,rred higher rechargeo
Ground-water conditions in other nearby basins may have a be~:ing on this question, inasmuch as the water table in these valleys stand mu<eh higher than in Yucca and Frenchman Valleys e Water levels in wells in Emigrant Valley indicate that the w~ter table beneath that valley is 900 feet or more higher than the water table in Yucca Valleyo In Ka:wich Valley9 northwest of Yucca Vall~, a reported depth to water indicates that the water table beneath that valley is more than 2,000 feet higher than that beneath Yucea Valley.
On the basis of the available evidence, it is ir~erred that the ground water beneath Yuqca and Frenchman Valleys is in hydrauli~ continuityo
Additional arguments can be advanced along the lines~ that i f Yucroa Valley were a tight, closed basin it would be saturated to an overflow level at its low point. The fact that, the water table i .s 1.9550 feet ©lr more deep suggests that water is l~aving the basin although not necessarily to Frenchman Valleyo
Direction and rate of movement
The area of natural recharge for Yucca and Frenchman Valleys is inferred to be the highlands that ·form the northern and western border of Yuc~a Valley; the southern part of th~ Belte<;l Range!' the Eleana Range 9 and Shoshone Mountain. The area of natural. discharge is unknowno Water-level
--da:ta -suggert Jft:OV ement t-oward -the -east, cbut ~ond -the --e-ortrines of Yucca
and .Frenchman Valleys this seems urilikely in view of the higher water levels in Indian Spring Valley (southeast of Frenchman Valley)~ at least near its

47
southern end, iri the northwestern end of Las Vegas V.alley, and i.n Enligrant V~ley. More work will be necessary to define the directi(QJ~ of m(Q)vementc.
It itt possible that some of the Paleozoic rocks,. particularly limes·t,ones,
tranStit some water. If this is trtte, the direction of movement might be to the southwest into the Amargosa Desert=-Ash Meadows...-Fortymile Carzy-oo area, and w4ter levels in these ar~as are consistent with this b.ypothes:iso
The gentle water-table gradients and- low to moderate -·perme?Qility of the water-bearing materials suggest that the ground water moves very slowly• Where fracture systems are open and well connected., the velocity migh'l~ be several times the averageo However, data are not available on which. to base a quantitative estimate.
Radioactivity of ground water
The radioactivity of water from wells 3 and 7 in YuccaVa1ley9 and
from wells 5A, 5B, and 5C in Frenchman Flat between April 1957 and
Mareh 1958 i.s given in table 6.
If one considers the great depth to saturated rock beneath Yucca and Frenchman Valleys, the distance fran the most probable souree of recharge, and the low rate of recharge from surface waters, it seems safe to assume that the radioactivity of these samples is natural. A possible except ion
is analysis 2167 from well 5B; the conditions under which this sample wa~
collected are not well known. The concentration of Alpha activity in thi~ sample is inconsistent when compared to the uranium concentration, with that of samples collected in April 1957 and March 1958o The higher con-
centration of uranium and alpha activity in samples collected from well 5A£>
compared to other samples from the Frenchman Valley well .field9 presumably

48
to the fact that well 5A is finished in Oak Spring turf, wherea$ t ,he other wells are finished in alluvium. The lithologic character of the Oak Spring formation exposed on the south side of Frenchman Valley i~ considerably different than in the vicinity of wells 3 and 7» this might
aecolll'It for the difference in radioactivity between water from well 5A
and wells 3 and 7.
