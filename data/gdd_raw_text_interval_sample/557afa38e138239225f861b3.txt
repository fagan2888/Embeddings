INTRODUCTION

This report, the last of a series of periodic reports covering investigations made by the U. S. Geological Survey on behalf of the Divisions of Raw Materials and Research of the U. S. Atomic Energy Commission, is a bibliography of Geological Survey publications stemming from the Survey's investigations of radioactive materials and deposits since 19^2. The listings, which are complete as of November 30, I960, include not only reports on investigations carried ,pn under AEC sponsorship, but those on uranium and thorium geology and related subjects financed from the Survey's direct appropriation.
The investigations reported upon in this bibliography are part of the most intensive study of any element or group of elements ever undertaken by any nation. At the outset of World War II uranium and thorium were hardly more than scientific curiosities, though their fissionable qualities had been known for many years. Uranium minerals had been used as a source material for the extraction of radium, and uranium salts were used principally as a pigment for coloring glass and chinaware. The most important use for thorium was in mantles for gas lamps. The uranium used in the first atomic bombs was acquired from foreign sources, and when the Atomic Energy Commission was created in 19^6, it was generally believed that the uranium reserves and resources of the United States were small indeed. The fact that within less than a decade the picture changed from one of apparent scarcity to one of abundant supply is an accomplishment in which the Commission, the Survey, and' the other agencies and groups that participated in the program can take justifiable pride.

From its beginning the Division ~_ Raw Materials was charged with the responsibility of finding and producing enough uranium ore within the United States to meet the rapidly increasing needs of the Nation's atomic energy program. For geologic advice and assistance the Division called upon the Survey, which previously had made studies of fissionable elements under its strategic minerals program and, during the war, for the Manhattan Engineer District. On July 1, 19^7, the Division of Raw Materials began its sponsorship of a program on the geology of uranium, thorium, and other elements of interest to the atomic energy program. This sponsorship continued until June 30, 1958. Since that time, many projects have been completed, others continued, and a number of new investigations started, all under the Survey's direct appropriation.
The program of the Division of Raw Materials was at first essentially of the "rock-in-the-box" type, aimed at discovering and mining uranium deposits of commercial size as rapidly as possible. It soon became
-* apparent to the Survey that if its uranium and thorium investigations were to produce optimum results, fundamental studies of the geology, mineralogy and geochemistry of the fissionable elements were essential. The Division of Raw Materials widened the scope of its program to include long-range geologic studies, and on July 1, 1951, the Division of Research began sponsorship of a number of basic research studies. This sponsorship continued until June 30, 1960.
Prior to 195^ security restrictions prevented the Survey from publishing many of its findings in the fissionable materials program. In 195^ t however, the major part of the Survey's geologic and related material was declassified and publication became possible. The

Proceedings of the First United Nations International Conference on the Peaceful Uses of Atomic Energy (Geneva, Switzerland, 1955) contained 6k papers by Survey authors, which were published by the Survey in 1956 as chapters in Professional Paper 300. Since that time many more reports have been published and the rate of publication has been constantly accelerated.
Since 19^7 the Survey has informed the Commission of the progress of its investigations by means of administrative reports in the Trace Elements Series. These were either Trace Elements Investigations Reports (TEI's), most of which were fairly comprehensive discussions of certain subjects or areas, or Trace Elements Memorandum Reports (TEM's), which were short papers on small areas or problems. The TEI series included periodic reports which were issued monthly and quarterly until 1952 and semiannually from 1952 through 1959. TEI and TEM reports were issued without intensive technical review and editing and are not considered formal Survey publications. Much of the material transmitted to the Commission in that form, however, was incorporated later into Survey publications in the Professional Paper, Bulletin, Circular, and the various Map series.
From 19VT through November 30, 1960, a total of 1,783 TEI and TEM reports were transmitted to the Divisions of Raw Materials and Research. Of these, 162 have been reissued by the Commission and made available to the public through the Office of Technical Services of the U. S. Department of Commerce. Among the Reports so reissued are all of the Semiannual Reports beginning with TEI -330, which covers the period December 1, 1952 to May 31, 1953. In addition to Trace Elements Reports

8
reissued by the Commission, about 160 such reports have been made available
for public inspection by release in the Survey's open files.
Formal Survey publications on the geology of fissionable materials
which are listed in this bibliography include:
23 Professional Papers, including two summary publications which are explained below.
160 Bulletins 95 Circulars 18 Geologic Quadrangle (GQ) Maps 1^5 Field Studies (MP) Maps 220 Miscellaneous Investigations (l) Maps, including 2l6 photogeologic
maps. 8 Geophysical Investigations (GP) Maps 6 Coal Investigations (C) Maps 3 Oil and Gas Investigations (OM) Maps 1 Mineral Resources (MR) Map 3 Preliminary Maps
The summary publications referred to above are Professional Paper
300, published in 1956, and Professional Paper 400-B, published in 1960.
The citation to Professional Paper 300 is:
Page, L. R., Stocking, H. E. (AEC), and Smith, H. B., 1956, Contributions to the geology of uranium and thorium by the U. S. Geological Survey and Atomic Energy Commission 'for the United Nations International Conference on the Peaceful Uses of Atomic Energy, Geneva, Switzerland, 1955.
In this bibliography, for the sake of brevity, the complete citation is
not given for the chapters in Professional Paper 300; instead they are
cited as "Professional Paper 300", followed by the page numbers, the
names of the authors, the date, and the titles of the chapters. The
same procedure is followed in citing chapters in Professional Paper
ltf)0-B, the citation to which is:
Geological Survey Research I960: Short papers in the geological sciences.
In some sections of this bibliography two or more publications
bearing the same, or essentially the same, title are listed. In such

cases one of the citations is usually to a Circular or to a chapter in
Professional Paper 300. 0?he reason for this apparent duplication is that
prior to 1955 many Circulars were issued to make certain information
available rapidly, and the material in them was later e^cpanded for publi-
cation in the Professional Paper or Bulletin series. Most of the chapters
in Professional Paper 300 are summaries, prepared for the Geneva Conference,
of larger and more comprehensive reports that were in preparation when
the Conference was held.
In addition to the reports published by the Survey itself and listed
in this volume, Survey authors have published a total of 228 abstracts
and 368 full-length papers stemming from the uranium program in scientific
journals devoted to different phases of the earth sciences. These journal
papers, like the Survey's own publications, have contributed substantially
to the knowledge of uranium geology.
Entries in this bibliography are arranged under the following main
headings:
General publications on uranium and thorium Reconnaissance for uranium and thorium Uranium in sandstone-type deposits Uranium in carbonaceous materials Uranium in phosphates Uranium in limestones Investigations of thorium and related elements Beryllium investigations
Each publication is listed under the category of its major interest.
As examples, publications on such subjects as geophysics, mineralogy or
geochemistry, if of a general nature or applicable to the Nation or a
large part thereof, are listed under "General Publications", whereas
those on areas in the Colorado Plateau are cited under "Uranium in
sandstone-type deposits". Similarly, a large number of publications

10
stemming from the reconnaissance program describe uranium occurrences or deposits in specific environmentsj these are listed tinder the rock type in which they occur, rather than under the general "Reconnaissance" heading. Admittedly, some reports fall into a gray zone between the general and specific categories, but these are relatively few in number and a minimum of arbitrary decisions as to the proper grouping have been necessary.

RECONNAISSANCE FOR URANIUM AND THORIUM
The Geological Survey began a reconnaissance search for strategic minerals in the late 1930*s. In 19kk the investigations were largely reoriented toward the so-called "trace elements", particularly uranium and thorium, and some support was received from the Manhattan Engineer District. Ground reconnaissance in the conterminous United States and Alaska, on behalf of the Atomic Energy Commission, began in 19^7 and continued until 1955- Ground reconnaissance was augmented by airborne radioactivity reconnaissance that began on a small scale in 19^8; this phase of the program continued until 1956.
One of the most useful products of the reconnaissance program, from a long-range standpoint, has been the development and refinement of scientific methods of prospecting for fissionable and other elements
Prospecting methods
Prospecting for uranium and thorium poses some unusual problems, not the least of which is that many uranium- and thorium-bearing minerals cannot be identified visually, but must be located by measurements of their radioactivity. Accordingly early investigations depended largely on Geiger counters, either hand-carried, carborne, or airborne. In recent years considerable progress has been made in the development of geochemical, mineralogical, hydrogeological, and other methods of finding both uranium ore and environments favorable for the concentration of ore.

Reconnaissance investigations
As much of the data obtained during the Survey's reconnaissance
for uranium and thorium was of ephemeral interest, only the more
important investigations and deposits have been reported upon in formal
Survey publications. A very large number of such reports, however,
were transmitted to the AEC as Trace Elements Reports, and each of the
Semiannual Reports contains a summary of reconnaissance activities
during the period covered.

URANIUM IN SA1TOSTONE-TYPE DEPOSITS Colorado Plateau regioa
In the Colorado Plateau region the Survey's first geologic investigations on behalf of the Division of Raw Materials began in 19^7 5 these were studies of specific areas prerequisite to an exploratory drilling program. As the program developed, increasing attention was devoted to longer-range scientific studies of the entire region as well as to detailed geologic investigations of important areas within the region. The investigations included geologic quadrangle mapping, photogeologic mapping, stratigraphic studies, geobotanical studies, regional and district geophysical studies, and investigations of the mineralogy and geochemistry of the Plateau ores. Survey reports stemming from the Colorado Plateau program published through November
30, 1960 are listed below.

limited to the Morrison formation, from which most of the early
production of uranium ore was taken. Later the investigations were
extended to include most of the sedimentary formations in the region.

Studies of photogeologic mapping techniques
In addition to 18 maps of Ti-minute quadrangles in the Geologic
Quadrangle (GQ) Map series and 89 preliminary geologic maps in the Field Studies (MF) Map series stemming from its Colorado Plateau
investigations, the Survey has published 216 photogeologic maps in the Miscellaneous Investigations (I) series. These maps were prepared from aerial photographs of areas in Utah and Arizona for which little or no
topographic coverage was available. Because of the conditions under
which they were prepared, the maps vary considerably in the amount of *
detail shown, but they served a most useful purpose as guides to prospecting and as bases for geologic studies during the early years of the Colorado Plateau investigations; many of them are still of value
as preliminary geologic maps. An outstanding achievement of the photogeologic mapping program
from the long-range standpoint has been the development of vastly improved techniques and procedures for interpreting geology from aerial photographs. Survey publications on photogeologic methods are: Bulletin 1C&3-A; Ray, R. G., 1955, Photogeologic procedures in geologic

Western San Juan Mountains 9 Colorado
The area studied by the Survey's Western San Juan Mountains project
is at the eastern edge of the Colorado Plateau and extends into the
mountains themselves. Most of the Survey's investigations were of the
Plateau-type deposits in sandstones. Reports on studies in the area are:

San Juan County, Utah
San Juan County, Utah, which lies east of the Colorado River and south of 38 30' north latitude, contains a number of uranium mining districts. Among these are Lisbon Valley, La Sal Creek, Sage Plain,
Abajo Mountains, Elk Ridge, White Canyon, Red House Cliffs and Clay Hills north of the San Juan River, and Monument Valley south of that stream.
In 19^7 little geologic information on San Juan County was available and accordingly much of the Survey's effort in that area was devoted to geologic mapping. As no topographic maps were published until 1952, much of the early mapping was done by photogeologic methods. A total of 29 preliminary geologic maps and 71 photogeologic maps of 7^-minute quadrangles
wholly or mostly within San Juan County have been published at a scale of l:2l|.,000.

Arizona
The Survey's uranium investigations in the Arizona portion of the
Colorado Plateau were carried on in three principal areas; the Paria
and Kaibab plateaus in Coconino and Mohave Counties, west and north of
the Colorado River; Monument Valley in Navajo County; and the Carrizo
Mountains in Apache County, in the northeastern corner of the state and
extending into New Mexico. Sixteen preliminary geologic maps of 74-minute
quadrangles in the area have been published at a scale of 1:2k,000; of
this total, four quadrangles are in the Paria and Kaibab plateau areas
and 12 are in Monument Valley. Also, 23 photogeologic maps of 7i-minute
quadrangles in the Paria and Kaibab plateau areas have been published
at a scale of 1:2k,000.

New Mexico

As a producer of uranium the New Mexico portion of the Colorado

Plateau developed later than other parts of the Colorado Plateau, and

the Survey did little work in the region, other than that of a recon-

naissance nature, until about 1955- Investigations begun under the

sponsorship of the Division of Raw Materials are continuing under the

Survey's direct appropriation. Survey publications on the region are:

The Survey's uranium program in the Black Hills followed its

59
investigations of beryllium in that area. The first uranium studies
were in the Southern Black Hills, largely in Fall River and Ouster
Counties, South Dakota, where carnotite was discovered in 1952.

URANIUM IN VEINS, IGNEOUS ROCKS, AND RELATED DEPOSITS
Early in the search for uranium deposits it was thought that large vein-type deposits might be found in the United States, and areas in which such deposits might be expected to occur were investigated under the sponsorship of the Division of Raw Materials. The results of these investigations, though somewhat disappointing from an immediate economic standpoint, are of great scientific interest and value. In 1952 the Division of Research began sponsorship of a long-range study of the distribution of uranium in igneous rocks, which has provided a great deal of basic data on the emplacement of the element in rocks of that type.

URANIUM IN CARBONACEOUS J&TERIALS
In 19^7, when the Survey's program on behalf of the Divison of
Raw Materials was started, it was thought that black shales migjat be
an important source of uranium for some contain vast quantities of
the element, although in very low concentrations. Reconnaissance of
t he black shales of the tfoited States and more detailed studies of the
Chattanooga shale of eastern Tennessee were therefore important parts
of the program in its earlier stages. Later, following extensive
reconnaissance studies, the uraniferous lignites of North and South
Dakota were investigated, as were also asphalts and petroleum.

URANIUM IN PHOSPHATE
In 19^7 the bulk of the known uranium in the United States was in black shales and phosphates. The latter appeared to be the most likely source of the metal, as phosphate was being mined extensively for fertilizer; it was thought that uranium might be recovered as a by-product at existing mines and mills. The Survey's investigations covered both the phosphate fields in the southeastern United States and those in the Phosphoria formation of Wyoming and adjacent states.
Southeast phosphate
Early reconnaissance showed that the phosphate fields of Middle Tennessee were too low in uranium content to justify further investigations, and that the abandoned fields near Charleston, South Carolina were too small to be of interest. Investigations therefore were concentrated on the fields in the Bone Valley formation in central Florida, although some of the studies extended into northern Florida and Georgia. Survey publications on the southeastern phosphate fields are:

Phosphoria formation
The most extensive phosphate deposits in the United States are in
the Phosphoria formation of Permian age which crops out in Idaho,
Montana, Wyoming and Utah. Strategic Minerals investigations by the
Survey in 1938 discovered that some beds in the formation were high in
vanadium, and later it was found that some of the vanadiferous beds
contained small amounts of uranium. Further studies, supported in
part by the Missouri River Basin Committee of the Department of the
Interior and in part by AEG, were started in 19^7 to investigate the
formation as a source not only of phosphate, but of vanadium, uranium,
zinc, and molybdenum.
Survey publications on its investigations of the Phosphoria
formation are:

BTVESTIGAIHOTS OF THORIUM AND RELAM) DEPOSITS
Investigations of monazite as a source of thorium were included
in the program of the Division of Raw Materials in 19^7 > 19W, and
191*9, but were then recessed until 1952. Studies of thorium were
resumed on a small scale in 1952 and continued through 1955. In 1956
the Division of Research "began sponsorship of a comprehensive study of
the geology and geochemistry of thorium, which is of particular interest
in view of the recent renewed interest in thorium as a source material.

BERYLLIUM INVESTIGATIONS
Prior to 19^7 the Survey investigated pegraatitic and non-pegraatitic
deposits of beryllium as part of its Strategic Minerals studies. The
program was continued under the sponsorship of the Division of Raw
Materials from 19*1-7 through 1950, when field work was completed. Survey
