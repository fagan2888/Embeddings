zincite. A little calamine (hydrous silicate of zinc) is found in most of the mines. Experimental work has shown that anhydrous zinc carbonate tends to form where there is abundant excess of carbonic acid, and hydrous zinc carbonate where there is a deficiency of carbonic acid. The distribution of these two minerals in this district conforms with the conclusions of experinlental work.
Although galena is widespread, probably n1ost of the lead in the deposits is present as cerusite (lead carbonate); s01ne anglesite (sulphate of .lead) is found in n1ost of the mines. The simple vanadate of lead, vanadinite, was recognized at only one mine, but small quantities of the mixed vanadates of lead, zinc, and copper are widespread.
Structural rela(ions of the ore deposits.-The broad form of most of the deposits of the district, especially of the larger deposits, is distinctly tabular, although here and there some of the smaller bodies have simple or complex rounded forms. Most of these tabular forms lie nearly if not quite parallel to the bedding; a s1naller nun1ber cut the bedding obliquely. The conclusion n1ay be broadly stated that the deposits lie along fractures that have broken the beds, especially the massive beds of limestone. In several places the fractures that lie nearly parallel to tlie bedding have been interpreted as thrust faults which are slightly older than the fractures that cross the bedding. It seems here that the solutions bearing the sulphides of the 1netals have risen along the crosscutting fractures
3387-31--2

and spread out in the breccia zones along the earlier thrust faults. Probably this explanation applies to other deposits where the evidence is more obscure. The largest ore deposits have been found in the fractures and breccia zones that trend nearly parallel to the bedding. Two large ore deposits, those of the Potosi and Bonanza mines, lie in conical or domal breccia zones, where they are cut by later, nearly vertical fractures.
Many ore bodies in the district, especially in the southern part, are broken by minor postmineral faults, but the extent of these is not great.
Genes.is of the ·01·es.-In this district a thick section of limestone beds has been folded, broken by several1najor and numerous minor thrust faults, and then intruded by dikes and sills of a granUlar silicic igneous rock. After more minor thrust faulting and minor normal faulting, metalliferous sulphides and gold were deposited in breccia zones and fractures. In a broad way the gold deposits lie in fractures in or near the intrusive rock, the copper deposits are n1ore remote from the intrusive bodies, and the zinc and lead deposits are most remote. Apart from a crude zonal distribution· outward from the intrusive bodies, the presence of a little copper in both the gold deposits and the zinc and· lead deposits tends t~ link them in a common origin. It is possible, though not certain, that a deeply buried ma~s of igneous rock was the actual source of the metals, and it seems probable that such a body caused the ascent and dispersal of the metals.

INTRODUCTION
FIELD WORK AND. ACKNOWLEDGMENTS
. The field work on which this report is based was begun October 15, 1921, and continued until May 13, 1922. Charles H. Behre served effectively as a field n.ssistnnt until April 1, 1922. Several of the mines were revisited by the writer in November and Decernber, 1924, and December, 1926. Assistance was freely given by the Yellow Pine Mining Co. (J. F. Kent, president), Sultan Mining Co. (Henry Robbins, owner), Goodsprings Anchor Mining Co. (Seeley W. Mudd, vice president), Boss Mining Co. (S. E. Yount), Empire Zinc Co., Goodsprings Mining Co. (Alonzo Z. Hyde), J. R. Newberry (Tam o' Shanter mine), Neva.da-l(eystone Mining Co. (T. A. Johnson), S. E. Root,. J. W. !\1cFa~tridge (Azurite mine), and S. S. Arentz (Ingomar mine). Without exception the residents of Goodsprings as well as the watchmen at the mines cordially gave all a~sistance necessary from time to time in the areal work and the examination of mines. Special mention should be made of John · Fredrickson, John Egger, Harvey Hardy, A. J. Robbins, R. Munzeberg, Fred Piehl, George Meacham, C. W. Price, A. 0. Jacobsen, A. Munzbrook, George L ..

GEOGRAPHY
LOCATION OF THE AREA
The Goodsprings quadrangle lies in the extreme southern part of Nevada, in ·the angle of Clark County that is bounded on the east by the Colorado River and on the west by the State line. (See fig. 1 and pl. 3.) The width of the quadrangle is 10.25 miles and the length 21.9 miles, so that the area is 224.5 square miles. Of this area 12.4 square miles in the southwest corner lies in the State of California.
The ,district is accessible from Jean, on the Los Angele~ & Salt Lake branch of the Union Pacific Railroad, which lies in 8 miles southeast of Goodsprings, the principal settlement in the quadrangle. This railroad was built in 1905, and previously the district was accessible from Ivanpah, Calif., 34 miles south of Jean, and the terminal of a branch line of the Atchison, Topeka & Santa Fe Railway. The Arrowhead automobile highway between Ba;rstow, Calif., and Las Vegas, Nev., passes through Jean. At an earlier period the district was reached from the Spanish trail between Los 'Angeles and Salt Lake City, which crosses the Spring Mountains 2 miles north of Potosi Mountain. The ore produced by the Yellow Pine mine is shipped to Jean, and the heavy supplies for that mine are brought into the district over a narrow-gage railway built in 1910 by the Yellow Pine Mining Co.
SURFACE FEATURES
The Goodsprings quadrangle covers the southern third of--the· $pring Mountains-a range which is, in

several ways, one of the most unusual and interesting in southern Nevada. Unlike the near-by ranges, which trend generally north, this range forms a broad arc convex to the northeast. It is clearly defined for 70 miles, extending from the Amargosa· Desert on the northwest to State Line Pass on the southeast. The greatest width is about 24 miles, at the place where it culminates in Charleston Peak, 11,910 feet above sea level. Although there are several slightly higher peaks in Nevada (such as Boundary Peak, Esmeralda County, 13,145 feet, and Wheeler Peak, White Pine County, 13,047 feet), it is interesting that one of the ·highest peaks in the State lies adjacent to the lowest valley, Las Vegas, scarcely 1,600 feet above _sea level. The rugged mountain mass of which Charleston Peak is the highest point rises abruptly from the· valley, and the two extremes of surface features are presented in striking contrast. The clJmate and therefore the plant life reflect this con.trast. There is a heavy snowfall on the peak, some of which survives the summer, and there are .Jarge areas of a vigorous growth of pine trees. By contrast, snow is very uncommon in Las Vegas Valley and many semitropical plants thrive.
The southern part of the Spring Mountains presents a similar contrast to the near-by valleys but in less degree. This part of the range trends neariy north, is very irregular in outline, and 4 to 6 miles wide. The highest point in the Goodsprings quadrangle is Potosi Mountain (Olcott Peak), 8,504 feet, in the northern part; the lowest altitude is at Mesquite Dry Lake, in the southwest corner, about 2,545 f~et. The surface features of these two parts of the regwn stand in striking contrast. Viewed froin the southwest or south along gently rising ridges, Potosi Mountain is not particularly impressive, but viewed from northwest, east, or southeast (pls. 4, A; 13, A), the northeast face presents an impressive escarpment that can be ascended only with difficulty. The sum~it and northeast slopes are well covered with pinon and cedar, 15 to 25 feet high, and there are sporadic groves of spruce on the north side. This hig:h area receives a heavy snowfall, and drifts survive locally into the early summer. By contrast, the flat valleys have only a sparse growth of desert shrubs, and their lowest par_ts are utterly bare. Thus, the lowest part of Mesquite Dry Lake is devoid of vegetation and is covered with a veneer of gypsum crystals and salt. The bordering zone contains sparse groves of mesquite trees, but the most abundant shrub is creosote bush (Oovillea tridentata). In Goodsprings Valley and the border of I vanpah Valley this is the commonest shrub up to an altitude of about 4,250 feet, and mesquite trees are unknown. There are few other shrubs in the valleys except greasewood (Atriplex canescens) and several varieties of yucca.
The areas containing abundant creosote bush n1erge with a higher zone in which a s1nall shrub, coleogyne

In March, 1922, the flow was estimated at 75 gallons· an hour, or 40 barrels a day. Although the water appe~rs in wash that covers bedrock: probably its local appearance is largely determined by the Keystone thrust fault, which lies near by.

Rose Tank lies along the Potosi-Arden road in the E. ~ sec. 26, T. 22 S., R. 58 E. In 1922 water was piped to the tank from a seep 8,000 feet to the northwest, at the base of the sandstone cliffs. The cliffs· above the t·alus are cut by a group of fractures of.

In April, 1922, the discharge was estimated at 1 gallon a minute, or about 35 barrels. a day. When the Ninety-nine· nrine was operating, a pipe line 9,000 feet long was installed, but this has fallen into disuse. The water is clear and tasteless.

There is a spring in theW. ~ sec. 24, T. 23 S., R. 58 E., that has been improved by a tank to supply water to cattle. A tunnel is driven about 50 feet in the wash to bedrock, the Moenkopi ·formation, and a mud dam impounds the water that accumulates. It is then piped to the tank.· In October, 192l, the flow was estimated at 1~ gallo·ns an hour, lnitin November, 1924, it was even less. The water was clear and tasteless. The Cottonwood fault passes close to 'the tunnel and probably aids in accu!nulating water at this place.

The wash is localized in the ravine for a distance of 200 feet near the place where thin limestones of the Bird Spring formation turn sharply from N. 70° W. to N. 40° W. No conspicuous faults or fractures were noted near by. A few hundred feet below the spring, where the water cascades over beds of limestone, the estimated discharge was 7~ gallons an hour (March, 1922).
Keystone Spring lies on the west side of a ravine in the S. ~sec. 6, T. 24 S., R. 58 E. A cave 6 by 10 feet has been -dug in· the wash, and water accumulates on the bottom in a pqol 5 feet in diameter and 1 foot deep.

WATER SUPPLY

In tlanuary, 1922, the discharge was estimated at 10 Wells in Goodsp'rings quadrangle, Nevada, and condition of

galJons an hour. The near-by rocks, which strike

water in April, 1922

north and dip west, are shaly a.nd sandy dolomite of the lower part of the Bird Spring formation. They are nnlCh broken, and a part of the Wilson thrust fault lies only a few feet east of the spring. The water is colorless and almost tasteless. .
A review of the conditions under which these springs occur indicates that all except one are disposed around the border of the higher tim her-covered part of the range, which doubtles~ receives the greatest rainfall in the region. No formation is particularly favored, but all the springs except one, Mexican Spring, lie close to conspicuous faults or fracture zone.s which lead toward the timber-covered areas.
Wells.-Water occurs in two areas elsewhere in the quadrangle where it may be obtained by sinking shallow wells. The larger of these areas is that on which the townsite of Goodsprings is located. The other area roughly coincides with Mesquite Valley, only a small part of which is included in this quadrangle. Mesquite Valley includes many square miles within which water of good quality 1p.ay be obtained from 5 to 45 feet below the surface,6 but only meager use has been made of it thus far.
As the water supply at Goodsprings is essential to the operation of the near-by n1ines, a special study

FIGURE 3.-Map showing location of fossil collections

In some of the mines, such as the Keystone, Aljce, and. Lavina, the water is clearly due to the presence of dikes or sills of porphyry. This rock, which lacks bedding, is much less pervious to water than the limestones, and the water struck in the mines undoubtedly represents local pockets rather than the permanent water table. It is not possible to state with confidence the depth at which the permanent water table may be struck from place to place throughout the district. It would probably not be as deep as the water in the near-by alluvial valleys, Mesquite and Pahrump, at the lowest points of which it stands about 2,500 feet above sea level.7 Probably most of the mines will encounter little water above an altitude of 3,500 feet, and some may not strike much above 3,000 feet.

GEOLOGY
AGE AND CHARACTER OF THE ROCKS
The rocks exposed at the surface of this quadrangle include. a wide variety of consolidated sedi1nents, as well as intrusive igneous rocks and surface lavas. They range in age fron1 Ca1nbrian to Recent, but a: few Iniles to the southeast the oldest rocks of this area .are underlain by still earlier sediments, and these in turn rest upon crystalline granite and schist.
The section .of stratified rocks has an aggregate thickness of about 13,000 feet, of which li1nestone and <;lolon1ite n1ake ·up slightly nwre than 7,000 feet, largely confined to the lower half. The upper half is largely sandstone, shale, and congl01nerate~ Fossils are unconunon in the lower 3,000 feet of beds, but those found, with the aid of knowledge fron1 hear-by regions to the east, serve to determine the age of the beds. In the overlyill.g 4,000 feet of li1nestone .fossils are rather comnwn, locally even abundant, and serve to deterJnine the age of successive groups with confidence.

In the upper 6,000 feet of the section fossils have been found only in the lower 1,200 feet, and correlation of the overlying beds is based on similarity of lithology. Only two unconformities have been recognized, that at the base of the Pennsylvanian Yellowpine formation and that at the base of the Triassic Moenkopi formation, but there 1nay be others in the higher sandstones and conglomerates.
The igneous rocks fall readily into two groups-an earlY. group of two varieties of coarsely crysta.lline intrusive rocks and a later group c01nprising several varieties. of fine-grained surface flows and s1nall intrusive tnasses. The early group is represented by several sills and dikes in the central part of the district that are probably related to large masses of similar intrusive rocks 25 miles or more farther south. They presumably did not reach the surface at the tin1e of intrusion. The later group includes the products of several isolated volcanic vents and is confined to the southern half of the quadrangle.

As the field work progressed and it was found that almost all the rocks of the Paleozoic and lower Mesozoic section are limestones and dolomites, it became desirable to distinguish between them constantly and to record their distribution carefully. With this end in view, hydrochloric acid was used in the field to distinguish between limestone, magnesian lirnestone, und dolomite. In the descriptions of the rocks the attempt has been made to use the terms with discrimination.
In describing the texture of the carbonate rocks, it will serve a purpose to assign definite limits to common descriptive terms. Most of the limestone of the region breaks witp a conchoidal fracture, and the texture is that of porcelain. Except for a few crystalline crinoid stems, no individual grains can be seen with a hand lens. In a few limestones and most dolomites the entire groundmass is distinctly crystalline, and light is reflected from many cleavage facets. Where the average grain is less than 0.25 millimeter the rock is called finely crystalline; 0.25 to 1 millimeter, medium crystalline; above 1 millimeter, coarsely crystalline.

UNEXPOSED ROCKS
ARCHEAN SYSTEM
GRANITE GNEISS
The oldest rocks that crop out in the Goodsprings quadrangle are the thin-bedded dolomites near the base of the Goodsprings formation, exposed near the Potosi and Keystone mines. During the progress of the survey of the Ivanpah quadrangle in October, 1924, the base of the local Paleozoic section was found at the .south end of Sheep Mountain, east of Jean, in sec. 32, T. 25 S., R. 60 E. Here hard dark-brown sandstone (Tapeats sandstone) rests on reddish granite gneiss, which crops out widely farther south in the McCullough Range and the parallel range farther west. The gneiss is a distinctive rock, about half its volume being composed of sirnple flat crystals of pale-reddish orthoclase, 1 to 2 inches long and as much as an inch wide. These crystals have persistent parallel orientation in a matrix that consists largel.Y of dark biotite. Sufficient is known of the region to

UPPER CAMBRIAN TO DEVONIAN (?) ROCKS

state with confidence that this is part of the Archean rocks that crop out widely in southeastern California and western Arizona.8 Doubtless this gneiss, possibly overlain by Algonkian sediments in the western part of the quadrangle, underlies the Paleozoic section in the Goodsprings quadrangle.

ALGONKIAN SYSTEM
No rocks that belong to the Algonkian system crop out in the quadrangle, but it may be helpful in considering some stratigraphic and structural problems to record the discovery of 3,500 feet of couglo1nerate, quartzite, and dolomite, with intrusive sills, on the north slope of the ICingston Mountains, 25 miles west of the Spring 1viountains, which doubtless belong to this system. Probably none of these rocks underlie the Spring lV[ountains, but they may be locally present beneath the Paleozoic rocks of the western part of the Goodsprings quadrangle.

CAMBIUAN SYSTEM
TAPEATS SANDSTONE AND BRIGliT ANGEL SHALE
The oldest rocks that crop out in the quadrangle are beds of dolomite near the base of the Goodsprings formation. It may aid the consideration of so1ne structural problents to record here the beds that lie between that fonnation and the underlying granite . gneiss outside the quadrangle, at the south end of Sheep Mountain, east of Jean, 'in sec. 32, T. 25 S., R. 60 E. Similar but thicker beds crop out in the ranges west of Mesquite Valley, and there can be 1\ttle doubt that they underlie the Spring Mountains.

The fossil collections from this locality have been examined by Edwin Kirk, of the United States Geological Survey, who reports the following deternlinations:
Collection 2a, from basal sandstone: Billingsella coloradoensis (Shumard), trilobite fragments. Collection 2b: Annelid burrows and trails. Collection 2c: Fucoids. c'ollection 2d: Probably inorganic material. The basal lot is Upper Cambrian; I think you may assume that you are dealing with Bright Angel shale.
L. F. Noble, who has studied these formations in the Grand Canyon region,9 was able to visit· the Sheep Mountain locality and confirm the impression that, even though lacking the san1e species of fossils, the section presented above contains the sa1ne lithologic units as those that make up the formations in the Grand Canyon area, in a sin1ilar succession and of similar thickness. In both areas the beds were laid down on a surface of low relief, and the thickness of the lower sandstones differs from place to place in accordance with that relief. The overlying dolomites in the Sheep Mountain area present the 1nottled appearance characteristic of so1ne of the beds of the Muav limestone, of Upper Cambrian age. Probably the beds that 1nake up this stratigraphic unit in the Grand Canyon are the equivalent of beds in the lower part of the Goodsprings dolomite in southern Nevada.

AREAL DISTRIBUTION·
The rocks here named Sultan limestone are widely distributed throughout the Goodsprings quadrangle, but as they are much thinner than the underlying Goodsprings dolomite the area of the outcrops is much smaller. The best exposed and most persistept belt extends from the northern border around the west side of the Spring Mountains to the vicinity of the Boss mine, where it is interrupted by faulting. East of the faulted area it extends eastward across the range and southward along the east front, although it is repeatedly interrupted by faults. There are· a.lso extensive exposures north and west of Potosi Mountain, northwest and southwest of ·Little Devi). Peak, and in a small area west of the Lavina mine. The name is derived from the Sultan mine, in the neighborhood of which the exposures are very good.

"Detailed section recorded below.

IRONSIDE DOLOMITE MEMBER
Lithology.-The beds here designated Ironside dolomite member of the Sultan limestone consist of nearly black limestone that has been altered to dolomite throughout the quadrangle, except in several small areas, notably in theW. %·sec. 29, T. 25 S., R. 58 E. The name is derived from the Ironside mine, a mile north of the Boss mine, on the west side of the range, near which it is well exposed. Although the individual beds range from 2 to .5 feet in thickness, they are commonly inconspicuous and in the south half. of the quadrq,ng1e form a rather massive unit 50 to 125 feet thick, sharply separated from the overlying and underlying beds. This unit is conspicuous from Columbia Pass westward 5 miles to the Boss rnine. In this portion of the· area a larg~ part of the member is darkgray dolomite of porcelainlike texture, locally tmiformly mottled by lighter, more coarsely crystalline areas 1 to 2 inches in diameter. In the north half of the quadrangle the limiting surfaces are locally indistinct and mottling is uncommon, but there is a dark zone of dolomite that contains distinctive fossils. It is noteworthy that dolomitization has produced little change in color or texture.
Fossils.-Although the dolomite contains· but few fossils (seep. 16), they can be found with close search at most exposures. The Stromatopora are dark masses of chert that somewhat resemble heads of cauliflower 2 to 4 inches in diameter and in some localities are abunda.nt. In the zones where they occur other masses of chert are present, but with this exception chert is rather uncommon in the unit.
VALENTINE LIMESTONE MEMBER
Lithology.-The nliddle part of the Sultan limestone, here named Valentine lim~stone member, is made up of several types of beds that are distinctive by contrast with the Ironside dolomite below and the Crystal Pass limestone above. The name is derived from the Valentine mine, in sec. 23, T. 25 S., R. 58 E., east of which the limestone is well .exposed. As originally

deposited, n10st of the beds were pure limestone; at present many of the beds are largely altered to dolomite. Thin layers of shale are undoubtedly present, but they are obscure. The only coarse sediment in the Sultan limestone is a lens of brownish sandstone or quartzite 5 feet thick near the middle of the Valentine n1en1ber, which crops out for a distance of several miles near the Mountain Springs, in sees. 18 and 19, T. 22 S., R. 58 E., and east of the Ingomar mine, in
the NW. % sec. 4, T. 25 S., R. 58 E. At the latter
locality, in the rnidst of characteristic beds oflimestone, there is a lens of cross-bedded sandstone 3 feet thick and 25 feet long. The coarsest grains of quartz range from 0.5 to 1 millimeter in dian1eter and are well rounded.

Pn.rtial dolomitization is very well shown in the hills west of the Boss n1ine camp and near Crystal Pn.ss. In the northwest quarter of the quadrangle massive beds of limestone make up a smaller part of the n1en1ber and the layers of platy limestone are 1nore conunon a.nd thicker.

Pr01n the region where this section was n1easured northward to the border of the quadrangle platy Jinlestone is progressively 1nore abundant, and near the Mountain Springs it makes up a large part of the me1nber.
There is little chert in this n1e1nber, but in smne places, genern.lly in the upper half, there are one or locally two beds of dolonutized n1assive limestone 5 to 15 feet thich:: that contain abundant small cherty masses. These masses are a qua.rter of an inch to
1X inches in diameter, irregularly rounded, much
resen1bling small cauliflower heads, and uniforn1ly distributed throughout. the thickness of the bed. At first the chert masses appeared to be organic ren1ains, but after observation over a lftrge area this interpretation was abandoned. Such beds do not appear to be parts of one continuous bed but local lenses at different horizons. One bed 9rops out below the workings of the Colun1bia mine and can be traced westward n~
fn.r as ICirby vVash. Others crop out high on the ridge
west of the Potosi nune and along the tramroad from the Potosi mine nnd the head of the aerial tramway.
CHYS'l'AI~ l'ASS LIMESTONE MEMBER
L·ithology.-Between the n1assive limestones that con tai.n Devonian fossils an·d somewhat similar higher beds that yield the lowest Mississippian fossils there is a zone of lin1estone 150 to 260 feet th.ick that is uncon11nonly homogeneous throughout the region and lacks any t.ra.ces of fossils or chert. This limestone

forn1s the top n1en1ber of the Sultan limestone and is here named Crystal Pass limestone member, from Crystal Pass, in sec. 2, T. 25 S., R. 58 E. It is made up of light bluish gray limestone of porcelainlike texture. Weathered surfaces yield many flat plates, cmnmonly half an inch to 2 inches thick, and fresh fractures show similar lamination. (See pl. 5, B.) The limestone is identical in appearance with the thinner beds that occur in the underlying Valentine limestone member. Here and there massive beds appea.r, but they are uncommon. On flat slopes the outcrops are broadly rounded and yjeld considerable angular debris, but on steep slopes and cliffs, as along the northeast face of Potosi Mountain, where it is protected by h.igher massjve beds, it forms a single massive bed, homogeneous in color, texture, and lamination throughout. Considered as a un.it it is the most persistent in the entire region and therefore forms a valuable stratigraph.ic horizon.
In contrast with the other limestone masses in the Devon.ian and Mississippian formations, the CrystaJ Pass limestone is less susceptible to alteration to dolomite than any other. In several localities, as near Crystal Pass, where the overlying and underlying beds are completely altered to dolomite, it shows only sporadic patches. (See pl. 17, 0.) In the region from Kirby Wash eastward to the front of the range, however, where the underlying and overlying beds are con1pletely converted to dolomite, the Crystal Pass limestone is also completely altered.
No analyses have been made of specimens of limestone collected from the Sultan formation. Field tests indicate tliat all the material was originally very pure limestone. A lens of Crystal Pass limestone exposed in the hill at Sloan, 15 miles northeast of Goodspring, has survived the process of dolomitization, which has affected the near-by beds, and is mined by the Nevada Lime & Rock Co. as a source of limestone. Large quantities are mined annually that range from 97.5 to 98.5 per cent calciun1 carbonate. The lime is used in sugar refining.
AGE AND CORRELATION OF SULTAN LIMESTONE
On the basis of his identifications of the fossils from the Sultan limestone Edwin Kirk writes:
The fauna is correlative with that of a horizon in the upper part of the Nevada limestone of the Eureka district and with the Martin limestone of Arizona. This statement certainly holds as regards the faunas above the Ir.onside dolomite. The fauna collected from the Ironside dolomite is too meager definitely to establish its exact equivalence.
Some uncertainty exists as to the exact age assignment of this fauna. Williams 14 considered the fauna to be of Middle Devonian age. Apparently equivalent beds in Iowa have variously been assigned to the Upper and Middle Devonian. Until such time as a definite age assignment of the fauna is made in the well-known Iowa section, it seems inadvisable definitely to place the fauna in the West, where neither its relat~on to

MONTE CRISTO LIMESTONE
AUEAL DIS1'UIBUTIO~
The general areal distribution of the Monte Cristo limestone, which is here rnade to include all the Mississippian rocks in the Goodsprings quadrangle, coincides closely with thttt of. the underlying Sultan limestone. In addition to the belt that extends from the.northern edge of the quadrangle southward around the western slope of the Spring Mountains, howevur, there are large areas in the vicinity of Potosi ~!fqunta.in, along Shenandoah Gulch, and along the southern part of the range.

SUBDIVISIONS
Lithologically the formation can be divided into five members, on the basis of distinct features of bedding as well as chert and fossil content. Beginning with the lowest and oldest they are here named Dawn limestone n1ember, Anchor limestone member, Bullion dolomite mernber, Arrowhead limestone men1ber, and Yellowpine limestone men1ber.

DAWN LIMESTONE MEMBER
Lithology.-The basal ~1ernber of the Monte Cristo. (>. for1nation, here nan1ed Dawn limestone men1ber, is
made up of massive lirnestone beds that are comrnonly frorn 2 to .10 feet thicl~. The color ranges from light bluish gray to dark Rn1oky gray, and the texture is porcelainlike or finely crystalline, except where the 1naterial is .altered to dolomite. In general stratigraphic features this lin1estone closely resembles the Volentine n1en1ber of the Sultan li1nestone, from which it is separated by the Crystal.Pass limestone. ·It lacks the one or two beds of chert-bearing limestone characteristic of the Valentine, and in addition it contains distinctive fossils.
The Dawn lhuestone derives its name fro1n the Dawn
rnine, in the SW. 34 sec. 15, T. 23 S., R. 58 E., west of
which it is well exposed. It is distinct and recognizable throughout a large part of the quadrangle, but there can be little doubt that it is absent in son1e places, such as along the ridge in the W. ~ sec. 24, T. 23 S., R. 57 E. Estimates of thickness are given above.
Although all the beds consist of limestone along the southern edge 'Of the quadrangle, they are largely dol01nite in 1nost of the area and undoubtedly have been altered during the deformation of the region, as described on pages 57-61. By this process the texture ·has bec01ne coarser and the color slightly lighter. The general features of the limestone are shown in Plate 38,·A.
Fossils.-This liruestone has yielded several large collections of fossils, but they are not abundant.

Some species are common to this and the overlying Anchor limestone.
ANCHOR LIMESTONE MEMBER
Lithology.-The Anchor limestone member is characterized by thick, massive beds of porcelain texture and light bluish-gray color. The beds commonly range fron1 20 to 50 feet in thickness and form broadly rounded outcrops, although adjacent to deep ravines the entire unit may form steep cliffs. In addition to its texture and absence of lamination, numerous layers of thert nodules are a persistent characteristic. These nodules range from rudely spherical to irregularly rounded elongated masses 2 to 3 inches thick and 5 to 10 inches long.· Such nodules are distributed in persistent parallel layers 3 to 10 inches apart. (See pl. 6, A.) In the region of the Bullion and Anchor mines and elsewhere these layers of nodules are well developed and are uniformly distributed across the outcrops of beds 50 feet or more thick. Most of the fossils collected. from this limestone were found in the~A nodules. Other forms of chert are conspicuously lacking. The general features of the beds are shown in Plates 6, A, and 38, A, B. The name is.derived from the Anchor mine, in sec. 23, T. 25 S., R. 58 E.
The Anchor lin1estone resists dolomitization almost as widely as the Crystal Pass limestone, but there are large belts within which it is completely altered to dolomite. Such a belt extends from the region of Kirby Wash southeastward 4 or 5 miles. Where the n1ember is overturned under the Keystone fault on the

18 GEOLOGY AND OJ;tE DEPOSITS OF GOODSPRINGS QUADRANGLE, NEVADA

west side of the range it is largely converted to dolomite. Many of the ore deposits of the region occur in the Anchor limestone (seep. 95), and near by the limestone is completely altered to dolomite, as in the Anchor, Monte Cristo, Whale, and other mines.
The upper limit of the Anchor limestone is a sinuous surface that separates it from the overlying Bullion dolomite member. This surface is locally nearly parallel to the bedding, but in a broad way they do not coincide. On the other hand, the upper surface of the Bullion dolomite is nearly parallel to the lower surface of the b-nchor limestone-that is, where the Bullion dolomite is thin the Anchor limestone is thick. If these relations are considered with the characteristic features of the Bullion dol01nite, it is clear that the Bullion is the altered upper part of a group of limestone beds of which the Anchor limestone is the unaltered lower part. Analyses recorded in the tables on pages 61-62 show that where the Anchor is unaffected by recent dolomitization it is a very pure limestone.
BULLION DOLOMITE MEMBER
Lithology.-The features of the beds here named Bullion dolonrite member of the Monte Cristo limestone are uncom~only uniforrn throughout the region. In the southern part of the quadrangle the beds generally consist of cremn-colored and coarsely crystalline material; weathered surfaces are darker and harsh to the touch, owing to the presence of many minute crystals of dolomite. North of Wilson Pass the beds are light gray to nearly white and more coarsely crystalline. Traces of bedding are present here and there, but the presence of numerous vertical joints where the beds dip at low angles permits erosion to form very rough and locally pinnacled surfaces. In son1e places the beds are n1uch crushed, and the fragments are recement.ed by white dol01nite veins. Throughout most of its areal extent this dolomite contains srnall irregular cavities, com1nonly lined with crystals of dolomite. Where the cavities are present, they are rather uniformly distributed through the rock. As explained on page 66 they were forn1ed during the process of dolomitization, and calcite was deposited in them, but this is generally dissolved from surface outcrops.
In sees. 2 and 3, T. 26 S., R. 58 E., south of the Christmas Inine, the Bullion dolon1ite is represented by limestone sin1ilar to that which makes up the underlying Anchor lime<stone. In the region farther north the dolonrite does not contain any rmnnants of the original limestone.
Chert is uncommon in the dolomite. In several parts of the region the lower limit of the member is the uppermost zone of chert nodules in the underlying Anchor limestone. The relations suggest that the solutions wpich produced the dolomitization were

hindered in their movement by the zones of chert nodules.
The name of this men1ber is derived from the Bullion mine, in sec. 23, T. 25 S., R. 58 E.
Fossils.-Only a few fossils have been found in the Bullion dolomite, but one of these, a brachiopod, Rhipidomella thiemi, appears to be restricted to this meinber, and it can generally be found.
ARROWHEAD LIMESTONE MEMBER
Although the Arrowhead member, named from a prospect in s~c..9, T. 24 S., R. 58 E., is only 10 to 20 feet thick it is widespread and possesses characteristics that permit its ready recognition throughout a large area. It is rnade up of alternating layers of blue and gray limestone 2 to 4 inches thick and thinner layers of gray shale. (See pl. 6, B.) The limestone layers do not have uniform thickness, and the limiting surfaces are wavelike rather than plane. No chert is present. As shown in the list of fossils (p. 20), this limestone contains an abundant and rather distinctive fauna, only a part of which is present in the underlying beds.
The limestone appears to be persistent throughout the range north of Columbia Pass but was not recognized west of the Keystone thrust. South of Columbia Pass it has been recognized only near the Ingomar mine and assuredly is absent near the Bill Nye mine and the mines on Porter Wash. In several places it, as well as the overlying massive limestone, was probably removed by erosion before the basal sandstone of the Bird Spring formation was deposited. In many localities this limestone rnarks the upper limit of d o l o m i ~iza t i o n .
YELLOWPINE LIMESTONE MEMBER
I
Throughout the range north of Columbia Pass the Arrowhead limestone is overlain by a massive ledge of dark-gray limestone, 60 to 120 feet thick (pl. 33, B), here named Yellowpine limestone member, from the principal mine of the region, in sec. 20, T. 24 S., R. 58 E. This limestone contains the productive ore bodies of the Yellow Pine, Potosi, Ingomar, and several other mines; but it is completely altered to dolon1ite near by. A distinctive feature is the persistent presence of great numbers of corals of the Zaphrentis group, 3 to 6 inches long, which lie prostrate and weather in relief; here and there they are accompanied by poorly preserved large gastropods. A similar bed overlies the Arrowhead limestone near the Milford and Ingon1ar mines and is present near the Accident and Christmas mines where that limestone could not be found.
AGE' AND CORRELATION OF MONTE CRISTO LIMESTONE
On the basis of the fossil collections, the identifica-
a:tions of which are presented on page 19, H. Girty,
of the Geological Survey, concludes that all the heds included in the Dawn and Anchor limestones and

CARBONIF.EROUS SYSTEM'.

19

Bullion dolonute are lower Mississippian, and that the fossils fr01n the Arrowhead limestone are of 1niddle Mississippian age; the few fossils from the Yellowpine li1nestone do not serve to establish its age, but it probably is 1niddle Mississippian also.
The fossil content of the Monte Cristo limestone warrants its correlation in a broad way with that group of li1nestones of lower and middle Mississippian age that are widespread over the Western States. On the other hand, there has been little detailed work in the region within 100 1niles of Goodsprings, on the basis of which precise correlations might be made. The c,haracteristic fossils of the Rogers Spring limestone of the Muddy Mountains 17 are present in the
n Longwell, C. R, Geology or tho Muddy Mountains, Nev.: Am. Jour. Sci., 5th sor., vol. I, p. 40, 1921.

Monte Cristo li1nestone, and the two formations are probably approximately equivalent. At more remote localities, such as the Grand Canyon, Ariz., the basal part of the Redwall limestone 1nay represent a part of the Monte Cristo li1nestone. Some of the faunal ele1nents of the Escabrosa·limestone in the Bisbee district, Arizona,18 450 miles to the southeast, closely resemble those included here. Beds of lower Mississippian age are not definitely recognized in northern and western Nevada; the fauna of the White Pine shale, which is extensive in eastern Nevada, indicates that it probably is all upper Mississippian,19 although lower Mississippian may possibly be represented in it.

lying Monte Cristo limestone, or of layers or persistent lenses from several inches to 6 feet thick. The layers of nodules are conspicuous in several beds riear .the base of the formation, but they occur sporadically throughout. Doubtless the silica now found as nodules was disseminated in tlie limestones when they were deposited, but the process of segregation took place after the burial and before recent weathering. Commonly nodules partly envelop and replace fossils, and some very large ones are found about 600 feet a"bove the base of the formation on the crest of the Bird Spring Range, replacing corals of the genus Chaetetes.
Only a few beds of clean sandstone are recorded, but many beds of apparently fine limestone contairi 5 to 50 per cent of sand grains (analyses 10 and 11, p. 61). Weathered surfaces of such beds show cross-bedding. In the several specimens that have been examined the range in size is 0.02 to 0.10 millimeter, but in single· specin1ens the range is much leas. About 90 per cent of the grains are clear quartz, but feldspar (microperthite and plagioclase) are also present, and zircon is an accessory. The grains are largely subangular, but a few of the largest are well rounded.
The thickest and most persistent sandstone in the formation is that which lies at 'the base. (See p. 46.) Although the outcrop of this sandstone is ·nowhere conspicuous, it extends throughout the region north of Columbia Pass. Where exposed in the workings of the Yellow Pine mine it is 23 to 28 feet thick, pale yellowish brown, fine grained, and without distinct bedding. On the surface from the Contact mine northwest to the Ninety-nine ,mine and around -Pot.osi Mountain to the Potosi mine it is thin bedded and distinguished by round brown markings, probably due to oxidized pyrite. For a distance of 1,200 feet near the Snowstorm mine, the sandstone zone is largely occupied by a bed of conglomerate whose maximum thickness is 10 feet. Here the conglomerate bed is made of two or three lenses of closely packed, well-rounded chert pebbles, whose maximum diameter is 4 inches. The conglomerate is overlain and underlain by 3 feet of sandstone. Both north and south from the area of maximum thickness the thickness decreases and the bed becomes a sandy limestone with sporadic pebbles as much as half an inch in diameter. . Near the Snowstorm mine the bed is highly indurated, owing to the presence under it of a sill of porphyry. Recent work at the Prairie Flower mine shows that a zone of conglomerate occupies the position of the sandstone. (Seep. 128.)
This bed of sandstone and conglon1erate is not noticeably unconformable on the underlying beds, but other features indicate that it marks a persistent unconformity in· the ·stratigraphic section. Probably there is not an appreciable unconformity in the range north of Columbia Pass, as; all the memhers of the Monte· Cristo limestone. are present under the sand-

stone. South of Columbia Pass, however, both the Arrowhead limestone men1ber of the Monte Cristo and the massive overlying bed are sporadic, and limestones with fossils characteristic of the Bird Spring formation rest on the Bullion dolomite member of the Monte Cristo, as, for example, hear the Bill Nye mine. Also the Bird Spring formation consists of thin-bedded limestones with considerable clastic material, whereas the underlying massive limestones are aln10st free of clastic rnaterial.
Fossils are common in the lower part of the formation and are abundant in some beds 100 to 300 feet above the base. A few beds may be recognized with assurance rather widely, not only on accoun~ of the fossil species present but by their abundance.
Several partial sections of the formation are given. below.

30 GEOLOGY AND ORE DEPOSITS OF GOODSPRINGS QUADRANGLE, NEVADA

According to Schuchert 20 and Noble,21 there i::~ probably an unconformity between the base of the Supai formation in the Grand Canyon and the underlying Redwall limestone (Mississippian). Darton 22 has expressed the opinion that this unconforn1ity is widespread in Arizona.
The Bird Spring formation of the Goodsprings quadrangle seems to be equivalent to the Callville · limestone (Pennsylvanian) of the l\1uddy Mountains.23 It is too early to make confident correlation with the beds of the Ely and other districts in northern Nevada.

SUPAI FORMATION
Areal distrib.ution.-Beds corresponding in stratigraphic position and lithology to the Supai formation 24 crop out in the valley mist of Cottonwood Pass (pl. 8, A) and east of Mule Spring Mountain. They are not known in the southern part of the quadrangle.
Lithology.-Where the fonnation is exposed in sec. 13, .T. 23 S., R. 58 E., the following section was measured:

The massive sandstone at the n1iddle of the forma-

tion is uncommonly hmnogeneous in color and size

of constituent grains. In the single speci1nen exam-

ined closely the grains were largely quartz and ranged

fro1n 0.2 to 0.5 millimeter in diameter. The sandstone

is made up of beds that largely range from 2 to 20

feet in thickness, although one is 40 feet thick. In

detail, each bed is made up of lenses, each of. which

in turn is n1ade up of thin laminae that dip more steeply

than the true bending. The same kind of cross-bedding

is present in the Aztec sandstone. (See p. 35.} The

color seems to be due to red clay washed down from

the overlying shale. Where this sandstone has been

traced northward frmn this area, it becomes thin and

inconspicuous. East of Mule Spring 1\!Iountain it was

not recognized, but the middle pa.rt. of the formation

contains considerable thin-bedded red sandstone.

The gypsum beds of the upper l)art of the forn1ation

have been explored by prospects in the region north

and east of the Goodsprings quadrangle. No fossils

were found in any part of the formation in this region.

Age and correlation.-The correlation of the Supai

formation in this region is based on the lithology and

fossil content of the overlying Kaibab limestone and

underlying Pennsylvanian limestones.

The massive sandstone at the middle of. the fornla-

tion bears a .close resemblance to the Coconino sand-

stone of western Arizona, and a correlation with that

formation was at first considered possible. The recent

work of Reeside and Bassler/5 however, shows clearly

that the Coconino sandstone thins steadily westward

from the Grand Canyon region and that in the Muddy

l\1ountains its identity is lost.26 The exposures in

the Goodsprings region are not good enough to pern1it

the recognition of an unconfonnity in the beds 1napped

as Supai form-ation; such as that found by Noble 27 in

the Grand Canyon and considered to n1ark the_ base

of the overlying Hermit shale. All the Permian ·beds

beneath the Kaibab limestone in the Goodsprings

quadrangle are therefore assigned to the Supai for-

mation.

KAIBAB LIMESTONE

Areal distribution.-Exceptionally complete and good exposures of the Kaibab limestone are shown along the north end of the Bird Spring Range, east of Cottonwood Pass, and in Mule Spring Mountain. Several isolated hills southward from Cottonwood Pass along the east front of the range display parts of the formation. The exposures of Mule Spring Mountain are the most western thus far known of this formation, which is so widely distributed in the southwestern part of the United States. 28

Lithology and thickness.-In this region a group of beds correlated with the ICaibab lin1estone of northern Arizo~n. is sepurable into three n1e1nbers. Each n1e1nber appears to have the san1e general character and n.pproxin1ate thickness throughout the quadrangle. Fro:m the base upward these 1ne1nbers consist of 1nassive limestone with son1e sn.ndstone, 200 to 230 feet thick; sandstone with smne shale, 20 to 30 fe.et thiek; n.nd 1nassive li1nestone, 200 to 210 feet thiek.

11ost of the species recorded in the fossi~ list below were collected frmn the uppel'lnost bed of this part of the ICaibab li1nestone. Ahnost every species recorded is present at the same horizon in the low hill in sec. 6, T. 25 S., H. 59 E. This part of the li1nestone n1akes the conspicuous ledge shown in Plate 8, A.
The 1niddle part of the l{aibab lin1estone is largely pn.le yellowish-brown sandstone, although locally the color is red, and thin zones of sandy shale are
present. In the S. %sec. 14, T. 24 S., R. 5S E., where
two prospect pits have been sunk in search of carnotite/0 this zone is 20 feet thick and is made up of 5 feet of yellowish sandstone below and Hi feet of dnrk-red shuly sand stoneabove. In the N. }~sec. 31, T. 22 S., H. 59 E., the sandstone beds n.re 30 feet thick.
1'he uppennost part of the ICaibab 'liinestone is a rn,ther rnassive bed of gray lin1estone frmn 200 to 210 feet thick. It is interrupted only by inconspicuous . bedding plnnes. By contrast with the lower limestone n1entber it contnins considerable chert, especially near the top. .{\.s this bed i·esists erosion and is overlain by soft shale, it conunonly underlies dip slopes that are thickly strewn with angular fragn1ents of reddish chert. Such surfaces are present on the west flank of the Bird Spring Range east of Cottonwood Pass, southwest of Goodsprings, and in sec. 6, T. 25 S., H.
59 E.
In this bed the chert fonns a few thin but persistent layers parallel to the bedding, as well as zones of s1nall nodules. These yield nu1nerous fossils but not the rn.nge of species found near the top of the middle Inmnber.

Only small parts of the uppermost shale member are exposed, but in several localities, as on the north border of the quadrangle and in the valley south1of the Lavina mine, the uppermost limestone of the Moenkopi for¢ation is overlain by red shale. Above this lie two beds of coarse conglomerate which are correlated with the Shinarump conglomerate of western Utah and Arizona. In the areas where this conglomerate was observed the rocks are so much folded that. no close measurements of the thickness of the underlying red shale could be made.
According to Longwell,32 there is an unconformity at the base of the Moenkopi formation on the north. slope of the Spring Mountains. Conclusive evidence· of an unconformity has not been found in the Goodsprings area, but the sporadic· conglomerate at the base is highly suggestive that one is present.
Lithology.-The conglomerate at the base of the Moenkopi formation is present a mile northeast of Cottonwood Pass and 1,000 feet east of Goodsprings, but it is absent in the hills southeast of Cottonwood Pass and 2 miles southeast of Goodsprings.

Age and correlation.-The fauna and lithologic features of the Kaibab limestone are so distinctive that no uncertainty is attached to correlation with characteristic exposures in northwestern Arizona and southwestern Utah.
The number of members and the general character of each bear a close resemblance to those recorded by Reeside in southwestern Utah 30 except that the uppermost Harrisburg gypsiferous member of that region is absent in Nevada. Nearly the same divisions were observed also by Longwell 31 in the Muddy Mountains.
TRIASSIC SYSTEM
MOENKOPI FORMATION
Areal distribution.-In this region the Moenkopi formation consists of three distinct members-at the base a member composed of conglomerate and associated red shale approximately 150 feet thick; a middle member of thin-bedded buff sandy limestone and dolomite, which attains a maximum thickness of 600 feet; and an uppermost member of red sandy shale, of undetermined thickness but probably not exceeding 200 feet, which 2 mil~s west of Goodsprings is represented by tuff and conglomerate containing igneous pebbles. The best exposures of the beds occur·in the belt that extends from Cottonwood Pass northeastward to the corner of the quadrangle. They also crop out for several miles west of Goodsprings, and 466 feet of beds crop out between the top of the Kaibab limestone and the Keystone fault .in the NW. X sec. 6, T. 25 S., R. 59 E. The formation is not known on the west side of this part of the Spring Mountains.

Southe~st of Cottonwood Pass the lowest member of the Moenkopi is made up of a zone of red shale about 75 feet thick, which rests upon the upper limestone bed of the· Kaibab limestone. It is overlain by a less per3istent zone of greenish-gray shale, also about 75 feet thick. Both zones are well exposed in
the SW. X sec. 24, T. 23 S., R. 58 E., east of bench
mark 4649. The lower red shale crops out southwest of Goodsprings, and ~tis present in many wells in the

town. Other wells in the town show the green shale, but it is thinner here than farther north..
The mid~le n1ember of the Moenkopi is made up of buff sandy liinestone and dolomite that largely range fro1n 1 to 5 feet in thickness but locally attain 10 feet. These limestone beds are separated by thin beds of gray and greenish shale. Here and there, especially near the top, the lin1estones are highly fossiliferous, the starlike plates of Pentacrinus· being sufficiently widespread to permit the identification of isolated outcrops.
By contrast with 1nost of the Paleozoic lin1estones, those of the Moenkopi formation are unifol'lnly sandy and sufficiently rich in iron to yield buff to light-brown 1naterial by weathering. The content of sand is shown on outcrops by persistent lamination of even the 1nassive layers. One specimen collected in the upper
part of the li1nestone member, in the SE. X sec. 13,
T. ·22 S., R. 58 E., yielded by solution in hydrochloric acid about 25 per cent of sand. Nearly all the sand gru.ins were quartz, were subangular in forn1, and ranged fro1n 0.01 to 0.03 millin1eter· in dian1eter. Traces of chlorite were present, but feldspars were conspicuously absent. Chert nodules are very uncominon in the formation.
About a mile south of the Lavina shaft, north of the center of sec: 28, T. 24 S., R. 58 E., there are two small exposures of tuffaceous rock and .conglomerate of igneous pebbles whose relations are obscure but which are tentatively placed in the 11:oenkopi formation. Both areas are narrow belts that lie along the north sides of shallow ravines, and each is entirely surrounded by wash. .It can only be said with assurance that the beds overlie the limestone n1ember of the Moenkopi and underlie the Shinarump conglomerate. The 1nost abundant 1nateria.l is highly indurated greenish-gray tuff, which shows small white grains of feldspar. Thin sections of the 1naterial show that it is 1nade up of angular grains that largely range fr01n 0.05 to 0.25 millin1eter in dia1neter. About one-fourth of the grains u.re brownish glass, and the remainder are oligoclase, orthoclase, and to a less degree biotite. The prevailing strike of the largest exposure is S. 60°
W., o.nd the dip 70° S. The dip accords with that of
near-by outcrops of Moenkopi limestone, but the strike is difl'erent. There can be no doubt that these beds have participated in the ·folding that deformed the rest of the Moenkopi forn1ation.
South of the belt of tuffs, and therefore overlying them, are exposed several lenses of conglon1erate in · which the well-rounded cobbles largely range fro'm 3 to 6 inches, o.lthough a f.ew exceed 10 inches in diameter. Most of the cobbles are composed of reddish trachyte flow, but a few are indurated breccia. Mo.ny pebbles show spotadic alteration to epidote and are therefore green. This altera.tion clearly took pla.ce before the cobbles were rounded by erosion.

Considerable interest is attached to the presence of

volcanic material in the early Mesozoic rocks of this

region, and it is unfortunate that the exposures are

isolated instead of exposed in a. continuous section.

So far as the writer is aware, the only persistent beds

of igneous rocks are the volcanic clays that overlie the

Shinarump conglomerate in southern Utah. These

clays J:lave attracted attention because they contain

small quantities of gold.33 Microscopic examination of

the material by the writer indicates that it is a variety

of bentonite and probably a decomposed tuff.

In contrast with these rocks, the Tertiary tuffs of

this region have a different composition, show a dif-

ferent type of alt~ration, and have lower angles of dip.

There seems to be but slight chance. that these rocks

are of Tertiary age. (Seep. 40.)

.

According to H. G. Ferguson,34 there is near Cande-

laria, Nev., a great thickness of andesitic tuffs which

probably overlie slate and sandstone of Lower Triassic

.age. There is a fair possibility that these tuffs were

deposited contemporaneously with the tuffs and con-

glomerates of the Moenkopi formation of the Good-

springs quadrangle.

Fossils.-Fossils are comn1on in the limestones of

the formation, but the number of species is not large.

POST-.TURASSIC ROCKS

The rocks of the early group are separable into two

The rocks of this region that are younger than the Aztec sandstone fall readily into three groups, but as they contain no fossils definite age assignments can not· be given to them. From what is known of the geology of several areas.as much as 200 miles distant, however, it seems possible to estimate their ages approximately. These units include (1) intrusive igneous rocks of two -varieties; (2) bedded tuffs, breccias, dikes, and flows of volcanic rock; (3) consolidated and unconsolidated gravel and boulders. The tuffs, breccias, and flows are considered to be related to near-by volcanic necks to which a .middle Tertiary age is assigned, probably upper Miocene, and they are therefore herein classified as Miocene ('?). (See p. 40.). The gravel and boulders are distinctly younger and are considered so be of Pleistocene age.

varieties.· One of these varieties, here classified as granite porphyry, is a light-colored, rather coarse grained rock that forms a number of dil\:es and sills in the central part of the quadrangle. The total area underlain by these rocks is limited to several hundred acres. The other variety was noted as small dil\:es in three mines only, the Singer, Puelz, and Star. It is a dark rock of finer grain than the light-colored rock, and although it shows slight variations in texture and mineral content it is classed as lamprophyre.
The later group of fine-grained igneous rocks includes several varieties that take the form of volcanic necks, dikes, and surface flows. Bedded tuffs are associated with the flows .. These rocks range from latite through several varieties of andesite to basalt. They underlie a larger ~.rea than the coarse-grained intrusive rocks, but it scarcely exceeds 3 square miles. The area lies

dikes of this variety of rock recognized a.re those in which the Red Cloud n1ine lies (p. 103), the dike that extends northeastward from the Alice mine (p. 137), and the one explored in the Boss Extension mine tunnel. One of the drifts near the bottom of the east shaft of the Columbia mine explores a dike of similar rock.
This rock pre;;ents only slight variations from the average in composition, texture, and color; the variations in color seem to be dtle largely to alteration since its intrusion. The only exposures of fresh rock were fo.und in several dikes southeast of .Crystal Pass. (See pl. 9, A.) Here the rock contains many crystals of orthoclase, as much as 1 centimeter long, in a groundmass of· microgranular· orthoclase through which iron oxide is dusted. Some of· the crystals show zonal growth, and others eontain nuclei of a.ggregates of orthoclase. There are a few rounded aggregates of dark-green biotite, slightly altered to chlorite; these appear in hand specimens. The groundn1ass contains accessory zircon and apatite. No quartz appears either in hand specimens or in thin sections.
From this dike northwestward all exposures of the rock, surface and under.ground, are considerably altered; probably the n10st thoroughly aHered is the Yellow Pine sill. The coarsest texture is found in a dike just south of Crystal Pass, which ·may be traced 750 feet and which attains a maximum width of 30 feet. In the middle part of the dike crystals of reddish-brown orthoclase fron1 0.5 to 2 inches long make up about one-third of the volume. The crystals separate freely from the matrix, are uncommonly perfect, and. present several of the cornmon types of twins, Carlsbad, Baveno, and others. The border zones, 3 to 8 inches thick, a.re fine grained. There are no dark n1inerals or qua.rtz in this dike. About 1,500 feet south of this dike is another, 40 feet thick, along which· the dolomitized Crystal Pass lin1estone is a.ltered to serpentine (p. 56).
The dikes of granite porphyry in the belt of Goodsprings dolomite from the Columbia to the Keystone mine crop out in loca.l depressions, a.nd ma.ny have been explored by prospects because the record of the Keystone a.nd Red Cloud mines indicated that the rock might be gold-bearing. Underground the rock brea.ks in a.ngula.r blocks, but on the dumps these soon disintegrate. This rock is uniformly light colored, either slightly gree~ish or yellowish, but the texture is obscure.
. The Keystone dike is an extren1ely irregular body that generally cuts across the bedding of the indosjng dolomite but locally conforms with it. In the central part of the body the feldspars are completely altered to a reddish clay, and the rnatrix is a pale-greenish material. The borders are highly sheared and have
lost all trace of texture (:p. 106). A tunnel·in the dike
1,500 feet south of the Keystone mine reveals angular

blocks of dolomite as much as 2 feet in diameter in the porphyry, but they show no alteration. Sparse crystals· of qua.rtz were noticed in the Keystone dike.
The Yellow Pine sill underlies about 100 acres near the mine and weathers to smooth, rounded forms of low relief. Even though it is considerably altered the texture is still preserved, both on the surface and underground.. The orthoclase crystals are largely untwinned and range from 0.25 to 0.5 inch in length. Generally they are distinctly reddish and darker than the groundmass. There are sporadic areas within which quartz is common as slightly rounded grains 0.125 to 0.5 inch long. Neither mica nor hornblende is conspicuous, but these may have been destroyed by alteration, as the rock from the deeper mine workings contains disseminated pyrite. Tests indicate that the feldspar crystals as well as the matrix are now largely sericite. The north end of the Yellow Pine sill on the Snowstorm claims is the most northern outcrop of the porphyry observed in the district.
The evidence that these porphyry intrusions preceded the deposition of the ore minerals is fairly conclusive. At the Red Cloud mine 'large quantities of the dike rock have been treated for the gold content (p. 103),. At the Keystone and Lavina mines the orebearing fractures cut through the dikes (pp. 106, 108), and in the Yellow Pine rnine there are mineral-bearing fractures which displace the thick sill that overlies the ore bodies (p. 136). In 'the Keystone and Yellow Pine mines the fractures that break the dike and sill are probably related to the later part of the epoch of thrust faults (p. 47).
The best evidence of the age of these intrusive rocks is based upon their place in the succession of structural events in the region..In the chapter on structure (p .. 54) the conclusion ·is reached that they were intruded in either late Cretaceous or early Tertiary time, probably the latter.
· Lamprophyre dikes.-At three localities in the quadrangle-the Singer, Puelz, and Star mines-fairly · crystalline basic dikes are exposed. In the upper workings. of the Singer mine a dike of dark rock 3 to 5 feet wide trends northeast and stands vertically. At one place it is divided into three parallel dikes 1 to 3 feet wide.. There is no noticeable contact effect on the adjacent dolomite. Biotite and hornblende are conspicuous in the hand specimen, but a thin section sh9ws green aiigite, brown hornblende, and brown biotite, named in decreasing order of abundance. The matrix is composed of small crystals of labradorite with apatite and magnetite.
The dike at the Puelz mine crops out in an open cut. It is 'I to 5 feet wide and is slightly flatter than the local bedding. The dolomite under the dike is heavily stained with limonite, and it may have been slightly altered to siderite before weathering. The dike has a finer texture than that at the Singer mine, but the

All these dikes are classified as lamprophyres. Their 1nineral c01nposition and texture indicate that they are c01nplmnentary to the granite porphyry, and their occurrence either in mineral-bearing fmilts or near ore deposits suggests that they were intruded in the epoch preceding ore deposition.
FINE-GB.AINED IGNEOUS UOCKS
The fine-grained igneous rocks· are localized in six n.roas.:_B~g Devil, Sultan, Table Mountain, and three s1naller areas.
Big Devil area.-Although only the northern edge of the Big Devil intrusive n1ass lies within the quadrangle, it is an uncomn1on rock and justifies brief description. Diablo Grande .(Big Devil) Peak (5,865 feet) forms a conspicuous cone along the axis of the Spring J\1ountains south of the Goodsprings quadrangle. (See pl. 9, B.) It is a si1nple intrusive 1nass about 8,000 feet in dia1neter, which cuts through the nearly horizontal Paleozoic section, so that on· the surface the intrusive rock is in contact with. beds that range frmn tho Goodsprings dolomite to the upper part of tho Bird Spring fonnation. There are sn1all patches of related tuffs, breccias, and flows on the northeast, east, south, and west borders. The lack· of locally disturbed beds around the borders indicates that the intrusive displaced a block of the limestones by pushing it out. The surface on which the tuffs and breccins rest hns low relief and is sn1o_pther than most of the near-by surfnce.
As exposed at the surface the rock is light gray and very fine grained, without visible coarse crystals. Mnuy blocks show parallel lenticular cavities, which indicate that the rock n1oved appreciably while still viscous. ,The northern pa.rt has a persistent system of vertical joints that trend north and under weathering yield rugged pinnacles. The rock is weathered several shades of brown. A thin section shows -a groundmass of microgranular texture without any crystals nn1eh larger than the average and without glass. The grains range frmn 0.02 to 0.06 millimeter in dian1eter. ·The principal1nineral is orthoclase, but there are traces of sodic plagioclase and quartz. Minute crystals of biotite, 0.02 to 0.5 millimeter in diameter, to the extent of several per cent, are uniformly distributed thrQugh the Inass. According to a partial analysis by J. G. Fairchild7 of the Geological Survey, the rock contains silica, 73.58 per cent; lime, 0.05 per cent; soda, 2.99 per cent; and potash, 5.52 per cent. It is classified as rhyolite, even though it contains less than the common amount of quartz.

The only breccia near this intrusive rock included

in the quadrangle occupies an area 75 by 400 feet in

the S. Yz sec. 2, T. 26 S., R. 58 E. It is made up of

angular blocks of dense gray rhyolite as much as 12

by 15 by 20 inches, embedded in a si1nilar fine-grained

matrix.

The alteration of the Paleozoic limestone in contact.

with the rhyolite is discussed on pages 67-68. (See pl.

10, A.)

.

Sultan area.-North of the Sultan mine there is an

·area of about a square mile underlain by tuffs and

flows, and three smaller areas of similar material

extend as far as the Tiffin mine. The source of most

of this material is probably a volcanic neck in the

NE. Xsec. 19, T. 25 S., R. 58 E., but a part may be derived from a smaller neck a mile south, in the. NE. X

sec. 30, T. 25 S., R. 58 E.

The outcrop of the larger neck is lenticular, about

600 by 1,200 feet, and it occupies a low saddle in a

ridge, thus showing that lmder the prevailing dry

climate the igneous rock is less resistant to disintegra-

tion than the near-by limestones of the Sultan forma-

tion. (See pl. 10, B.) The limestones are fractured

but otherwise are not n1uch disturbed around the

border. The dolonute of the Monte Cristo lirr1estone

on the northern border is bleached and altered as

described on pages 67-68.

The intrusive rock is pale reddish, and the only

visible crystals in the dense grou:r;tdmass are flakes of

brown biotite. It weathers into angular blocks. It

has not been examined in thin section but seems to be

a latite similar to the flow a mile ~ast and that in the

other neck a mile south.

The smaller neck measures about 300 by 1,500 feet

and lies along the north slope of a ravine. The north-

ern limit is a· vertical wall·of dolomite, but the southern

litnit is obscure. The central and largest part of the neck is a pale-reddish, laye~ed rock that shows a. few

crystals of orthoclase and biotite in a dense glassy

groundmass. The thin section does not reveal other

minerals but shows typical trachytic fabric. At

several places along the border there are lenses of a

black vitreous variety that show a vertical layering
and here and there contain angular fragments of the

pale-reddish variety. Cur!ously the dark rock con-

tains no orthoclase but a little sodic plagioclase in a

groundmass of glass. It contains a few augite crystals

but no biotite. Probably these slight differences in

mineral constitu.tion do not deserve much consideration,

and the two rocks may be regarded as varieties of latite.

A partial section of the tuffs and flows northeast of

the Sultan mine is presented below. The total thick-

ness of tuff differs from place to place according to the

form of the irregular surface of the limestones on which

it rests; probably it does not exceed 400 feet. The

tuffs strike N. 30° W. and dip 30° E.

ALLUVIUM

41

As shown on· Plate 1 several patches of the later .alluviun1 lie at a higher altitude than the· patches of early alluvitun. The most northern area lies near Cottonwood Pass, but five others lie along. Good·springs Valley. There is an isolated area near the Red Cloud 1nine and another west of Wilson Pass, in the
SW. %sec. 34, T. 23 S., R. 57 E. In the center of
sec. 24, 'I'. 23 S.', R. 58 E., east of Cottonwood Pass, an area of several acres is strewn with simi~ar boulders, but they have nwved locally by the erosion and slmnping of the underlying n1aterial.
The 1naterial that caps the hill in the west center of sec. 30, T. 23 S., R. 59 E., is typical of the early alluviun1 and will be described in detail. The deposit is about 100 feet thick, and it rests on a surface that slopes gently southeast. The largest boulder is Kaibab li1nestone, 5 by 5 by 7 feet, but n1ost of the boulders are light-brown quartzite, uncommonly well rounded. The. largest quartzite boulder is 2}~· by 3 by 4 feet. Son1e of the boulders show· traces of facets, and all are covered with percussion marks. No glacial striae could be found. It is an interesting feature of the cherty limestone boulders that the layers of chert stand in relief, from one-haJf to 1% inches above the adjacent limestone, which shows evidence of solution. The Inatrix of the large boulders is a nuxture of small uncemented boulders, gravel, and sand. It is clear that the n1aterial has been subjected to weathering for a long time, doubtless longer than the later alluvium, which forn1s remnants in the northeast corner of the quadrangle.
'l'he lin1estone and dolomite boulders might· be derived fr01n several parts of the near-by range, but the source of the quartzite boulders 1nust be sought farther away, because no beds of quartzite are known in the rn,nge southeast of Charleston Peak. The work of T'. B. Nolan,43 who was associated with C. R. Longwell in the exrunination of the Spring Mountains in 1923, shows that there are extensive areas of quartzite beds of Cmnbrian age along the range 15 miles northwest of Charleston Peak. Plate 12, A, which is a view taken fr01n the crest of the ~ird Spring Range, shows an old valley that extends N. 35° W. fron1 the hill in sec. 30, T. 23 S., R .. 59 E., through the pass in the range toward Charleston Peak, 35 miles distant. The gradient of the 8 miles of the channel in this qundrangle is about 100 feet to the mile, and in 40 nliles northwest the channel would attain an ·altitude of about 8,700 feet. As the hills of Carnbrian qum·tzite in that neighborhood now range frOin 8,200 to 8,500 feet, they could have been the source of the boulders. Speculation concerning the source of the boulders is not worth while here, but it should be noted that this channel is now broken into three parts by recent capture. The northwestern.part

drains west to Pahrump Valley, the middle part as far southeast as Cottonwood Pass drains northeast to Las Vegas .Valley, and the southeastern part drains south to I.vanpah Valley. It seems clear that in early Pleistocene or even late Tertiary time a vigorous stream flowed southeastward from the region of the Arnargosa Desert past Charleston Peak toward Ivanpah Valley, possibly even to the Colorado River. It is noteworthy that the gradient does not seem to be disturbed by recent uplift or by faulting.
This channel offers a reasonable explanation of the source of ·the boulder deposits at the north end of Goodsprings Valley but does not explain the deposit near the Red Cloud n1ine, which is also largely made up of quartzite boulders. Probably this deposit was also brought across the range by another stream flowing southeast from the hills north of Pahrump Valley to Ivanpah Valley. Such a stream niight also have carried the boulders found in sec. 34, T. 23 S., R. 57 E.
The existence of such strean1 channels has a direct bearing on the general pattern of early Pleistocene or late Tertiary drainage in this region and the manner by which it changed fron1 a region of extensive drainage lines, possibly leading to the Colorado River, to a region containing several closed basins, which receive only local drainage. This will be considered further in connection with the survey of the Ivanpah quad-
ra.ngle now in. progress.
Later alluvium.-Patches of later alluvium are found in five areas in the quadrangle-in the northeast corner north of Cottonwood Valley, along the \vest slope of the Spring Mountains north of Mountain Springs, on the tops of several hills 3 miles west of Wilson Pass, at the n10uth of Keystone Wash, and along the ridge several n1iles northwest of Goodsprings. Unlike the. ·early alluvium, which was largely derived from sources northwest of the Spring Mountains, the later· alluvium may be wholly derived from local sources. ·
The northeastern area includes four remnants of what was probably once a more widespread, continuous layer: The greatest thickness of these remnants is about 300 feet, which is found in the most northern one, in sec. 13, T. 22 S., R. 58 E. The gravel· shows a great range in size, from the fine material that forms the n1atrix to huge blocks 6 by 6 by 8 feet. One block 40 by 15 feet was noted in ·the
NE. Xsec.18, T. 22 S., R. 59 E. These blocks include
all the varieties of limestone and dolomite of the Paleozoic section, but the uppe.r part of the deposit locally contains a few blocks of sandstone (Aztec sandstone?). All the blocks are characteristically angular in outline and cemented by calcite. The ren1nants rest upon a surface that slopes uniforn1ly northeast at a gradient of about _250 feet· to the 1nile and therefore slightly steeper than the recent wash near by. The underlying rocks are thin limestones of the Moenkopi formation. Viewed broadly, the mate-

BROAD FEATURES OF THE REGION
Until 191.9, when Longwell undertook a detailed ·study of the Muddy Mountains,46 little was la1own of the structure of the ranges of southern Nevada. The visits of Gilbert 47 and Spurr 48 served only to indicate the most apparent structural featpres. The outstanding structural feature discovered by Longwell was tho presence of imm.ense sheets of old sediments (Dcvoni~.n limestone) resting on top of 1nnch younger sediments (J'urassic sandstone),· which indicates that there were enonnous overthrusts in the region. Work in the Goodsprings quadrangle by the writer during 1921 and 1922 showed that similar overthrusts are present in the Spring ~1ountains, and it is now known that overthrusts are a characteristic feature of n1any ranges in ~011f'.hern Nevada.
For structural study the quadrangle 1nay be divided into four areas, the lines o.f separation on the surface being extensive overthrust faults which, if projected downward, 1nark the lower li1nits of great con1posite 1nasses of rock that have been thrust upon other underlying 1nasses. (See pl. 11.) The eastern and lowest mass ahnost coincides with the Bird Spring Range and will be called the Bird Spring block Although it is broken by a few faults, it is otherwise a fairly simple block of sedi1nents that range in age from Upper Ca1nbrian to Jurassic(?), overthrust along the east frtee of the range upon beds of Permian and Triassic age. The overthrust crops out east of the Goodsprings qun.drangJe.
The seeond structural area includes the central higher part of the Spring Mountains, from the pass enst ·of Mountain Springs on the north nearly to Columbia Pass, 12 nules south. This mass is separated frmn the underlying n1ass by the Contact overthrust fault, well exposed for several 1niles near the Contact1nine but onlyfr01n place to place farther south. This block is bounded on the west by bhe Keystone overthrust, which may be traced from the north edge of the quadrangle southward around the west side of the range to Keystone Wash, thence eastward across

It is rather complex structurally. Along the Contact overthrust fault beds 11S old as Upper Cambrian are thrust eastward on those as young as the Shinarun1p conglOinerate (Upper (?) Triassic).

The third structural area is limited on the east by the l{~eystone ove~thrust fault, on the west by the wash of Mesquite Vall~y, and in the southwestern part of the range by the Sultan overthrust. In the north half of the quadrangle this mass is rather si1nple, almost a homocline, but in the south half it is much folded and broken by many faults. Along the Keystone overthrust beds of the Goodsprings dolomite are thrust upon those as high in the stratigraphic section as the

The general relations of these four areas are shown in Plate 11.
In the description of the stratigraphy it is stated that the relations of the beds indicate that although there are two major and possibly several minor unconformities present, which indicate slight local oscillations in the ea.rth's crust, there were no great dislocations here between the early Cambrian and the Jurassic. At a later time, either in the late Cretaceous or early Tertiary, there were great disturbances, recorded now as complicated folds and both thrust and normal faults, and during two epochs bodies of igneous rock were

For each of these blocks the limiting thrust faults are traced and. described. These descriptions are followed by descriptions of the minor thrust faults, the normal faults, and the folds. These descriptions must necessarily be brief in an economic report, though it is hoped that the picture will be found adequate. Finally, a summary of the probable relations of the principal thrust faults and the chronologie succession of events is presented.
BIRD SPRING BLOCK

CONTACT BLOCK
The Contact block is limited downward by the· Contact thrust fault, which lies along the east base of the Spring Mountains, and upward by. the Keystone thrust fault1 which lies largely along the west base of the range. Both on the north, nea.r Mountain Springs: Pass, and on the south, near Columbia Pass, the· Contact thrust passes under the Keystone thrust.. The block also contains two impressive thrust faults,. the Potosi and Wilson, as well as several other minorthrust faults. In contrast with the underlying Bird.

Pauline and Contact mines, where the dip ranges from 15° to 20° W. As shown in Plate 1, the overlying Paleozoic limestones are thrown into a broad anticline whose axial plane dips steeply west. Doubtless this is the same as the overturned anticline shown west of Cottonwood Pass, 2 miles to the· northeast. East of tho Contact mine the Aztec sandstone, which dips west near by, is sharply turned up under the Contact thrust, so as to forn1 a local syncline. The position of the thrust is a.gain indicated several miles to the south by the local relations of patches of red Aztec sandstone in ravines and the thin li1nestones of the Bird Spring formation in the near-by hills. (See sec. E-F, pl. 2.) Near the Lavina 1nine the thrust shows between patches of Shinarump conglon1erate in the wash and the hills of Goodspring dolomite. Between the Ruth mine and Colun1bia Pass the thrust is continuously exposed at two places for several thousand feet, where limestone of the Bird Spring formation rests on folded beds of Shinarump conglomerate and red shales of the Chinle forn1ation. Outcrops clearly show that the Contact thrust, trending south and dipping west, ·passes under the Keystone thrust, which trends east and dips south. The thrust is offset by the Ruth fault, and both of these, as well as the overlying Keystone fault, are displaced by· a northwardtrending normal fault. The norn1al fault contains sporadic copper n1inerals that have been explored by the Cosmopolitan clain1 (p. Ill); hence it preceded the mineralization. On the Rattler claim; south of the Ruth mine, several prospects have explored lenses of galena in the breccia of the Contact thrust, and the shoot of galena ore in the Ruth mine lies in crushed beds adjacent to the Ruth fault. These. occurrences, as well ar: sev-eral prospects near the Pauline mine which exp1ore lead deposits in the breccia of the Con-· tact fault, show that the mineralization followed these thrust faults as well as some normal faults.
The dike of granite porphyry in which the Lavina voins lie was intruded along the Contact fault. These relations indicate .that the distribution of porphyry intrusions nnd ore deposits is controlled by the n1ajor thrust faults of the region.
'rho Potosi thrust is inconspicuous where it lies in the thin-bedded lin1estones of the Bird Spring fornl.ation, but once identified in the ravines north of the Red Cloud n1ine it is ·readily traced northward to the region near Potosi Mountain, where the entire Sultan limestone and part of the Monte Cristo limestone are duplicated above it. (See sec. C-D, pl. 2, and pl. 13, A, B.) Parts of the Potosi thrust are shown northeast of the Ninety-nine fault, along which the northeast side is dropped 1,800 feet. A second fault, parallel to the Ninety-nine, drops it about 400 feet more. In its northwest extension the thrust passes under the Keystone thrust. Near the Snowstorm mine the dip of the Potosi thrust is .50° W. (sec. E-F, pl. 2), but it

decreases steadily northward, so that under Potosi Mountain it is only 30°. (See sec. Q-D, pl. 2.) The breccia 7.0ne that marks this thrust is'·not.conspicuous;.
·commonly it is only about 10 feet thick, and fl,t no place is it more than 25 feet.
The Wilson thrust crops out only in beds high above the base of the Bird Spring formation, but near " 7ilson Pass and west of 'the Red Cloud 1nine it is readily traceable by. slight differences in the dip of the overlying and underlying beds. It may not extend as far south as the Keystone thrust; northward i~ disappears where it meets an extensive syncline. Under Shenandoah Peak the dip of the thrust is about 40° W., but north of Wilson Pass it increases to 65° and probably it decreases northward. (See sec. E-F, pl. 2.) Under Shenandoah Peak this thrust is overlain by a zone of crumpling of the beds (see fig. 8) above which the beds have been thrust forward at least several hundred feet. The breccia zone .of the Wilson thrust in few places exceeds 10 feet in thickness.
Viewed broadly, the beds within the Contact block present more folds than those in any other block. There is a locally overturned antieline at the north end where the beds rest on the Contact thrust ncar the Cottonwood fault. (See sec. C-D, pl. 2.) Farther south, above a minor thrust fault, there is a broad antieline that n1ay be traced 5 miles south to the Contact mine, even. though broken by the Ninety-nine and other near-by faults. Con1plementary to this broad anticline, in the northern half of· the Contact block, is a persistent syncline which may be traced for 6 miles along the west side of the range as far south as the ridges west of Wilson Pass. Near the Potosi mine the beds on the west limb of the syncline are vertical for several miles and are loeally overturned.
In· the north half of the Contact block, where the Potosi thrust dips about 30°, there are no minor folds, but in the south half, where the Potosi and Wilson faults dip 40? W. or more, there are many minor folds, most of which trend north and have axial planes that dip west. Thus, west of the Contact mine there are sev-eral closely spaced folds between the Contact and Potosi thrusts. Also, near the crest of the range north of Wilson Pass there is a closely folded belt between the Potosi and Wilson thrusts. Still farther ~outh­ west, west of Shenandoah Peak, there is a belt of folds between the Wilson and Keystone thrusts. These relations indicate that wbere the minor blocks moved forward readily on thrust faults of low dip, compressive stresses were relieved. By contrast, where the faults were steep, stress accumulated locally and was relieved by the forn1ation of minor folds. This interpretation· indicates that the minor folds were formed at the same time, or after the movement on minor thrust faults, whereas the major folds probably were formed at the same time as or ea.rlier than the maj9r thrust fRuits.

46 GEO.LOGY AND ORE DEPOSITS OF GOODSPRINGS QUADRANGLE, NEVADA

As noted above, the axes of the folds trend generally north. There is one outstanding exception-a pronounced anticline west of Shenandoah Peak that trends west. (See sec. G-H, pl. 2.) The position .and trend of this fold indicate that it Inay have been formed by the local slipping on the Ironside fault, roughly yontemporaneous with the K.eystone thrust and appreciably hiter than folds of the Contact block.
STRUCTURAL GEOLOGY NEAR YELLOW PINE, PRAIRIE FLOWER, AND RED CLOUD MINES
General feat·ures . -Inas1nuch as the local areal geology has a critical bearing on the interpretation of the relations of the ore bodies of the Yellow Pine and other near-by mines, it is.here described in advance of the mines. In studying the area, the writer has had the benefit of a topographic and areal geologic map made by R. D. Longyear in 1920 for the Y ~llow Pine Mining Co.
The bedded rocks exposed in this area include the Bullion dol01nite, the shaly Arrowhead limestone, 10 to 12 feet thick, and the Yellowpine limestone, 70 to 120 feet thi~k (mmnbers of the 1-fonte Cristo forn1ation); the sandstone at the base of the Bird Spring formation, 22 to 28 feet thick; and the higher thin-bedded limestones, shales, and thin sandstones of the Bird Spring. The only igneous rocks noted are the sill of granite porphyry that lies above the Yellow Pine mine and the related dikes of similar rock in that Inine and near the Alice and Red Cloud n1ines.
The Bullion dolon1ite forins the crest of the ridge eaf?t of the Yellow Pine mine and is cut off on the south by the dike of porphyry that extends from .the Alice mine northeastward to the mouth of Middlesex (Horseshoe) Gulch. It forms the crest of the ridge farther east (Ruth Mountain). It also crops out on the low ridge east of the Prairie Flower mine and a mile north across the flat, where it forms the crest of the ridge east of the Snowstorm mine. Throughout this area the Bullion dolomite is a coarsel:y crystalline bluish-gray dolomite without evidence of bedding. It contains the principal workings of the Arrowhead, Blue Jay, and Snowstorm mines on the north and the Copper Glance and several prospects east of the Yellow Pine mine. In a few places· (200-foot level) the workings of the Yellow Pine mine penetrate it.
The shaly Arrowhead limestone crops out east of the Yellow Pine mine (pl. 6, B), iut it .could not be found where areal relations indicate that it should appear nea.r the Middlesex mine n,nd on the surface east of the Prairie Flower mine. On the other hand, it was found on. the Snowstorm claims and northward, and it is exposed in cliffs west of the Arrowhead prospect. It is also exposed at Inany places in theYellow Pine mine, and in Plate 36, B, the structure contours have been drawn on top of it. It displays the typical alternat-:

ing layers of dolomitized limestone, 2 to 3 inches . thick, separated by shale partings half an inch or less thick.
The Yellowpine limestone crops out at the Yellow Pine mine, on the hill at the Prairie Flower shaft, and on the Snowstorm clain1s a 1nile north. Patches of unaltered dark-gray limestone may be seen near the Prairie Flower shaft, but elsewhere the bed is completely dolon1itized. .(See analyses, p. 62.) Although traces of bedding were noted locally underground in the Yellow Pine mine, the bedding is not conspicuous on the surface. The only 1neasuren1ents of thickness of the bed were those obtained in the Yellow Pine mine, where they range fron1 70 to 120 feet. This bed contains all the ore bodies in the Yellow Pine and Prairie Flower n1ines.
The basal sandstone of the Bird Spring formation crops out near the Yellow Pine mine and on the Snowstorm claims, 'vhere it contains lenses of chert con-
glomerate (p. 22). In the Yellow Pine 1nine it is a
fine-grained pale yellowish-brown sandstone without traces of bedding. In the southern part of that 1nine it is 28 feet thick, but it becomes thinner northward, and on the Snows.torm claims, where it contains lenses of conglomerate (p. 110), the total thickness is less than 20 feet. In the workings· of the Hale and Prairie· Flower shafts it is represented by black sandy clay, or locally by cobblestones, and the thickness is in places no nwre than 2 feet. Doubtless where it is thin it has been sheared during c01npression. It was not observed at the proper horizon near the Middlesex nnne.
The beds that normally overlie the basal sandstone of the Bird .Spring formation are thin-bedded limestones, largely less than 10 feet thick, and interbedded shales and sandstones (p. 22). They crop out conspicuously fr01n the Yellow Pine mine northward nearly to the Red Cloud 1nine and again fron1 the Snowstorm northward for several 1niles. They are sporadically altered to coarsely crystalline dolon1ite for a distance of several hundred feet above the Yellow Pine sill of porphyry, but locally li1nestone is preserved within 20 feet of it. Near the Middlesex mine and farther south, where the sill is thinner or absent, the beds are only here and there altered to a finegrained dolomite.
Intrusive rocks.-In studying the local structural history it will be helpful to recognize five bodies of intrusiv~ granite porphyry in the area-the Yellow Pine sill, the Snowstorm sill, the 11iddlesex sill, the Alice dike, and the Yellow Pine dike.
·The outcrop of the Yellow Pine sill underlies the largest area of CO!lrse intrusive rocks in the region. It lies west of the Yellow Pine mine and is struck at many places underground. Southwest of the mine it has a 1naximum thickness of about 780 feet, and the

of these are shown on Plate 1. Of these only two, the Ninety-nine and North Ninety-nine appear to be con-· tinuous through the Keystone fault into the underlying Contact block. The seven faults southwest of the Ninety-nine fault appear to drop the south sides and probably represent local shearing during the epoch of thrust faulting.
That part of the 1\.:eystone block which lies between Potosi Wash on the north and. the Ironside fault on the south forn1s a structural unit sharply set off from the region southeast of the Ironside fault.. Broadly the area of thin dolmnite beds of the Goodsprings formation is a~1ticlinal; in detail it is broken by n1any small faults and several large faults without distinctive pattern. (See pis. 1 and 2.) Probably these faults repre·sent the local shifts of 1nasses of thin-bedded weak 1·ocks along the crest of an anticline caused by compression at the time the thrust.faults were formed.
The belt of rocks southwest of 1Ceystone Wash and northwest of the Ironside fault includes two simple anticlines and an intervening syncline in lower Paleozoic rocl\:s. The western anticline is well shown near the Ironside n1ine, where the beds on the east limb are vertieal. The Boss mine explores a mineralized fault zone that trends northwest and merge~ with the Ironside fault. This fault shows many horizontal grooves and striae; and the conclusion is reached that the Iron:side fault was forn1ed during the epoch of thrust faults~ It seems clear that the 1\.:eystone overthrust is offset by the Ironside fault, which, however, probably does not ·extend downward into the beds of the Contact block. ThQ. sharp folds with northeast trend on the northwest side of the Ironside fault contrast sharply with the broad syncline with eastward trend on the southeast side.
Several hills in this part of the ~eystone block are capped by masses of cemented lin1estone and dolomite blocks whose origin is obscure. The· large hill and several s1naller hills in the vV. }~ sec. 2, T. 24 S., R. 57 E., are n1ade up of such material, as is also that at
the 1nouth of Keystone Wash, in the NW. X sec. 24,
T. 24 S., H. 57 E. The blocks are wholly angular and, although ce1nented by dense calcite, weather free and fonn a talus around the base of the hill. Most of thmn range fronl 1 to 5 feet· in dianleter, but some are 10 feet. They include n1aterials found throughout the upper Paleozoic forn1ations. The idea was first entertained that they were breccias related to overthrust faults, but this was abandoned in favor of the belief that, like the cen1ented wash in the northeast corner of the quadrangle, they represent waste frmn the near-by higher hills. (See p. 41.)
That part of the Keystone block which extends from the Ironside fault southeastward to the southern border/of the quadrangle is stl'ucturally very complex. It may be regarded as separable into two Slnaller parts, roughly divided by the Fredrickson fault, which extends southeastward 4 miles from the n1ine of

that name and westward along the road to Ripley.

The rocks that lie north and northeast of this fault are

'folded into a sharp anticline and syncline that become

open folds westward toward the Boss mine. These

folds are broken by two groups of faults, one group,

near the Kirby mine, trending nearly at right angles to.

the axes of the folds, and the other, only two of which

are shown, roughly parallel to the Fredrickson fault.

Mineralization was noted at some place on almost

every fault of these two groups, and ore bodies have

been explored on several, such as the Rose and Kirby.

Probably all are premineral. The faults that cut

across the folds at right angles appear to represent

minor slips developed late in the epoch of overthrust

faulting.

The Fredrickson fault is uncommonly interesting.

It can be traced for more than a mile near the mine by

a reef of dolomite breccia 20 to 50 feet wide and locally

as much as 25 feet high. It probably passes by the

mouth of the southern tunnel of the Argentena group,

as the cut at the entrance shows 20 feet of ce1nented

breccia. It is in<;-onspicuous near the Lookout n1ine

except by the offset of beds but is marked by a reef of
breccia for a mile south of the Mounta'in Top n1ine.

Throughout this course of 4 miles the dip is 60° to 75°

SW. At the Fredrickson mine it turns abruptly west,

and its outcrop coincides with the local bedding of the

Goodsprings dolomite. Northwest of the Argentena

mine the southwest side of the fault has· dropped

relative to the northeast, the apparent dip slip attain-

ing a maximum of 400 feet near the Fredrickson n1ine,

but south of the Argentena mine the northeast side has

·dropped about 100 feet. From the Mountain Top

mine southeast, however, the· southwest side has

dropped. There is extensive dolomitization of the

rocks on bo.th sides of the fault, and although no ore

deposits have been mined on it many have been

explored within 800 feet of it in a distance of 3 miles.

Even though for most of its outcrop it shows the

relations of a normal fault, a more satisfactory explana-

tion would assume that it is a transcurrent fault

forn1ed during the thrust epoch by the movement of

the southwest side nortP,west, almost horizontally.

West of the Fredrickson mine it probably becomes a

bedding-plane thrust fault.

The northward-trending fault a 1nile west of Colmn-

bia Pass displaces both the 1Ceystone and Contact

thrusts near the Ruth mine (p. 139) and is mineralized

at the Cosmopolitan mine. An alternative explana-

tion might -relate this fault and the Fredrickson fault

by assmning that both are thrust faults along which

the movement is largely horizontal. This fault and

two others parallel to it near Kirby Wash are regarded

as the types of "early normal, premineral faults" in

the region. (Seep. 93·.)

'

In the vicinity of Crystal :Pass there are two faults

that trend northwest and dip steeply southwest.

MINOR STRUCTURAL FEATURES

Although not susceptible of proof in all places, it is commonly believed that a block of older rocks that rests upon underlying younger rocks has moved over upon those younger rocks,. which have remained relatively, if not actually, fixed in position. For this reaso~1 the separating fault is called an overthrust. It is the commonly accepted belief, although debatable, that in such regions there was an active pressure from the direction of rp.ovement of the overriding block which met a resistance from the direction of the overridden block. In some regions, such as southern Nevada, where the large overthrust faults dip almost uniformly in one direction-:-that is, west to southwest-there are some flat faults. which separate older rocks above fron1 the younger rock below and which dip in a direction opposite to the rest-that is, east to northeast. Such faults are termed . underthrusts, although it is not demonstrable that the underlying young rocks have actually been pushed under a fixed overlying block. Such underthrust faults occur in

The top of the Lavina dike coincides with the Contact overthrust, and the dike is clearly later than the fault. There is a series of dikes of this same rock that roughly follow the Keystone overthrust from th~ Keystone mine to Crystal Pass, about 7 miles southeast. These dikes lie in diverse attitudes with respect to the overthrust surface, and the largest, at the Keystone mine, abuts against it. It seems that all these bodies were intruded in the n1idst of the tlp:ust epoch but before the sulphide Ininerali7.ation of tho region.
Most of the postmineral faults near Porter Wash do not disturb the flows of Table Mountain, although these as well as the flows near the Sultan mine are. broken by s1nall faults. East of I vanpah Valley, however, enormous normal faults have been formed since the surface lavas were poured out.

AGE OF STRUCTURAL EVENTS
As there are no fossil- bearing beds or persistent strata in the region younger than the Aztec sandstone,
of Jurassic(?) age,.it is not possible to place precisely the
age of the structural events described above, and it will be necessary to draw inferences from the lmowledge of the history of near-by regions. On the basis of his work in the Muddy Mountains, 55 miles northeast of Goodsprings, Longwell 52 concluded that the folds and overthrust faults of that region were late 11esozoic • and that the region was exposed to great erosion during late Mesozoic and early Tertiary time. The gravel, limestone, magnesite, gypsun1, tuff, and borax-bearing beds that make up the Overton fangloxnerate and Horse Spring formation were considered to be Miocene on the basis of their similarity to the Esn1eralda (Siebert)

formation of western Nevada. These beds in the Muddy Mountains are greatly deformed but overlap the folded Jurassic and earlier beds and tlie overthrust faults of the at·ea. Later work by Stock 63 led to the conclusion that slightly disturbed beds near Panaca, 145 miles north of Goodsprings, are probably Plioc~ne, whereas the flat beds of Muddy Valley, between Logan and Ovet·ton, which unconforn1ablyoverlie the Overton and Horse Spring beds; are probably slightly older than the Panaca fonnation. In both these regions the Tertiary beds were laid down on a surface erod.ed in the folded Paleozoic and Mesozoic formations but have scarcely been disturbed since they were deposited. · On the basis of work in the western part of the Mohave Desert, 160 1niles southwest of Goodsprings, Baker 54 concluded that the widely separated groups of heds 1nade up of volcanic ash, lava flows, limestone, gypsum, and borate minerals and given the name "Rosamond series," are upper Miocene. Later Merriam,55 summarizing field work and study of these beds from 1911 to 1918, especially near Barstow and Ricardo, concluded that they do not represent one great period of accumulation of sediments but include beds. that range in age from upper Miocene to lower Pliocene. Like the Horse Spring formation, these beds are highly folded.
Beds of sandstone, tuff, and dit1tomaceous earth considered to be a part of the Estneralda formation, of Miocene age, have been recognized by Ball 56 and Ransome 57 in many parts of southwestern Nevada. Although bwken by faults in many places, these beds are in general nearly horizontal. ~n a few places, such as the Funeral Mount'ains and Pahute Mesa, they dip as 1nuch as 30°, or even 60°, but are not folded. In these areas, however, except for certain coarse-grained g1·anitic t·ocl\:s, inferred to have been intruded between the Jurassic and Tertiary, none of the pre-Tertiary rocks that underlie the Esmeralda· formation in southwestern Nevada are younger than Pennsylvanian. It can only be said with assurance, therefore, that the folds, overthrusts, and premineral faults of the Goodsprings area are post-Jurassic and pre-Miocene. These data would indicate that the granitic intrusions are probably late Jurassir. and therefore allied to. those of thfl Rierra Nevada.
Feo1n another standpoint, however, the folds, overthrust faults, and porphyry intrusions appear to be younger, possibly late Cretaceous or early' Tertiary.

In Utah, Arizona, Colorado, and New Mexico numerous masses of granitic rocks were certainly intruded in late Cretaceous or early Tertiary time. T.o quote Lindgren: 58
There are very many smaller batholiths [than those of Idaho and Boulder, Mont.], stocks; and laccoliths scattered through Montana, Nevada, Colorado, Utah, New Mexico, and Arizona; they .are almost always quartz monzonites or granodiorites, in places grading into more acid alaskites, and are often intruded
in late Cretaceous beds. * * * In Arizona the same condi-
tions prevail-for instance, at Clifton, where rocks ranging from diorite porphyry to granite porphyry are intruded in Cretaceous and lower strata .·at Globe, Bisbee, Silver Bell, Bradshaw Mountains, Harquahala and Wallapai Mountains, and many other places. In the latter three cases the age of the intrusives is uncertain. At Bisbee granite porphyry· was intruded previously to the early Cretaceous, and many ·of the Arizona ·intrusives may be of earlier age than those farther north.
Also the evidence is increasing that there is an extensive belt of overthrust faults that extends from northern Montana southeastward into western Wyoming {tnd eastern Idaho and Utah. In some places these have been proved to be early Eocene and in others· later ·Eocene. The belt of overthrusts of southern Nevada appears to be the southern extension of those known farther north and may have the same age. At present the writer favors this interpretation.
The tuffs and flows of Table Mountain and the area ne~r the Sultan In;ine, as well as the intrusive masses of Diablo Grande Peak, are considered to be related in age to the upper Miocene and Pliocene volcanic rocks of southern Nevada.59
ROCK ALTERATION
GENERAL FEATURES
Very few sedimentary rocks now exposed at the surface or in shallow mine workings have the same prop·ertie's that they had when they were deposited. Most of them have un<;Iergone consolidation or hardening to a degree that depends largely upon the depth to which they were buried and the stresses they have undergone when subsequently folded. Commonly changes in color, hardness, cementing material, or mineral constitution have taken place, the particular changes depending largely .on the chemical character and temperature of the water that has moved through them since they were consolidated. Even where it is apparent that great changes in composition or constitution have occurred and it seems clear that these have been accomplished by the water that has circulated through the rocks, it is difficult or impossible to determine the source of the water,. the reasons for such changes, and the time when they took place.

56 GEOLOGY AND ORE DEPOSITS OF GOODSPRINGS QUADRA.NCLE, NEVADA

In this region the sandstone and shale have unde.l_'gone some changes since they were deposited, but these are slight compared with the changes undergone by the carbonate rocks, limestone, and dolomite. The mottled dolomitic limestones of the Goodsprings formation are considered to represent rearrangements or changes in composition shortly after burial, but these as well as the younger limestones have undergone later widespread alteration ·to pure dolomite. This alteration appears to have taken place much more recently, in late Cretaceous or early Tertiary time or later, and to be related to the intrusion of bodies of igneous rocks, in large part the coarse-grained orthoclase porphyry but also to less degree the fine-grained later rhyolites. Although not confined to the ore-bearing ~reas, dolomitized limestone surrounds most of the ore deposits, and the two appear to be related. For these reasons the alterations will be grouped according to their apparent association with the coarse-grained or fine-grained intrusive rocks.
Alteration of the rocks by surface weathering IS . meager in this region and will not be considered.
ROCK ALTERATIONS RELATED TO EARLY TERTIARY
COARSE-GRAINED INTRUSIVE ROCKS
Four varieties of alteration of the limestones and dolomites have been observed in this region in the vicinity of dikes and sills of granite porphyry-garnetization, serpentinization, silicification, and dolomitization.
GARNETIZATION
In a small area southeast of the Lavina 1nine, in the south-central part of sec. 21, T. 24 S., R. 58 E., magnesian limestone and dolomite, probably a part of the ~tfoenkopi formation, are locally altered to a mottled brownish rock made up of gar:J?.et and quartz. From tests of the index of refraction the garnet is probably andradite, the magnesium-calcium-iron· garnet. A thin section of the rock shows microgranular garnet with here and there a druse lined with coarser crystals and filled with quartz. There are also a few quartz veinlets that cut across the garnet groundmass. The a.real extent of garnet rock is only a few acres, and it is bounded·on the east, north, and west by the Lavina dike. Even where the carbonate rock is completely altered to garnet, the bedding is preserved. The area is limited southward by the Ruth fault.
Garnet rock was not observed in any other locality in the region. Probably it is completely absent on the border of the Yellow Pine sill as well as along its· northern extension on the Snowstorm claims and its southern extension near the Middlesex Inine. None was observed near the Keystone and Boss extension dikes nor the small dikes near Crystal Pass. Clearly considerable silica has been added to the carbonate roek near the Lavina mine in order to convert it into

garnet. The small ·wedge of garnet rock was undoubtedly subjected to a higher temperature than those masses of rock whose surfaces of contact with the porphyry were planes.
A fragment of a small boulder picked up by H. Hardy in the wash near the Blue Jay mine, in the west-central part of sec. 9, T. 24 S., R. 58 E., proved on exa.mination under the microscope to be largely tremolite 'vith a little magnetite. This mineral is commonly found in or near carbonate rocks that have been affected by intrusive rocks or by regional metamorphism, but it has not been found in place anywhere in the entire region. It is difficult to account for the presenee of trenwlite in this locality, unless, like the boulders that cap the hill near the Red Cloud mine, .it has been brought by ancient streams from a region northwest of this quadrangle. The nearest intrusive rocks are the Red Cloud dike and the sill on the Snowstorn1 claims, but no silicate minerals were found either on the surface or underground in these localities.
SERPENTINIZATION AND FERRATION
In the SE. X sec. 2, T. 25 S., R. 58 E., sout"Pwest of
Crystal Pass, a dike of normal granite porphyry crops out in several gulches. It probably is about 1,000 feet long and 40 feet wide. It cuts across the Sultan limestone, and the alterations here described have taken place in dolomitized Valentine limestone. The dike trends north and is vertical; the adjacent dolomite trends north and dips gently west. On the west side of the dike there is a belt 400 feet wide and on the east side a similar belt 150 feet wide, within which the dolomite displays n;any cracks, along which a brownish mineral is developed by replacing the dolomite. (See pl. 17, A.) The brown mineral is very fine grained, even more so than the dolomite which it replaces, and it resembles a common variety of siderite. Analyses by J. G. Fairchild, of the United States Geological Survey, show that it is a dolomite which, howevert contains 0.44 per cent of iron. It closely resembles the brown material found around the borders of the basalt
dike in the SW. Xsec. 30, T. 24 S., R.-58 E., which an
analysis shows to be a dolomite to which a little iron and water have been added. (See analysis 15b, p. 62.) Sporadically within the belt, but particularly in areas near the dike, there are veins and masses of pale-green serpentine that is uniformly in contact with the brown mineral and nowhere in contact with unaltered doloInite. Son1e masses of serpentine are 6 inches or more in diameter, but the veins are smaller. The loqal relations indicate that the intrusion of the dike has caused the circulation of water, which has brought. about the addition of the iron to the dolomite and the addition of silica and water to the iion-bearing dolomite, for serpentine is an iron-bea.ring hydrous silicate of magnesia.

SILICIFICATION
In contrast with what has been observed in 1nany mining districts, the mnount of silica added to the rocks n.nd ore deposits in this quadrangle is small. The outcrop and upper weathered zone of a nun1ber of oro deposits contain a little silica in the forn1 of ferruginous chert, and a few (Kirby, Tam o' Shanter, and others) contain a large quantity, but this is clearly related to surface processes (p. 83). At only a few deposits is there appreciable silica, either in the ore body or in the wall rock, which has assuredly been deposited at the tin1e of ore deposition (Yellow Pine mine, p. 129; Doubleup, p. 109; Boss, p. 114; and John, p. 144).
Silicification of the country rock is found only here and there and in slight degree. It is not possible to discriminate with great confidence the places where it is related to deep-seated processes fron1 those where it 1nay be related to surface processes. It seems probo.ble that the coarsely crystalline clear varieties of quartz have a hypogene origin and that the· finegrained iron-stained varieties are supergene. In speci-
m.en Sb from the Bird Spring formation in the E: X
sec. 32, T. 24 S., R. 58 E., an analysis of which appears in the table on page 61, the percentage of insoluble matter, largely silica, is 7.32, whereas the original limestone has n~ne. When this specin1en was polished and etched, it was found that the silica is clear, .coarsely crystalline quartz that fills cavities bounded by terminated crystals of dolomite-the same relations that surround the occurrence of clear calcite in many pln.ces. Even though the specimen occurred on the surface, the opinion is held that the silica had a hypogene origin. The wall rock of the Doubleup mine is a similar dolon1ite with clear quartz in the same relations but also in part replacing' the dolomite.
Silicification by chert, apparently deposited by surface waters, is described on page 82.

DOLOMITIZATION

Jt'IELD UELATIONS OF DOLOMITIZED LIMESTONES

Only a brief acquaintance with the rocks of this

region is required to show clearly that many large

masses of limestone have been converted' to dolomite.

Not until a con1prehensive study is made, however,

do the extent of the alteration and the relations of

the dolomite become apparent. Even such a study

len.ves nruch to be desired in an attempt to determine

tho manner by which the alteration has been accom-

plished and the source of the magnesia.

.

Beds affectecl.-The limestones of frOJn the oldest to the upper part

all the of the

BfoirrdmaStpiorinnsg'

fonnn.tion, are locally altered to dolon1ite. Some beds

ns much as 300 feet thick are completely altered over

ln.rgc m·eas; others are only slightly altered in small

areas. It will aid in understanding the problem if

the behavior of each sliccessive formation toward alteration is stated.
The Goodsprings dolOinite forms a belt that extends from the northern to the southern bounda.ry of the quadrangle and app~ars originally to have been made up of alternating thin layers of fine-grained 1nagnesian limestone and dolomite. (See analysis 14, p. 62.) In several places, such as the areas aroLmd Devil Canyon, east of Porter V\7ash, from the Whale and Sn1ithsonite mines east to Columbia Pass, west of Little Devil Peak, and west of Wilson Pass, the finegrained bluish-gray beds are altered to nwdiumgrained crystalline smoky-gray dolo1nite. In contrast, beds in a si1nilar position in the section near the I{eystone mine a~d northward from Potosi Wash are unaltered. The entire thickness of beds exposed at the mouth of Devil Canyon-1,375 feet--and above the Lincoln nline-1,300 feet-is medium-grained dolomite, hut farther northwest only the upper 500 to 800 feet of the Goodsprings formation has this texture and composition. The conclusion seen1s clear that the fine-grained rocks which contained. less n1agnesia than that required by dolomite have acquired, subsequent to deposition, additional nutgnesia and become m.ore coarsely crystalline. . There is a general but not a close coincidence between the areas of the Goodsprings forrr1ation that have been dolomit"i1.ed and the distribution of mineral deposits. Sporadic mineral deposits .oecur from Kirby Wash eastward and south to Devil Canyon, but they are almost entirely absent north of Potosi Wash.
The Sultan formation was originally rather pure limestone, separable into three members on the basis of distinctive color or features of bedding-the Ironside, Valentine, and Crystal Pass limestones (p. 13). These three mmnbers have responded in a different manner t'o the process of dolomitization. The lowest member, the Iro.riside dolomite: has been so con1pletely altered that only in two 8mall area.s ha.ve residual masses of limestone been preserved in it-on the west slope of Little Devil Peak and in sec. 34, T. 23 S., R. 57 E. Such fossils as this dolon1ite yields have been preserved through silicification on the surface, so that

in the region, the color was preserved after it was altered to dolonute. The middle member of the Sultan formation, the Valentine limestone, made up of beds of liinestone 5 to 30 feet thick, preserves its character throughout most of the region north of Wilson Pass. In the vicinity of the Boss mine the beds show sporadic. alteration, but from the Ironside fault eastward and southward as far as Crystal Pass these beds are completely altered to dolomite. From Porter Wash southward and from Singer Wash southward, dolonlitization is only sporadic. Plate 17, B, shows an irregular n1ass of limestone in the Valentine limestone bounded

in sees. 3 and 4, T. 26 S., R. 58 E., and the large, much fractured anticline in beds of the Goodsprings formation-the beds have been thoroughly dolomitized. Although these areas are not remote from normal and thrust -faults, the alteration appears to be more closely related to brecciation coincident with the general deformation of the beds than the faults.
In detail, the process of dolomitization proceeded outward from fractures and minor partings parallel to the bedding, but here and there the fractures are very obscure. The outer limit is generally very irregular (fig. 12), although in some places it is marked by fractures also. (See pl. 17, B.) Thus, in the occurrence shown. in Plate 19, B, a dense limestone has been broken by numerous diagonal fractures, from which dolomitization has proceeded outward along the bedding. The b~dding is actually faulted, but close examination shows that the movement preceded the alteration. In the areas shown in Plate 18, A, persistent major fractures trend northeast, and the dolomitized mass is roughly lenticular, although dolomitization locally followed certain beds and left others unattacked. In the same area nearly tabular vertical masses that cut scross a number of beds are dolomitized. In many places the altered mass is small and its relations to fractures are clear (fig. 11), but elsewhere it is so large that its relations are obscure.
As set forth on page 54, the following order of events in this :region has been determined: Folding, beginning of thrust faulting, intrusion of coarse igneous rocks, conclusion of thrust faulting, early normal faulting, late normal faulting, intrusion and extrusion of finegrained igneous rocks, minor normal faulting. When the problem of dolomitization is viewed in the light of these successive events, it seems clear that the process. has some relation to coarse igneous rocks, to the later of the thrust faults, to the early normal faults, and, in a very in'>ignificant degree, to the fine-grained intrusive rocks. It is clear that the alteration began after the intrusion of the dikes and sills of granite porphyry, attained its maxin1um development shortly after the thrust faults were cornpleted, and then rapidly died out, although it was not over before the early normal faulting took .place. The relation of dolomitization to the deposition of metallic slilphides is discussed on pages 100-101.
Changes in color and te3:ture accompanying dolom,itization.-In the tables on pages 61-62 brief descriptions of the color and texture of the analyzed specimens of limestone and dolomite 'are presented. Generally, the change from limestone to dolomite has been accompanied by a change in color; here and there very little change in color has taken place, as in specimens 11a and 11b. For the most part the darker (more carbonaceous?) limestones, such as the Iro.nside dolomite member of the Sultan formation, do not show any great change in color, but they form a small part of the total. The bluish-gray limestones have

commonly changed to crearn-colored doio1nites (pl. 18,

B); only in a few places is the resulting dolon1ite white.

Undoubtedly the change in color depended largely

on the elimination of carbonaceous matter and the

addition of iron compounds, which weathered to one

of the hydrous oxides near the surface and yielded a

light-brown color. The veinlets of bituminous matter

in the Azurite mine probably represent local concen-

trations of such material driven out of the liinestone

during dolomitization.

Where the beds are unaffected by dolomitization

the freshly broken limestones of the Sultan and Monte

Cristo formations and most of the Bird Spring forma-

tion almost uniformly have the fine homogeneous

texture of porcelain; here and there some beds of the

Bird Spring formation contain a few crystalline grains

of calcite. · Beds that are largely made up of coarsely

crystalline calcite grains are very rare. In thin sec-

tion the limestones present diverse aspects. Some are

made up largely of minute unbroken organic re1nains

and contain few fragments, whereas in others the re-

verse is·true. The limestone in the Bird Spring forma-

tion shown in Plate 20, A, consists in large part of

minute foraminifers and bryozoans, many of which

do not exceed 0.05 millimeter in diameter. In a thin

section of this rock P. V. Roundy identified fragments

are also present. Another lin1estone about 500 feet

above the base of the Bird Spring formation, a thin

section of which is reproduced in Plate 21, A, contains

more fossil fragments, and both Bryozoa (Stenopora

sp.) and Foraminifera (Oristellaria? sp. and Fus?.tli-

nella? sp.) have been identified. Angular grains of

quartz sand are present in both limestones.

The crystal grains of dolon1ite resulting from the

alteration of limestone show a wide range in size,

roughly from 0.1 to 15 rnillimeters. The cause of this

wide range is not known. The most coarsely crystal-

line dolomite is found in the region north of Wood

Gulch and east of the range, where the massive Yellow-

pine.limestone is locally altered to nearly pure dolo-

mite (analysis 13, p. 61). Here the average size of

grain is about 8 millimeters. In the vicinity of many

ore bodies, such as that of the Yellow Pine rnine, the

average size of grain is about 1.5 millimeters, regardless

of the beds in which 'they lie. The texture of the Bul-

lion dolomite is very uniform, and the grains average·

about 0.5 millimeter. In several localities, where the

beds from 200 to 800 feet above the base of the Bird

Spring formation have been converted to dolon1ite, as

in the areas east and south of Wilson Pass and north-

east of Wood Gulch, the texture of the resulting rock

is very fine; probably the average size of the grains is

0.1 n1illimeter.

·

In general, the finer the grain of the dolon1ite the

less is its difference in color from that of the original

limestone. Thus, the fine-grained dolomites are

comrnonly light to n1ediuni gray; some are nearly

89. 761 Crushed dolomite of Bird Spring formation.

a Collected and analyzed by E. J. Longyear & Co.

Except as indicated the analyses were made by J. G. Fairchild, of the United States Geological Survey, and the methods used were those described by Hillebrand.60 In these methods the powdered rock is dissolved in hydrochloric acid (1 part of acid to 3 parts of water); material designated "insoluble" in the analyses is the ignited residue after filtering the solution. The iron oxide and al:umina reported represent tha.t· which is soluble in hydrochloric .acid; any that may have been present in the insoluble residue was not determined.

Survey Bull. 700, pp. 246-~52, 1919.

·

The analyses of the unaltered limestones confirm the impression obtained by tests in the field that .they are uncommonly pure and free from magnesia and insoluble matter. The ~ighest percentage of magnesia is 2.84, which indicates 12.98 per cent of the dolomite molecule (No. 6a). This specimen has been polished and etched with dilute hydrochloric acid (1 part of acid to 1 of water). This treatment .reveals the presence of irregular grains of dolomite sporadically distributed througJwut the groundmass, and the ratio of dolomite to calcite confirms the impression obtained throughout this investigation that all the
magnesia ill the limestone is present as distinct grains

this respect the calcite resembles the secondary quartz, with which, in fact, it is here and there associated. The analyses made by the E. J. Longyear Co. show that the process of dolomitization persisted to considerable depths near ore deposits and was not in any sense an alteration related to the present surface or to circulation of local surface waters.
Change in volume.-In many localities in this region there is abundant evidence that the process of alteration of limestone to dolomite has not involved any appreciable change in volume of the original rock. In some places hand specimens, such as that illustrated in Plate 19, B, show crystals and crystalline masses·of dolomite that have grown without producing any distortion of the bedding of the near-by limestone. Dolomitized fossils- do not show any distortion. ·Also, in many localities wedge-shaped masses of dolomite bounded by minor joints project into masses of limestone without involving distortion of the limestone. (See pl. 17, B.) Finally, on a larger scale, as in the locality shown in Figure 12, there is no difference between the thickness of a bed of limestone and its ad-

jacent dolomitized equivalent. It is a fundamental concept of the process of dolomitization in this area that it has been accomplished without change in the volume of the original rock.
Gains and los8es of material.-Most processes of rock alteration involve gains or losses of material, and it is interesting as a 1neasure of the degree of alteration to know the quantities that are involved. In the present investigation it became readily apparent that large quantities of magnesia have been gained by the rocks and that similar large quantities of lime have been lost. · ·
In order to calculate gains and losses of rocks that have been altered without change of volum~ there must be obtained, first, analyses of the unaltered rock and of the altered product; second, the specific gravity of the original rock and of the altered product, both free of pore space; and third, the porosity of the original rock and of the altered product. These data have been obtained for six pairs of specimens, and the results, as well as the calculated gains and losses of materials, are presented in the following table.

In making these calculations the following procedure was used: Where the sum of the percentages of the ingredients exceeded 100, each was corrected proportionately, so that the total should be 100. For the determinations of the density of the rock powders the writer is indebted to Mr. A. F. Melcher, formerly of the United States Geological Survey, who also gave many helpful suggestions concerning procedures in determining the porosity of large specimens.64 The unused portions of the powdered specimens used in the chemical analyses were dried at 110° C. for 24 hours, and approximately 5-gram samples were weighed out and placed in weighted pycnometers. To these distilled water was added while the pressure was kept teduced to about 700 millimeters. Then the filled pycnometers were held at 29.45° C. for two hours before weighing.· The weight of the sample divided by the weight of the displaced water yields the density at 29.45° C.
To make determinations of porosity specimens were held at 108° C. for 48 hours and at 165° C. for 24 hours, and then, after cooling, weighed as recorded in the table. Each specimen was then dipped in melted paraffin and after cooling was reweighed, the difference showing the weight of the paraffin coating. Later, aftAr weighing the specimens in water, it was a simple matter to calculate the volume of the coated specimen, and then, from the density of the powder, to determine the percentage of pore space. In the table the porosity is expressed in percentage of the total volume. The range in porosity of the six specimens of limestone is from 0.361 to 1.49 per cent and of the six dolomites fron1 1.690 to 3.201 per cent. The porosity of the dolomites is from 2 to 4 times that of the corresponding limestones, and there is a tendency fot the ·n10st porous lin1estone to yield the most porous dolomite. Curiously, the porosity of the limestones is higher than one would suspect from casual examination, and that of the dolomites is lower, although
a• Melcher, A. 1~.• Dctcrmlnntlon of pore space or oil and gas sands: Mining and
Metnllurgy, No. 160, April, 1920.

both are lower than in most specimens of such rocks. If the calcite in the dolomites were removed or had not been deposited, the porosity of the dolomites would be appreciably higher. If 5 per cent of .calcite · were represented by pore space, it would be equivalent to a porosity of 1.841 per cent; similarly 10 per cent of calcite would equal a porosity of 3.688 per cent. Under such an assumption, the porosity of the dolomites would range from 2.632 per cent (No. lOb) to 6.618 per cent (No. 12b).
In a broad way, the field evidence indicates that the pore spa(fe is rather uniformly distributed through the dolomites, but in hand specimens 3 or 4 inches long it is irregularly distributed. Determinations on specimens weighing less th~n 100 grams would probably be slightly misleading. In most specimens cavities that range from 0.5 to 1.0 milli1neter in diameter are present, but only a few are larger; undoubtedly most of the pore space is represented by smaller cavities.
These calculations show that when the limestone wa.s altered to dolomite it lost lime and gained magnesia and carbon dioxide. The loss in lime was about 40 per cent of that present in the limestone. Inasmuch as the gain in magnesia coincided with a gain in carbon dioxide, it is concluded that the solutions which brought in the magnesia contained carbon dioxide and that the magnesia was prese.nt as the bicarbonate rather than any other compound. The following equation expresses the replacement of a volume of calcjte (1,000 cubic centimeters) by an equal volume of dolomite: 1,000 cubic centimeters (2,715 grams) of CaC03 (a
solid) +443 cubic centimeters (1,313 grams) of MgC03 in solution= 1,000 cubic centimeters (2,870 grams) of CaMgC03 (a solid) +426 cubic centimeters (1,158 grams) of CaC03 in solution. This equation represents an ideal condition that is probably not attainable in na.ture because it does not provide for porosity or any residual calcite. The analyses in the table on pages 61-62 probably represent average condj tions in this field.

66 GEOLOGY AND ORE DEPOSITS OF GOODSPRINGS QUADRANGLE, NEVADA

'l'he specimens that were tested yield inconclusive results concerning the gain or loss of silica. The examination of thin sections as well as polished sections of specimens lOa, lOb, lla, llb, and 12b shows that all the silica is present as subangular grains of quartz and that none resembles the secondary silica Teferred to on page 57. Actually, two pairs of the .analyses (lOa and lOb, lla and llb) show slight losses ·of silica, and the third (12a and 12b) shows an appre·ciable gain. The evidence justifies the conclusion that these differences reflect original variations in the sand content of the limestones and do not indieate gains or losses of silica during alteration. The questions of the addition of silica during dolomitization and its recent migration and rearrangement as. a result of weathering are further considered under Ore deposits (p. 98).
Manner of replacement.-At this place the probable significance of the foregoing data is briefly summarized, ·so far as it bears upon the rna.nner of replacement of the limestone by dolomite. A comparison of the structure of the limestone with that of dolomite shows that except for a few fossils the n1inute texture of the limestone is destroyed and coarser dolomite crystals have taken its place. It seems significant that the calcite which remains in the dolomite is limpid ~lear, is free from inclusions, and does not possess any of the features of the limestone that originally occupied the space. It therefore does not appear that the terminated dolomite crystals which adjoin the calcite areas were replacing the limestone molecule by molecule but rather that· the limestone was being dissolved slightly in advance of the growing dolomite crystals and that when their growth was con1plete there rernained several per cent of pore space, which was later filled up by the calcite dissolved near by. As one of the consequences of this process, the porosity of any part of the mass would be a minin1um at the beginning, attain a· maximum at the end of dolomitization, and then decrease rapidly when the pores finally filled up with the eliminated calcite.
The principal channels of access of magnesiumbearing solutions undoubtedly were faults, fractures, and bedding planes. Considering the degree ot alteration of large bodies of rock, 'the fractures· seem few and widely spaced. Certainly, in many places there are masses of dolomite 5 to 10 feet or nwre from a conspicuous fracture. This condition is repeatedly shown in the area represented by Plate 18, A. If it is general, the active circulation which produced alteration probably took place along a few fractures, and any liquids that permeated the rocks moved very sluggishly, if at all. It would follow that dissolved magnesium carbonate was transferred from the fractures into the rock by diffusion rather than bv a~tive

circulation of water. Simila;rly, the ealciun1 carbonate was diffused outward to the fissures and then on to the surface.
Source of the magnesia.-Dolomites have been observed and studied in n1any parts of the world under many circumstances, and various explanations. have been offered to account for the source of the magnesia and the manner of its introduction into carbonate rock. The problem has been well summarized by Van Tuyl,65 although his attention was largely directed to the processes ·of dolon1itization retnote from ore deposits.
The writer has reeently reviewed the literature on dolomitization near ore deposits 66 and attempted to evaluate the possible sources of the magnesia which produced the alteration. Five general sources deserve consideration-(!) the waters of the sea, (2) the shell of sedimentary rocks, (3) the underlying crystalline rock complex, (4) the shallow intrusions in the crust, parts of which are revealed by erosion, and (5) the deeper magma reservoirs from which the shallow intrusive rocks have been derived.
1. As the result of the c]assical studies of Judd at Funafuti, it is now widely believed that the magnesia of sea water may partly replace the limestone forming on the sea bottom before burial. Also certain animals
withdraw from sea water the magn~sia in their hard
parts, but so far as known this is not sufficient. to form dolomite.57 It does not seem possible that the magnesia · of sea water is a direct source for the alterations considered here.
2. Most limestones contain sorn,e magnesia, and there are extensive beds of dolomitic limestone, not to mention other sediments, that contain considerable quantities. Many investigators believe that the. magnesia in such limestones may migrate within a short time, if not long, after burial to form segregated bodies of dolomite in the midst of limesione. Also it is believed that the magnesia that has dolomitized linlestone in some metalliferous districts was derived from bedded dolomites, having been first dissolved in some remote area and then transported by deeply migrating ground water~ The circulation imagined is essentially artesian, the source of the magnesia being near the region of intake of the water and the site of deposition being near the outlet. This explanation, advanced by Siebenthal 68 to explain the origin of the dolomite as wel1 as the zinc and lead in the Joplin· region, has much to commend it in regions where the structure of the rocks would permit an artesian circulation.

a district like Goodsprings, where the beds are highly folded and fractured, an artesian circulation of water seems highly improbable.
In s01ne regions dolomitic limestones are known to have been replaced by manganiferous iron carbonates (Leadville 69 and Red Cliff/° Colo., and Pioche, Nev.71 ) or by silica (Tintic, Utah,72 and Aspen, Colo.73) in the vicinity of ore deposits. If the beds in which dolomitization is observed are underlain by lower beds that may have undergone replacement by such manganiferous iron carbonates or silica, it seen1s probable that the magnesia Inay have migrated upward Or outward nnd produced the observed dol01nitization. In the opinion of the writer this source of magnesia deserves consideration.
3. The ancient crystnlline rocks show a wide range in co1nposition, and all contain an appreciable quantity of magnesia. The corr1mon gneisses and schists contain from 0.3 to 3.0 per cent of n1agnesia, and there are n1any varieties of less siliceous and more n1agnesian gneissic rocks. These rocks are possible sources of magnesia, but their general structure does not favor lateral circulation, and they are not widely replaced
ain such a way as to yield their magnesia. All composite
rocks break down into few simple minerals under the influence of weathering on the surface, but where they are deeply buried, a part of their ingredients is set free only by recombination or substitution through interaction with new substances.
4. The intrusive rocks exposed at the surface show a wide range of magnesia content as well as in the other constituents. Many granites and aplites contain as little as 0.2 per cent of n1agnesia; the quartz monzonites fr01n 0.3 to 2.5 per cent; the inter1nediate andesites and diorites fron1 2.0 to 5.0 per cent. A few basic rocks contain as much as 45 per cent. In most metalmining districts large masses of .intrusive rocks ·show a high degree of alteration, which is reflected by the develop1nent of new minerals. In the western United States the sericitic and propylitic types are common, and by these processes magnesia, lin1e, and some other ingredients are c01nn10n]y elin1inated. Good quantitative data of the kind and degree of alteration of the intrusives are on record for a number of districts-

Nevada City and Grass Valley, Calif.;74 Wood River, Idaho;75 Tonopah/6 Goldfield,77 and Ely/8 Nev.; and Breckenridge, Colo.79 In all but one of these districts, as well as in many more that have been less thoroughly studied, the alteration of the intrusive rock has caused the elimination of most of the magnesia that it once contained. It seems that this magnesia, driven out of the intrusive rock by its alteration, may be considered available to accomplish dolomitization of the higher limestones. It is characteristic of the intrusive porphyry of the Goodsprings district that although small in number and area of outcrops, it is widely altered by sericitization.
5. Magmatic sources of many elements that accomplish rock alteration and form ore deposits are attractive in an attempt to explain ~uch deposits, because they appear to impose no further burdens in the way of speculation or inquiry. Without doubt, magmas are the source of considerable water and some other substances, but it seems unwise to consider them the sole or principal sources of many elements until other possible sources have been carefully considered.
In the present state of knowledge of the Goodsprings district, as well as some similar districts, it seems that although magmatic sources and underlying dolomitic limestones, such as .those of the Goodsprings formation, may have been the sourca of some of the magnesia now present in the dolomitized limestone, a more productive source was the shallow masses of intrusive porphyry.

and in several places there are lenses of bleached rock 5 to 20 feet wide and 100 to 300 feet long that extend out into the limestone normal to the igneous contact. Analyses of the fresh gray limestone (16a) and of the bleached rock (16b), presented in the table on page 62, show that the former is nearly pure calcium carbonate, whereas the latter is largely dolomite that carries 6.03 per cent of insoluble ·matter. It is clear that the effect of t]:1e intrusion has been to convert the limestone to' dolomite and to add a little silica.
To a less degree a similar alteration appears to have taken plac~ around the southern border of the volcanic neck northwest of the Sultan mine, where it is in contact with limestones of the Sultan formation, -but no analyses have been made. · Hydration.-The northern part of the volcanic neck northwest of the Sultan mine is in contact with dolomitized limestone of the Monte Cristo formation, a light-gray medium-crystalline rock. Between this gray d"olomite and the intrusive rock there is a zone of finely crystalline cream-colored rock 15 to 30 feet "Wide, which, when tested with dilute hydrochloric acid, effervesces much more freely than normal dolomite. Three stages in the alteration of the dolomite are shown in Plates 22, A, B, and 23, A, which represent thin ·sections of the· materials. Tl;le outer part of the z'one is made up of normal Grystalline dolomite, along certain. cleavages .of which a very fine-grained mineral has developed. (See· pl. 22, A.) Plate 22, B, shows the next stage of alteration, where the new mineral, ·ha~ing grown along the cleavages, forms nearly half the entire mass. The· rock adjoining the intrusive neck is wholly made up of the new mineral. (See pl. 23, A~)
An analysis of the dense, most altered rock, made by J. G. Fairchild, of the United States ·Geological Survey, together with the calculated molecular ratios, is shown in the following table.

This calculation indicates that. the constitution of the material is 5CaC03.411gC03.Mg(OH)2.
The material has been examined carefully by H. E. Merwin, of the Geophysical Laboratory, Washington, who has found that it is essentially uniaxial negative, w=l.675-1.680, E=slightly lower than 1.51. These indices of refraction are close to those of dolomite. It is concluded that the rnaterial is largely dolomite;

that a part of the water is represented by brucite and a part may be occluded by the fine-grained material. It is regarded as fortuitous that the molecular ratios so closely accord with the formula given. The material dissolves rapidly in dilute acids, but this may be due to the extreme fineness of grain.
Son1e light on the nature of this alteration is derived from observations near by. At the head of the ravine
in theSE. Xsec. 18, T.-25 S., R. 58 E., there are several
areas, one as large as 200 by' 500 feet, within which the dolomite has been bleached. A specimen from one of these localities has been polished and etched; another ha.s been examined in thin section (pl. 23, B) and analyzed (No. 17, p. 62). The thin section shows a normal dolomite, partly altered to the hydrated product, with drusy cavities largely filled with calcite but in part with brucite. The brucite bears the same relation to the dolomite as the calcite widely noted in the dolonritized limestones of the region, but that calcite generally belongs to the period of the coarsegrained intrusive rocks and the brucite to the later period of the fine-grained intrusives. Hence it seems that the brucite has displaced calcite.
If iri the analysis of this rock (No. 17, p. 62) all of the water is calculated as brucite, it is found that 21.26 per cent of that mineral is present-much n10re than is shown in the thin section. It is clear that this rock contains the four nlinerals dolonute, calcite, brucite, and hydrated dolomite. A hydrous carbonate of calcium and magnesium containing 37.13 per cent.of lime, 23.75 per cent of magnesia, 32.41 per cent of carbon dioxide, and 6.63 per cent of water has been described by Fucan 80 and nam~d gajite.. The material studied came from talus under a cliff of Carboniferous limestone and dolomite in Croatia. The properties of gajite closely resemble those of the hydrated dolomite i~ the Goodsprings region, botJI. in masses as well as in thin section.
Ferration.-On page 40 there is brief reference to the zone of altered dolomite that surrounds the basalt dike in the SW. X sec. 30, T. 24 S., R. 58 E., west of the Kirby .n1ine. The dike trends N. 5° E., and the adjacent dolomites of the Goodsprings formation strike N. 70° W. and dip 40° S. The unaltered dolomite at the south end of the dike is gray and medimn crystalline. It appears to have been a magnesian limestone originally but to have been converted to a nearly pure dol01nite during the process of early Tertiary dolomitization (No. 15a, p.. 62).

A review of the field and analytical evidence on the co1nposition of the limestones and dolomites of the region leads to the conclusion that the effect of the two types of igneous rocks differs more in degree than in kind. Dolomitization that is apparently related to the intrusions of granite porphyry is widespread; that related to the Big Devil intrusion of rhyolite is local. Silicification, which. is present only to a slight extent, appears to have bee11: caused by both the early granite porphyry and the later rhyolite and basalt. Ferration, also present to a slight extent only, is associated with one dike of granite porphyry and with a dike of later basalt~ Perhaps the greatest difference in the effects of the two types of rock is concerned with hydrationthe amount of water added. The only evidence of hydration of wall rocks by granite porphyry is that indicated by the presence of serpentine in one locality. The latite intrusions have caused the addition of considerable water to s1nall areas of near-by dolomites.

reported the occurrence of lead 35 miles southwest of Las Vegas, just a short distance south of the Salt Lake and San Bernardino emigrant trail, in the vicinity of Cottonwood Springs. Nathaniel V. Jones visited the locality and returned ~1ay 11 to report a great quantity of ore exposed. The name "Potosi" was no doubt given to the locality by Jones, who in 1839, at the age of 17, lived in the Potosi lead and zinc district of southwestern Wisconsin. From Wisconsin he went to Utah and California in 1847, to Iowa in 1848, and back to Utah in 1849. In 1856 he was called by Brigham Young to open up the mines near Las Vegas.
At a n1eeting held on July 29, 1856, at Las Vegas, 15 men whose names are on record formed an association to work the mines and elected A. L. Fullmer their president. Owing to delays caused.by lack of blasting powder and provisions, no work was started until August, when Jones appeared before the Las Vegas Mission with the following letter from Brigham Young:

Unless the iron stains in the altered dolon1ite are considered evidence of the presence of pyrite in the unweathered zone, which is possible, there are no sulphide minerals related to the fine-grained intrusive

Jones, is counseled to forthwith proceed with the company to the neighborhood of the Las Vegas and to engage in manufacturing lead, and the said Bishop Jones is hereby empowered to call to his aid in the said manufacture and transportation of lead,

mined, owing to much "dry bone, blackjack, and sulphur." The efforts of Jones to smelt more ore proved futile, and several loads of the ore were shipped to Salt Lake City. After this failure to make. bullion Jones· and most of his men, with one wagon, started to make lead locations some 30 miles northwest of Las Vegas in the Amber Mountain district. In February lead prospecting was abandoned.
The history of the district, as reviewed by Lincoln,85 credits Dudd Leavitt and Isaac Grundy with the production of 5 tons of lead in 1S55 or 1856 from a furnace constructed in a fireplace at Las Vega.s and with thus beginning lead smelting in Nevada. Lincoln has probably confused Grundy's operations in the Lincoln district, Beaver County, Utah,86 with those ~arried on in the Goodsprings district. Eissler 87 credits to Grundy "in the fifties" the production in a small furnace near the Lincoln mine 88 of "the first parcel of silver-lead ore on .the Pacific coast sm.elted." Possibly Grundy attempted to smelt also some of the ore from the Potosi mines, but on account of the zinc he could not have succeeded any better than Jones.
The ea.rliest specific reference to the Potosi mine in print is probably that found in a report by J. R. N. Owen to the Commission of the United States and California Boundary Survey, .dated April 15, 1861, and quoted by Whitney 89 as follows:
Leaving this range [Providence] and proceeding northwestward across a low valley to the next range [Clark or Spring Mountains], we·enter a district in which limestone is not only the prevailing rock but appears to form entire ranges of lofty and boldly defined mountains, among which are comprised the Kingston, Mountain Spring, and Las Vegas Ranges, the latter extending farther to the northward. It is in this Mountain Spring Range that the Potosi mines, which are now exciting considerable attention (1861), are situated, a few miles south of the present Salt Lake road, on the western slope of the mountains, and several hundred feet above the level of the pl;:tin.
The first description of the Potosi deposit appears to be that by C. A. Luckhardt,90 whq examined it about 1870. At that time it was known as the Comet and was operated by the Silver State Mining Co. _It ·wa.s examined and described briefly by G. K. Gilbert 91 in 1871. According to Burchard,92 the Yellow Pine mining district wa.s organized in 1882. At that time the nearest·railroad point was Goffs (Blakes), on the Atchison, Topeka & Santa Fe Railway, about 80 miles south of Goodsprings.

· n1iles southwest of Goodsprings, there is meager record for this district. S. E. Yount went into the district in 1884 to do assessment work on the Keystone, Boss, Colun1bia, and Doubleup deposits, previously located by his father, Joseph Yount, but work had been done on two of these by John Moss, possibly as early as 1865. It was reported to Yount that about 1880 10 tons of copper ore was n1ined and sent out to the railroad. When Yount first saw the site of Goodsprings, there was an open spring in a patch of grass east of the present hotel of the Yellow Pine Mining Co., but there was not a single tree in the flat. The spring had been named earlier for Joe Good, a cattleman, and was located by Yount as a nlill site. A. G. Campbell went to the district in 1886, and in 1887 he built the first house, a stone cabin that still stands in the center of the settlement. Campbell prospected throughout the district, and by 1892, when rich gold ore· in the Keystone n1ine attracted attention, he and his associates,
A. E: Thomas, John Kirby, and W. H. Smith, had lo-
cated the Rose, U.S. (one of the Alice group), Empire, Golden Chariot, ·May, Commercial, South Side, and Hoosier claims. During 1892 and 1893 a number of ·men went into the district, and many claims were. located, partly because of the construction of the· branch railroad from Goffs to Purdy in 1893. About 1893, according to local report, the first shipment of lead ore to a western custom smelter was made by A. G. Campbell, who assembled materia.! from several deposits, largely the Kirby, and hauled it to Purdy for shipment to El Paso.93 The silver content of the lead ore appears to haye been too low to make this profitable, and except for another shipment of 100 tons from the Potosi about 1900, little effort was .rnade to n1ine lead ore until the San Pedro, Los Angeles & Salt Lake Railroad (now Union Pacific) reached Jean in 1905.
Up to this time most of the claims had been located (1) on iron gossans that yielded assays for gold, such as the Keystone, Golden Chariot,·. Chaquita, and Clernentina, (2) on copper-stained gossans, such as the Boss, Columbia, Doubleup, Ironside, Copper Chie,, Alice, and Rose, or (3) on the iron-rich gossans of lead vel.ns, such as the May, Lucky, Tam o' Shanter, and Ruth. A few lead deposits without conspicuous gos-: sans had been located-the Potosi, Shenandoah, Lookout, Hoosier, and Root. Of all these, only a few were destip_ed to become very productive, and many rnore that were to become notable sources of ore later were not located, even if they were known.
Frorn 1893 to 1898 interest centered larg~ly iri the gold-bearing deposits,94 the Xeystone, Boss, and Clementina, although many claims were located on lea.d deposits and some work was done. A few deposits in rather inacces'sible situations, later to beconle productive sources of lead and zinc ores, were located

PRODUCTION

71

during this period--the Anchor, Sultai1, ~lfobileJ and Hilo (one of the Yellow Pine group). In 1898 an option wn.s taken on the Colun1bia and Boss mines, a mill wa.s built on the hillside south of Goodsprings, and 200 tons of copper ore wtLs shipped frmn the Boss mine to the mill. The ore was never treated in this mill, but it later served as the nucleus for the original Yellow Pine mill. At this tin1e, according to C. A. Beck, there were three buildings of stone and adobe at Goodsprings. This activity led to further prospecting, and between 1898 find 1901 tnn.ny ntare deposits were located-the Ninety-nine, Azurite, Bullion, Bill Nye, Bybee, Prairie Flower, Accident, and Red Cloud. The Bybee clain1 wns later the scene of the work that led to the ~iscov­ ery of the first zinc ore body of the Yellow Pine n1ine.
Two 1~otable events in the history of the district were the ·completion of the railroad between Los Angeles and Sn.lt Lake City in 1905, and the recognition of oxidized zinc m.inerals in Inany mines by T. C. Brown in 1906. The railroad had been built outward frorn Salt Lake City and Los Angeles, and the two parts 1net north of Jean late in 1905. The tractor road along the west side of Mesquite Valley through State Line Pass to Roach was built in 1904, largely to haul borax fr01n the Death Valley region; but it also served to pern1it easy shipn1ent of the ores from mines in the southwestern part of the district. Previously, the white and pale-brown earthy mineral, hydrozincite, coinn1only associated with the wellknown lefid Jnineqtls, was considered t·:> be a lead mineral. Brown had known the oxidized zinc n1inerals fit Magdalena,. N. ~1:ex., and readily recognized the. hydrozincite. Had 1nuch lead ore of average grade been shipped out of the district earlier, the presence of zinc would doubtless have been recognized.· As zinc 1ninerals exceeded tbose of lead in. most of the deposits, considertLble n1aterial wa.s readily minable at 1nany places, and the presence of the railroad perJnitted its ship1nent. Fron1 this tin1e onward the district rnade steady progress, and even before 1914, when war in Europe brought high prices for zinc ore, it was attracting wide attention, as is shown by the sole of son1e of the most prmnising 1nines to outside groups, notnbly the Potosi, Anchor, an4 Boss. The narrow-gage railroad froJn Jean to Goodsprings and the Yello\v Pine 1nine was built in 1910 and pennitted that n1ine to lower costs greatly. The discovery of high-grade plati..mun ore in the Boss n1ine in March, 1914, n.ttracted further tLttention in the Jnining world and led to the location of the town site of Platina, near tho old :Keystone ntill on the edge of Mesquite VaHey. The town grew quickly an~ in a few months hu.d a hotel, stores,. houses, and a population of several hundred. 'Vithin a year the boom collapsed, and in 1924 noile of the structures re.mained.
When the price of zinc reached its peak in 1915 there was feverish activity in the district, and about

1917 the population of Goodsprings reached 800. Slice then, with lower prices for the metals, it has ranged from 50 to 200. Although the town depends largely on the activities of the mines, it also has the largest supply of good water in many miles, so that it may be regarded as a permanent settlen1ent.
A review of the discovery and development of the mineral deposits of the district leaves the in1pression that the outcrops of most of them were readily recognized by the first prospectors who saw them but that their development was retarded by the high eost of transportation. When railroads drew near, many deposits were quickly exploited. Until recent years, however, most of the claims were unpatented but held by annual assessment work, which shows that most of the claims w·ere found and exploited by poor men who could not afford the costs of patenting but were content to work then1 and live near by. Compared with man·y mining districts elsewhere in N-evada and other western States, the Goodsprings district has profited little by the investments of nonresidents. Had more of these investments been Inade, many of the mines would have profited by the wider range of experience brought to bear on the local problems, among which the faulting in many mines is outstanding.
PRODUCTION os
SUMMARY
AIthough this report is concerned with the geologic features and or~ deposits of the Goodsprings quadrangle, the statistics of production are assembled for an organized mining district, the Yellow Pine d.istrict, which includes a slightly larger area and therefore several mines that lie outside the quadrangle.
The ore produced from the mines of the Yellow Pine district from 1902 to the end of 1929 amounted to 477,717 tons. Of this ore 7,656 tons was treated in amalgan1ation and cyanidation 'plants with a bullion recovery of 9,497.38 ounces of gold and 2,445 ounces of silver. The gold and silver bullion was largely recovered fr01n Keystone ore and tailings, between 1902 and 1909; also in 19i 9 and 1920. The tailings treated by cyanidation amounted to 7,843 tons, or 1nore than the ore treated in the amalgamation .mill. Between 1911 and 1929, during the operation of the concentration n1ills, 230,452 tons of ore was treated, yielding 58,641 tons of zinc-lead concentrate and 32,742 tons of lead concentrate. The crude ore shipped fron1 the district from 1-903. to 1929 amounted to 227,952 tons, containing in recovered n1etal 3,186.97 ounces of gold, 422,379 ounces of silver, 3,085,675 pounds of copper, 34,655,460 pounds of lead, and 110,833,051 pounds of zinc.
The highest average value per ton of ore produced in this district amounted to $76.22, in 1915, and the lowest average was $21.34, in 1902.

PRODUCTION BY ORES
Dry or siliceous ores.-The dry or siliceous ores mined in the Yellow Pine district came chiefly fro In the Keystone, Boss, and other properties leased to miners who shipped or· treated the ore in 1914, 1918, 1919, 1920, 1922, and 1924. This ore amounted to 1,654 tons and contained an average of $13.64 in gold and 2.93 ounces ofsilver to the ton. Small quantities of copper and lead were contained in some of the shipments. This .average does not include the ores mined prior to 1910.
Copper ore.-The copper ores included those carrying over 2.5 per cent of copper. Shipments were made most frequently from the Ninety-nine, Red Streak, Highline, Azurite, New Year, Mountain Top, Copperside,Columbia, and Boss, and less frequently from the Golden Treasure, Pilgrim, Prairie Flower, Ajax, Clementina, Alice, Doubleup, Fit?Ahugh Lee, Blue Jay, Hoosier, Mobile, Smithsonite, Tan1 o' Shanter, Lincoln, Combination, Kirby, Oro Amigo, Ironside, Lucky Strike, Yellow Pine, Hillside, Bonanza, Bill Nye, and Annex.

The average yield of 10,531 tons of copper ore shipped was $3.39 in gold and 2.86 ounces of silver to the ton and 14.26 per cent of copper.
The Rose group was the chief producer of copperlead ore, which, together with several·smalllots from another mine, amounted to 72 tons shipped to the smelter in 1916 and 191 7. This ore averaged 4 cents in gold and 11.66 ounces of silver to the ton, 5.30 per cent of copper and 25.26 per ·cent of lead. · Lead ore.-In general the crude lead ores are those containing over 4.5 per cent of lead.

The average content of the 70,748 tons of lead ore shipped was 0.10 cent. in gold and 4.67 ounces of silver to the ton, 0.04 per cent of copper, and 17.84 per cent of lead.
Ore was first calcinecl at the Potosi 1nine in 1915 by the Empire Zinc Co., which acquired the property frOJn Mahoney Bros., of San Francisco, December 10, 1913. The calciner was built in 1914 and had a capacity of 30 tons in 24 hours and was equipped to calcine the ore in an oil-fii·ed stack and rotary calcining furnace. At the Yellow Pine 1nill 4,866 tons of zinc concentrate wa.s calcined iu 1924 at a cost of $2.20 a ton, yielding 3,683 tons of calcined zinc concentrate that netted $11.86 a ton. The Yellow Pine concentrator was con1pletely destroyed by fire September 19, 1924, but was reconstructed and ready for operation in 1926. It was again destroyed by fire June 10, 1928, and a flotation mill was under construction in 1929.
Zinc-lead ore.-Most of the crude zinc-lead 'ore was separated into lead concentrate and zinc-lead concentrate. The Yellow Pine mine was the chief producer of such ore. Other mines producing concentrating ore were the Bullion, Anchor, Sultan, Tiffin, arid Fredrickson. Producers of zinc-lead ore of shipping grade were the Potosi,· which calcined 1nost of its output, and others shipping crude ore were the Ingomar, Shenandoah, 1\.filford, Addison, Hoosier, Hoodoo, New Year, l\1ounta.in Top, ChristmA.s, Bill Nye, Silver Gem, Root or Bonanza, o.nd Dawn.

from the Yellow Pine, Potosi, Monte Cristo, Milford, Addison, Bill Nye, Green Mountain, Sultan, New Year, Anchor, Prairie Flower, Ingomar, Shenandoah, and Whale mines. Shipments of zinc ore were made less frequently from the Mobile, Bullion, Valentine, .Accident, Hoodoo, Dividend, Contact, Fredrickson·, Hoosier, Alice, Christmas Consolidated (Silver Gem), Bonanza, Smithsonite, Azalia, Pilgrim, Columbia, Singer, Tam o' Shanter, Tiffin, Eureka, Valentine, Dawn, and Annex.

OUTLOOK FOR MINING IN THE DISTRICT
In a purely technical 'sense rnining is the tenn applied to the group of operations by which n1inerals are recovered from the ground; in a bron.der economic sense it includes the art of mA.king money by those operations. In other words, the interest of the public or the Nation in a resource is nwasured largely by the possibility of exploiting it at a profit in competition with other sinlliar resources, at hon1e or abroad. The purpose of these statements is to cn1phasize the economic problems of this district in contrast with the geologic problems, to which this report is largely ·devoted. It may be profitable to review briefly the history of the district in so far as this concerns production, prices, and the events that affected then1.
Fortunately, except for the early production of gold from the Keystone 1nine, there is a very complete record of the production of the mines of this district in the United States Bureau of Mines. The figures in this record have been carefully segregated and checked for con1pilation in the tables of production for each mine. Figure 13 presents curves showing the

pr.ices of zinc and lead since 1902 and the annual recoverable content of these 1netals in the ore produced in the Yellow Pine district, as well as the curve of wholesale conunodity prices. Frmn what has boon said 01i. page 71 concerning the discovery of the oro deposits, as well us the accounts of the individual mines, it see1ns that the value of the zinc, lead, and copper ores was too low to permit their shiprnent before the Los Angelos & Salt Lake Railroad was c01nplet~ed to J'eun. The low value of the ores was due to the 1neager an1ounts of accessory gold and silver that they contained. It is doubtful whether any shipments prior to 1905, except those of gold bullion, yielded a profit to the miners. Even after the railroad was in operation through Jean, the cost of the 8 to 25 mile wagon haul fron1 the mines probably wiped out for several years the margin of profit for 1nost · mines on all except occasional carefully selected shipments. The great increase in production in 1912 was due to the c01npletion in 1911 of the Yellow Pine Mining Co.'s narrow-gage railroad frmn tTean to the mine, a distance of 12 miles. The further increase during 1913 and 1914 ropreserits largely the 1nining of reserves in the Yellow Pine 1nine, developed in anticipation of the c01npletion of its railroad. The decline in zinc production during the business depression of 1907 and H}QS indicates the sensitiveness of mine operations to slight declines in prices.
Figure 13 brings out clearly the astonishing increase .in production brought about by high prices for zinc .during the early years of the World War-1915, HH6, .and 1917. How much would have been produced by -the district under normal prices is a matter for in-teresting conjecture. A considerable part of the in·Crease in production of the Yellow Pine mine during these years is due to the fortunate discovery of .enornwus bodies of ore between the 300 and 700 foot levels north of the Ifale shaft. One effect of high pricos for the 1netals dudng the war was shown quickly by decline in grade of the ore shipped from many nunes. Prior to 1914 nlost shiplnents of zinc ·Ore. contained frmn 38 to 42 per cent of zinc, but .during the period of high prices much 30 per cent ore and so1ne 25 per cent ore was shipped. One factor th!l.t increased the gross output of both lead and zinc fron1 1912 onward, but especially during the war, was the better prices offered for the 1nixed lead and zinc ·Ores, which could be used to 1nake pign1ent (leaded zinc oxide) but could not be treated pro:fitabiy to make two products, one containing lead and the other zinc.
It is difficult to apportion the causes of the trend .of production since 1918. Obviously the low production for 1921 and 1922 indicates that the mines could not produce ore at the prices prevailing, but on the other hand, the policy of the board of .directors of one mine

was a factor, for there were known ore bodies in that mine which could have been mined at a profit, but they were held for better prices. Another element, the general rise of commodity prices, enters into the general failure of a developed district to continue to produce after 1919 in accordance with the hope held out by its earJier record. Although indicated by the curves of wholesale prices· and the prices c;>f the metals i11 Figure 13, it is also widely know~ that the prices of zinc and lead are relatively lower than the wholesale · · con1modity price since the war.96 In other words, the products offered for sale by the mine operators have declined in real value, whereas the real prices of the materials which they n1ust use in mining have risen.
The records of dividends is available for only three mining companies, the Yellow Pine Mining Co., the Goodsprings Anchor Mining Co., and the Boss Gold Mining Co., and these give an inadequate picture of the profit of mining in the district. A few of the n1ines are owned by incorporated comp'anies, and some of these have not worked the mines on company account. The shipments fron1 most of the mines, especially the smaller ones, have been made by groups of lessees, and the pro:fit realized from their .work is unknown. Doubtless in the aggregate their profit has been considerable, but it is also apparent that numerous lessees have done an extraordinary amount of hard work for little or no return.
The foregoing review indicates the wide range of factors that affect the production of minerals and that must be considered in estimating what may be produced from a given district, the quantity and grade of the ore as wel1 as other local resources, mining skill, geologic understanding, luck, metallurgical advances, transportation facilities, trend of prices of the materials produced and of the 1naterials purchased, and trend of economic and political events of national .and international scope.
Of the reserves of minerals in the district very 1ittle that is precise or quantitative can be stated, as the time available for this examination did not permit careful studies. The visible zinc, lead, copper, and gold minerals are apparent]y exhausted from a few mines, but these are a small part of the total, for n1ost of the mines still show sporadic patches of high-grade material and much more of a lower grade. Only here and there, however, are· the assured reserv'es of lowgrade ore in excess of a few thousand tons, though further exp]oration will doubtless increase these reserves.
With only a few exceptions, the ore bodies that have been exploited in the district are those that have been fortuitously exposed at the surface by erosion. As in
oo Hanley, H. E., Diminishing value of the metals: Eng. and Min. Jour., vol. 120, pp, 622-623, 1925.

76 GEOLOGY AND ORE DEPOSITS OF GOODSPRINGS QUADRANGLE, NEVADA

many if not most other districts in the Western States, there has been little systematic prospecting in this district (from 5,000 to 10,000 feet of work) for ore bodies other than those which cropped out. Of course, an examination of the records of production of many of the mines will show that the probable margin of profit on work to date has not been large and that in most places prospecting remote from known ore should be undertaken cautiously. Nevertheless, parts of the district; especially those in which the structural relations of the ore bodies are fairly clear, warrant careful study with a view to making comprehensive plans for underground exploration. Such studies of the smaller mines should take into account the relation of past production to current metal prices, for when the curves for both are compared it is clear that most of these mines can be operated at a profit only when the prices of lead and zinc exceed 6 cents a pound.
The prob]em of· understanding and applying the relations of ore zones to channels of access of ore minerals and also that of discriminating between premineral and postmineral fractures need considerable attention, and upon their correct solution from place to place In the district rests the greatest hope of future production. Although the writer hopes that his studies have contributed to this end, he is quite aware that the problems encountered in a number of mines have not been considered comprehensively.
ORE DEPOSITS

above extensive thrust faults, notably the Contact and Keystone faults. Most of the zinc and lead deposits lie in 'the rocks overlying the zone of intrusions. A few, such as the Potosi and others near the Ninetynine mine, are as much as 6 miles distant from the nearest known outcropping bodies of intrusive rocks. No porphyry intrusions are known in the Spring Mountains for 40 miles north and 10 miles south of the quadrangle. There is thus a general but not precise areal coincidence of the zone of intrusives and the area which contains most of the ore deposits. For this reason it is believed that there is a genetic relation between the ore deposits and the porphyry intrusives. (See fig. 14.)
GROUPS OF ORE DEPOSITS ACCORDING TO METAL CONTENT
On the basis of their principa] metal content, the ore deposits ·of the region ·are separable into four groups-(1) those which contain gold with little if any copper and silver, (2) those which contain much more silver than gold, (3) those whose principal metal is copper but which also contain some gold or platinum and palladium, though little silver, and (4) those which contain either lead or zinc or both together with a little copper. Cobalt occurs almost uniformly wherever copper is present and has been n1ined in four localities. Vanadium minerals occur in many of the lead and zinc deposits and have been mined in several places.
MINERALOGY

DISTRIBUTION

CLASSIFICATION OF THE MINERALS

The Goodsprings quadrangle contains most of the known ore deposits in the Spring Mountains. Most of· these deposits occur in an area about 10 miles in diameter, the center of which lies about 4 miles southwest of Goodspring~ (pl. 30), but a few are sporadically distributed in the north half of the quadrangle. A few productive mines lie several miles west of the quadrangle (Gre.en Monster and Rainbow) and a few more south of it (Tam o' Shanter and Carbonate King). A few prospects lie in the part of the Bird Spring R~nge east of the quadrangle.
SUMMARY OF GEOLOGIC RELATIONS OF THE ORE DEPOSITS
The ore deposits of this ·region are found either in the Paleozoic stratified rocks or in the porphyritic rocks intrusive into them. Most of the deposits, including the most productive, occur in dolornitized zones of lower Mississippian limestone. A few deposits, in which gold and silver are the metals sought, occur in dikes of highly altered intrusive porphyry. These intrusions are localized eithe:f in or a short distance

In considering each of these groups of deposits the· content and relations of the original minerals, unaffected by recent weathering (hypogene) should be distinguished clearly from those which have formed during .weathering. (supergene).97 Not only are the minerals of the two stages largely unlike, but their relations to fractures, faults, and near-by rocks· are different. In some deposits the unchanged original minerals have been mined and theii· relations are fairly clear, but in most of the deposits, under the influence of weathering, the metals have not only migrated from their original positions but entirely new mineral compounds have been formed. Such migrations have been accompanied by solution and decomposition of the near-by rocks with the result that the present relations of the deposits to faults and other features are very obscure. Some bodies of galena, such as the Anchor, Accident,\ and Ruth, are largely unaltered; but others, such as
v7 Ransome bas applied the term supergene to minerals deposited by generally downward-moving and initially cold solutions. Hypogene is applied to minerals deposited by bot ascending solutions.

the Kirby, have been largely converted to lead carbonate and sulphate, which lie in different positions a~d have different relations to the near-by rocks. On the other hand, although sphalerite or zinc sulphide was the original zinc mineral in all deposits, it was found unaltered in two n1ines only, the Potosi and Milford. The bodies of zinc ore that l~ave been mined are almost entirely alteration products-hydrozincite, smithsonite, and calamine-and these lie either near by or many feet from the masses of sulphide that were

the source of the zinc. Sin1ilarly, the original copper . mineral in most qf the deposits was doubtless the sulphide, chalcopyrite, but this has been found only in traces in the mined deposits. The principal copper ·minerals-malachite, azurite, and chrysocolla-are clearly many feet distant from the original sulphidechalcopyrite-although sporadic masses of chalcocite may lie near the· places where it once existed.
The following table summarizes the minerals associated with the four groups of ore deposits.

The foregoing table has been prepared to show the

distribution and relative abundance of most of the

minerals in the ore deposits of the district. Below are

presented the properties and relations of the minerals,

con1piled in accordance with Dana's "Systmn of

mineralogy.''

.

CHARACTER AND RELATIONS OF THE MINERALS
NATIVE METALS
Gold.-Although native gold (Au) was found by the writer in only one place in the district, on the 300-foot level north from the Keystone shaft, it is clear from the records of production, as well as local report, that gold is rather widespread in the region of the Keystone, Red Cloud, Lavina, and Boss mines and several prospects near Crystal Pass. In the Keystone mine the

gold ranged in fineness from 0.920 to 0.930, and it was largely. associated with dense lin1onite, dark chert, or greenish clay. In the Clementina, Chaquita, and other near-by prospects it seems to have been closely associated with limonite, doubtless derived from pyrite. According to Knopf,98 the gold in the plumbojarosite ore of the Boss mine was blackish and spongy and the normal color developed only after treatment with acid and annealing. After this treatment the fine~ess was 0.928. The black color and sponginess of the gold indicate that before the deposit was tho~­ oughly oxidized the gold was not free but con1bined with some other element, now removed by oxidation. According to Joe Armstrong, operator and part owner

of the Ued Cloud mine, free gold was never seen in ore from that mine, either unoxidized or oxidized, but it could be dissolved out in solutions of potassiu1n cyanide. It seems possible that here, also, in the unoxidized ore the gold was c01nbined. with son1e other elmnent.
OoJJper.-Native copper (Cu) was not observed by the writer in any of the ores, but according to F. R. Crmnpton, s1nall qun,ntities were sparsely distributed through ore frqn1 one of the shoots in the Boss n1ine.
Platinum.-In addition to the occurrence of platinum (Pt) in the Boss n1ine described below, authentic assays of 1naterial fr01n the Oro An1igo mine leave no doubt that small quantities of platinun1 are present there. H. l::Xardy, who shipped copper ore from the Golden Chariot 1nine, states that assays of the ore have shown as 1nuch as half an ounce of platinum to the ton, but this was not confinned by the writer. A sam.ple of pure jarosite from the Copperside mine, sub1nitted to R. Perez, of Los Angeles, for assay, was reported to contain no platinmn. When the difficulties inherent in the accurate determination of platinum are considered, it see1ns doubtful whether the presence of the 1netal has been detern1ined confidently at more than three localities in the district.
According to K.nopf,00 both the platinum and the palladiu:m of the Boss deposit occur in extremely small particles of dark color, and the metallic gray luster is revealed only by fusion with sodilun c.arbonate. He ·considered the possibility that the platinum might have been derived from sperrylite, but could find no trace of that 1nineral by panning.
SULPHIDES
Stibnite.-At several places on the north 900-foot level of theYellow Pine mine, where the porphyry dike abuts against the ore-bearing limestone,. there are sporadic .nodules of chert that range frmn 2 to 6 inches in dia1neter and contain large bladed crystals of stibnite (Sb2S3) that radiate fron1 the centers. In some of these nodules the sulphide of antimony has weathered to the oxide, probably stibiconite.
Galena.-Galena (PbS) is one of the three or four most abundcmt ore minerals in the district, for it is the sulphide that :most effectively resists oxidation. Con1:.. monly it is en1bedded in solid dolomite and shows only a faint suggestion of definite crystal outline. Even where, as in the Sultan 1nine, it occurs in a breccia containing considerable pore space, it rarely develops as well-tenninated crystals. In 1nost places, however, the cubic cleavage is well developed, and broken fragments are bounded by sn1ooth cleavage surfaces. Only here and there, as at the New Year mine, do fragments show a feathery appearance, and material with the finely crystalline texture of steel is practically unlmown.
~o Kuopr, Adolph, op. cit., p. 9.

A little silver accon1panies the galena, but, in contrast with the product of many western rnining districts, the ratio of silver to lead is low. Although only a few assays of pure galena are available, the assays of n1any shipments that contained from 65 t.o 75 per cent of lead (80 to 90 per cent of galena if all were present as the sulphide) indicate that the range is 1 ounce of · silvet· to every 2 to 10 per cent of lead. (See p. 90.) The nearly constant presence of green or bluish stains or thin films in the oxidized lead minerals that surround nuclei of galena indicates that it contains a little copper also.
Ohalcocite.-According to J. C. Jenson, the deeper workings of the Ninety-nine mine yielded several tons of ore in which chalcocite (Cu2S) was abundant, but elsewhere in the district only a "little of this mineral has been found. The material from the Ninety-nine mine formed large irregular masses of characteristic gray color and fine texture and was free from appreciable quantities of other minerals. Compared with that from rnany other western districts the silver content was very lo;w, scarcely 1 ounce to the 100 pounds of copper.
Sphalerite.- Although there is no doubt that the oxidized zinc minerals of the district are derived from sphalerite (ZnS), the working~ of only a few mines have penetrated deep enough to expose it. At the Potosi, where sphalerite is abundant in the inner, deeper workings, it forms irregular masses embedded in dolomite. None has been seen covering the walls of drusy c~ities. These masses are made up oi interlocking grains, .each of which shows the characteristic brilliant cleavage faces. The color is uniformly dark brown, and it is estimated that the iron content is 2 or 3 per cent. Material found on the third level of the Milford mine has the same propet·ties. On the other hand, a specimen reported. to have come from the Root mine shows terminated crystals of light rosin-colored sphalerite embedded in fine sandstone. Without doubt, most of the material that originally made up the deposits of the district resembles that at the Potosi and Milford mines.
Cinnabar.- The border zones of oxidized lead minerals that surround nuclei of galena from several mines sporadically show brilliant red coatings which are locally called "red lead." Such 1naterial from the first level of the Kirby mine, the bottom of the Fredrickson shaft, and the 200 and 900 foot levels north of the Yellow Pine mine proved by chemical tests to be cinnabar (HgS). Doubtless the galena from these mines contains a little mercury, which is set free by oxidation and, after migrating a short distance, is redeposited as the sulphide. The exact cause of the precipitation is obscure, for the cinnabar is tmiformly deposited on the carbonate or sulphate of lead or oxide of antimony, as much as an inch from the nearest

silica encountered in carbonate sediinents and rarely to fol'lns of silica in ore deposits, the propriety of using it here may be questioned. If the properties o'f the 1naterial here tenned "chert" are reviewed, it will be seen that the other na1nes widely applied to the silica Ininorals-quartz, chalcedony, opal, tridymite, and cristobalite-are not appropriate. The definition of chert given above is not as precise as those of the other names applied to the for1ns of silica, and for this reason if for no other, it should have a place in the litei'ature.5
Like quartz, a little chert is rather widespread in the district, but several n1ines contain large quantitiesnotably the Kitby, Tam o' Shanter, and Oro Amigo. Two varieties 1nay be distinguished, one which is light, com1nonly crean1-colored (pl. 24, A, B), and another which ranges in color fr01n light to dark brown· and yellowish brown, the color being due to intimately mixed ii·on hydrate.
Cream-colored chert forn1s veinlike masses 6 to 24 inches wide in the Kirby, John, Tam o' Shanter, and Oro Amigo mines. In masses as well as thin chips it is opaque or only feebly translucent. It breaks with a conchoidal fracture. By the immersion method the range of index of refraction is 1.54 ± 0.005. ·Each of several specin1ens tested in a closed tube yielded a little water; a sample fr01n the Kirby mine contained 0.78 per cent of water. Viewed in thin sections with polarized light, this chert appears to be isotropic. and shows nu1nerous n1inute inclusions and sporadic angular grains of clear quartz (pl. 25); but when examined with the oil in1n1ersion lens and high illumination the apparently isotropic chert is seen to be wholly granular, though the grains are extremely min11te, probably Inost of thmn less than 0.002 nllllimeter in diameter. The quartz grains show no trace of attack by solution and probably have been preserved from the material that the chert replaced, either shale or dolomite.
Such cherts from several mines also contain crystals of jarosite. · In so1ne .places· myriads of perfect flat rhmnbic crystals of nearly uniform size (0.01 to 0.03 n1illi1neter) are closely packed in a finely crystalline
groundn1ass of chert. (See pl. 25, A, B.) Elsewhere,
as at the prospect in the center of sec. 25, T. 24 S., R. 57 E., gradations 1nay be found in thin sections from clear, colorless, nearly isotropic chert to that which is datk yellow. Such dark areas are not homogeneous but have a Ininutely granular appearance, although no crystals of jarosite larger than 0.005 1nilli1neter can be recognized. (See pl. 26, A, B.) Here and there in tho 1nidst of the yellow chert there are clear, colorless

areas of crystalline quartz in the center of which there are crystals or aggregates of crystals of jarosite 0.001 to 0.05 millimeter in diameter. (See pl. 27, A.) It appears that the yellow chert is an intimate nlixture of minutely granular chalcedony and uncrystallized jarosite and that the clear quartz and jarosite crystals represent the segregated and recrystallized minute grains of these minerals.6
Although the cream-colored chert and mixtures with jarosite are found at or near the surface, they are more abundant at depths of 100 to 200 feet, as at the Kirby mine. In many places there is evidence that the chert is soluble and replaceable near the surface by cherty iron hydrate, which makes up the second variety.
Ferruginous cherts are ·abundant at the Tam o' · Shanter, Ironside, Kirby, John, Oro Amigo, Prairie Flower, and Yellow Pine mines. Most of the material is· brown and. homogeneous; some is mottled light yellowish brown and dark brown. It yields tt yellowish.. brown streak and generally is harder than steel. All of it yields considerable water in a closed tube. Thin sections of such material are light brown but granular and translucent. They show no free silica, either quartz, chert, or chalcedony, and .although largely isotropic show faint traces of birefringence. The exact iron content has not been determined in any specimen, but simple tests indicate that it ranges from 10 to 30 per cent. Commonly the ferruginous cherts are closely associated with earthy limonite, and both are most abundant in a zone that lies above the cream-colored chert.
That both varieties of chert disappear at depths of 100 to 250 feet below the surface is considered adequate proof that they have been for1ned by circulation of surface water.
Ohalcedony.---The · comn10n mammillary forms of clear an~ translucent chal~edony are found sporadically in the district and appear to be one of the minerals formed by recent supergene processes.
Opal.-In some of the copper deposits, notably the Boss, thin.films of clear opal (Si02.nH20) were noted.
Stibiconite.-At a prospect near the center of the southern border of sec. 21, T. 24 S., R. 58 E., 1,500 feet south of the Ruth mine, a quartz vein contains a pale-yellow amorphous material that has been determined by W. T. Schaller to be a hydrous antin10ny oxide, probably stibiconite (2Sb02.H20). Doubtless the unweathered antin10ny mineral was stibnite. The quantity of such material is small.
The stibnite crystals from chert nodules on the 900foot level north in the Yellow Pine mine are partly altered to a white powder that is probably stibiconite.
Ouprite.-Cuprite (Cu20) was observed at only a few mines but was probably common in the oxidized ore from most of the copper mines. At the Rose

84 GEOLOGY AND ORE DEPOSITS OF GOODSPRINGS QUADRANGLE, NEVADA

mine grains of cuprite form nuclei in veinlets of copper pitch that cut the dolomite wall rock.
Tenorite.-Earthy black grains intimately mixed with limonite from the Yellow Pine mine were shown by test to be wholly copper oxide and undoubtedly are tenorite (CuO). In many of the copper deposits, notably the Columbia, plumose masses of malachite contain abundant black grains that are probably tenorite.
1
I-Iematite and magnetite.-About half a mile southeast of Crystal Pass there are two prospec.ts that explore lenses of siderite in which are embedded grains and masses of hen1atite (Fe20 3) and magnetite (Fe30 4). One of these lenses lies between two sills of orthoclase porph:fry. Neither of these minerals was observed elsewhere in the district.
Limonite.-Limonite (2Fe20 3.3H20) is eommon thrvughout the district but is most abundant in the deposits exploited for copper. Soft yellowish-brown ocher is abundant ~t the Ironside and Tam o' Shanter mines, and every transition may be found to dense hard brown cherts that contain from 10 to 20 per f'ent of iron. Some of the earthy limonite has clearly been formed by the decomposition of jarosite or related sulphates, and much of the earthy variety may be formed in this way. Close search at the Ironside mine failed to reveal any jarosite, however. At the Valentine mine there were stalactites of limonite as much as 0.75 inch in diameter embedded in hydrozincite.
Turgite.-The jarositic cherts that are so abundant in and characteristic of the Kirby mine are weathered to yellow-brown in the upper part of it and near the surfaee to a dark-brown chert 'that yields a red streak. Tests show that the water content of the dark-brown ehert is much lower than that of the yellow-brown chert, and the conclusion is reached that the pigment of the first is turgite (2Fe203.H20).
In the same part of the ·mine the ore body contains lenses as much as several inches thick of very fine darkbrown powder, which, when disturbed, runs freely in the stopes. Under the n1icroscope the grains are seen to be nearly spherical and surprisingly ·Uniform in size, 0.005 to 0.04 Inillimeter in diameter. They are a hydrous oxide of iron, and, as their streak is red, the conclusion is reached that they are turgite. As the lenses have the same associatioPs as yellow plumbojarosite in thelower le\Tels and the range in size of the grains is nearly the same, it seems clear that the turgite has been derived from plumboj arosite.
Wad.-Manganese oxides are rather _uncommon in the district, and as none of the crystalline varieties have been noted, all are considered to be wad (Mn203. nH20): The largest quantity was found in a prospect east of the Ninety-nine mine, where nodules of earthy oxide are enveloped in crusts of euprodescloizite.
Heterogenite. -The uncommon mineral heterogenite (Co0:2Co20 3.6H20), the hydrous oxide of cobalt, wa.s

first recognized in the district in 1921, and after a systematic search it was found rather widely. During this investigation care was taken to note the presence of black minerals, and many speein1ens were tested with the blowpipe, with the result that heterogenite is now known to exist in most of the copper deposits. The purest material consists of the black n1ammillary crusts or stalactites found on the Blue Jay, Copper Chief, and Colun1bia claims, but these are not abundant. A much more common material is brownish dolomite that shmvs black spots or dendritic growths of .hydrous cobalt oxide. Here the oxide replaces the dolomite, and locally the replacement of masses 2 or 3 inches in diameter is nearly complete. Such material was noted in the Columbia, Boss, Blue Jay; Highline, Copperside, Redstreak, Mountain King, Co'pper Glance, and Contact mines. (See pl. 27, B.)
The ultimate source of the cobalt in the heterogenite is probably some sulphide or arsenide, although most ·of it· appears to have passed through the stage of cobalt carbonate (p. 85).
CARBONATES
Galcite.-Calcite (CaC03) is not an abundant mineral in the ore deposits, in spite of the fact that the rocks in which they are found were once largely calcium carbonate. It is common in some of the zinc-lead deposits, especially those in which lead greatly exceeds zinc.. In these, pure-white calcite forms coarsely crystalline aggregates that fill drusy eavities and hence is the latest mineritl deposited by the metallizing solutions. (See pl. 28, B.) Specimens collected below the limit of weathering at the Potosi n1ine show white calcite filling the cavities, which are lined with terminated erystals of dolomite and sphalerite. In a few mines, notably the Monte Cristo, the walls of open cavities near the surface are eovered with thick crusts of pale-yellowish dear calcite, but it is believed that this has been deposited recently by surface waters.
As noted elsewhere (p. 63), dear ealcite fills minute cavities lined with dolomite crystals thmughout the areas of dolomitized. limestone. Here and there, notably half a mile northwest of the Blue Jay mine, fault breceias in limestones are filled with white calcite.
Aragonite.-Aragonite (CaC03) was recognized with confidence at only three mines-the Prairie Flower, Mobile, and Shenandoah-where cavities that doubtless represent recent watercourses are lined with a layer of white calcium carbonate that is loeally covered with crystals of aragonite.
Siderite.-Siderite (FeC03) was recognized with . assurance at only one place in the district, a prospect
in the NE. X SW. X sec. 1, T. 25 S., R. 58 E., where,
together with hematite, magnetite, and silica, it re.places dolomite of the Goodsprings formation.

normal crea1n-colored dolmnite is altered to light brown. (Seep. 56.) This change in color corresponds with an increase in the iron content, which is doubtless present as a carbonate. The same conditions wet'e
noted near the basalt dike in the SvV. X sec. 30, T. 24 S., H. 58 E. (See p. 56.)
Dolomites.-Although dol01nitized limestone is the country rock of n1ost of the ore deposits of the region (sec pp. 57-67), dolomite ((Ca,Mg)C03) is uncomn1on among the minerals deposited later than the ores. In the Potosi and many other mines crystals of gray or white dolomite covered the walls of cavities in the ore bodies before white calcite was deposited. At the Blue Jay deposit, which lies in the Bullion dolomite, the stalactitic masses of hcterogenite are enveloped in white, fmely crystalline dolomite, thus showing that it was locally deposited since the mineral deposits wen} oxidized. At one place in the north end of this mine, arborescent masses of small crystals of dolomite fill a watercourse and may have been deposited since weathering began.
Cobalt-bearing dolornite.-In several places in the district, notably the Blue Jay and Contact claims, coarsely ceystalline pale-pink dolomite is found. 'The colot· is due to the presence of small quantities of cobalt carbonate. In rough masses the color seems to be unifonn, but on polished surfaces· it is distinctly sporadic. The color is due to the presence of thin films of pink cobalt carbonate on the cleavage surfaces of the dolomite. Although cobalt carbonate causes the colot·, the percentage is low, as an analysis of the deeply pink material from the Contact claim by J. G. Fairchild in the laboratory of the Geological Suevey showed only 0.43 per cent of cobalt oxide. The smne material also contained 0.21 per cent of nickel oxide. Doubtless both oxides are combined with carbonic oxide. Similar cobalt-bearing calcite has been noted by the writer in material from the Tantara mine, Katanga, Belgian Congo.
Oerusite.-Despite the fact that cerusite (PbC03) is very widesprea.d, well-crystallized speci1nens are rather unconunou. Good specimens of the typical penetration-twin crystals were found in the Yellow Pine mine as deep as the lowest levels and sporadically elsewhere. Comn1only the cerusite is either granular, as in the lenses in the chert at the Kirby mine, or dense and porcclainlike but colored dmk gray or brown. In several localities, notably certain prospects on the Rose group of claims, a peculiar variety of hard carbonate ore was found. Polished and thin sections of this ore show rounded grains of cerusite on1bed.ded in a n1atrix of clear chert.
Smithsonite.-S1nall quantities of smithsonite (ZnC03) occur widely throughout the district, but in only a few 1nines, notably the Yellow Pine and Monte Cristo, has it been sufficiently abundant to constitute a. valuable ore. . Commonly it forms gray botryoidal

or stalactitic masses that have grown in open spaces,

generally watercourses. A gray earthy but dense

variety of anhydrous carbonate of zinc, outwardly

altered to white hyd1ozincite, was found on the south

600-foot level of the Yellow Pine mine. A somewhat

similar gray carbonate fron1 the upper part of the 700-

foot stope of the Yellow Pine mine contains· consider-

able water and is therefore hydrozincite. The rhombic

crystals found in n1any zinc deposits are conspicuously

absent here.

Malachite.-Malachite (CuC03.Cu(OHh) is the most abundant copper ·n1ineral in the district. At the

Ninety-nine and Columbia n1ines it forn1ed crusts and

nodular Inasses n1ade up of the typical radiating

crystals. A large pa.rt of the copper in the Boss ore was

present as loosely coherent masses of s.mall crystals.

A nun1ber of smaJl n1ines have shipped heavily stained

dolon1ite in which thin films. of malachite lie either

along cleavage planes or in veinlets. In several

places, notably the Blue Jay mine, very perfect crys-

tals of malachite pseudon1orphous after azurite were

found.

Azurite.-Azurite (2CuC03.Cu(OH)2) ·is rather uncomnlon in the district but may have been more

abundant in son1e of the ores shipped. It forn1s dense

earthy masses in the n1idst of other eopper or iron

minerals.

·

Aurichalcite.-Plumose aggregates of delicate pale-

blue or sky-blue crystals of aurichalcite (2 (Zn,Cu).C03•
3(Zn, Cu)(OH)2) are present here and there through-
out the district. In it few places, such as the upper

large stopes of the Yellow Pine mine, it was the

principal mineral in beautiful pale-blue masses that

weighed from 1 to 5 pounds.· Not uncomm6nly it is

the only copper-bearing mineral recognizable in son1e

of the zinc deposits.

Hydrozi.ncite.-The most abundant zinc mineral in

the ore bodies so far explored in the district is hydro-

zineite (ZnC03.2Zn(OH)2). · Masses of the 1nineral are uniformly earthy in texture, and the eolor ranges

from pure white to dark brown. (See pl. 29.) Some

speei1nens from the Pilgrin1 and a few other mines are

pale lilac; this eolor is destroyed by heating, but its

cause is unknown. Thin sections show a minutely

granular texture or a felted mass of minute needles

that range fron1 0.01 to 0.05 n1illimeter in length.

Dioptase.-In a few places, notably the Mountain

dioptase (H2CuSi04) are scattered over crusts of chrysocolla in druses. ·

Ohrysocolla.-In a few mines and prospec.ts, such as

the Lincoln and Platina, chrysocolla (CuSi02.2H20)

is the most abundant mineral; it is widespread else-

where but rarely abundant. Locally it replaces

dolomite; generally it forms botryoidal masses in

cavities. Here and there, as at the Boss mine, it is

covered by a thin layer of opal. No attempt has been

made to discriminate the similar mineral bisbeeite.

Vanadates of either lead, zinc, or copper are uncom- · monly widespread in the district, but only a few specific determinations of the minerals were made. During the progress of field work many specimens suspected of containing vanadates were tested with hydrochloric acid, and the presence of a vanadate was proved. According to this test, if the vanadate~ of lead, zinc, and copp·er are wet with hydrochloric acid, they turn first yellowish, then reddish brown. Specific determinations can be made only on well-crystallized material or by comprehensive chemical analyses. Concentration tests on the crude ores from the Hoodoo, Fredrickson, and Spelter mines, show the presence of vanadates, which are otherwise difficult to recognize.
Vanadinite.-Vanadinite ((PbCl)Pb4(V04)3) may be rather· widespread but was distinguished only at one locality, in several prospects east of the Silver Gem tunnels in Devil Canyon. It forms brownish, waxy crusts and hexagonal prisms on open cracks not far

A number of prospects on the Whale group· yield large specimens that show crusts of the mineral covered with perfect nearly black crystals. Prospects on the Bill Nye and Ninety-nine groups yield good specimens of mammillary green cuprodescloizite. Tests indicate that the brown vanadate of the Spelter and Hoodoo claims contains appreciable copper and is probably this mineral.

SULPHATES

A.nglesite.-Inas1nuch as anglesite (PbS04) appears to be tho first stage of weathering of galena, it is doubtless a.s widespread in the district as that 1nineral. It is not abundant, however, and only rarely crystallized. A resident of the district possesses a very perfect pseudornorph of cerusite after anglesite, 1 inch in dimneter, said to have b~ten found in the Prairie Flower mine. Conunonly it is n1assive and vitreous with a greasy luster, and the color is dark gray.
13rochantite.-Brochantite (CuS04.3Cu(OH)2) was reported by Knopf 8 from the Boss m.ine.
Barite.-Barite (BaS04) has been observed at but three localities in the district. Near the southeast corner of sec. 8, T'. 24 S., R. 58 E., a prospect pit 15 feet deep ha.s been sunk on a vein of nearly pure barite, 12 to 18 inches wide, which lies parallel with the bedding of tho inclosing limestone. The color is gray, and the structure is plun1ose. A little calcite is dissrminnted through it, and it appears to have replaced tho limestone. In the south drift of the Argentenr~ mine veins of coarsely crystalline white barite replace the Yellowpine li1nestone. The mineral is also present in a vein largely Inade up of pyrite near the Keystone dun1p.
Linarite.-Uncon1monly large and perfect crystals of linarite ((Pb,Cu)S04.(Pb,Cu)(OH)2 'were found in one place on the north 900-foot level of the Yellow Pine mine. The largest crystal was tabular prisn1atic and about 4 inches long. The mineral is uncommon, but sporadic patches were noted at the Root mine and elsewhere. Tho crystals are almost uniformly covered with a layer of caledonite, a similar basic sulphate of copper, which represents a surficial alteration. Tliis change involves a loss of the sulphuric anhydride and a larger loss of the copper present in the Iinarite. ·
S1nall quantities of linarite have been observed in a nun1ber of lead-1nining districts of the Western States. Corrunonly a little caledonite is associated with the linarite.9
Gypsum.-Perfect crystals of gypsmu (CaS04.2H20) an inch or n1ore long are abundant on the surface of Mesquite Dry Lake. The Inineral was noted in only a few mines n.nd is very uncomn1on. Beds of gypsmn occur in the red shaly sandstone at the top of the Supai formation and between the t\VO limestone Inenlbers of the Kaibab lirnestone.

Jarosite group.-Nlinerals of the jarosite group are ·comn1on in the district and show a wide range of associations. Their presence is readily determined by simple chemical tests or examination under the microscope. On the other hand, the confident discriinination between the several species requires either exhaustive microscopic tests or chemical analyses, and only a few of these have been made. The minerals seem to be uncommonly stable, both on the surface and throughout the present limit of mine explorations; near the Lavina n1ine natrojarosite is common on the surface. Here and there, as in the Kirby, John, and Tan1 o' Shanter n1ines, the local relations indicate that jarosite has decomposed near the surface to form turgite and limonite.
Except plumbojarosite, which locally is compact and massive, ·all the tninerals of the jarosite group ·com1nonly form aggregates of very perfect crystals whose range in size is frmn 0.01 to 0.10 millimeter, although some are as large as 1.0 millimeter. Not uncommonly a· specimen that weighs a pound or more and appears earthy to the unaided eye is made up entirely of perfect cr.vstals that range from 0.01 to 0.05 millimeter in diameter.
Alunite (K20.3Al203.4S03.6H20) is common in the Kirby mine but was not found elsewhere. Lenses of pure-white earthy tnaterial in the chert of that mine proved to b~ n1ade up entirely of minute perfect rhmnbohedrons of alunite. In the zone 100 to 200 feet below the surface, the shale near the top of the Goodsprings dolomite· is sporadically replaced by chalky alunite. ·
N atrojarosite (Na20.3Fe20a.4S04.6H20) is probably the con1monest variety in the district, although isomorphous nlixtures with jarosite and other members of the group have been shown to be present. It is the most abundant sulphate in the Boss mine, where it forms yellow earthy lenses and masses of irregular shape. It is abundant in the Copperside mine, both as earthy masses and as minute crystals suspended in a matrix of calcite.
Jarosite (K20.3Fe203.4S03.6H20) is abundant at the Kirby and John mines, wl\ere it shows stages of altera- ' tion to plmnbojarosite. (See pls. 24-26.) In order to throw light on this problen1 specimens of three varieties were submitted toW. T. Schaller, of the United States Geological Survey, for optical exatninution and chemical analysis. His report is summarized below. The optical determinations were made by E. S. Larsen. All the specimens were collected frmn the 100-foot level south in the Kirby mine, and it is clear from the local relations that the yellow material, A, is produced by the alteration of the brown material, C.
Specimen Cis brown in color, well crystallized, and, to judge from the optical examination, is probably homogeneous. Its index is slightly higher than that of jarosite (1.82) but not as high as that of plumbojarosite (1.87); it is estimated to. be about

88 GEOLOGY AND ORE DEPOSITS OF GOODSPRINGS QUADRANGLE, NEVADA

1.83-1.84. This material is probably a fairly uniform isomorphous mixture of jarosite and plumbojarosite, nearer to jarosite. This suggestion is verified by chemical determinations, as shown below. The analyses are only approximate.

No phosphate is present. It is significant that, in contrast to specimen ,A, this material seems to be optically homogeneous.
No quantitative determinations were made on specimen B, as the material is too scanty and not well individualized. It seems to be the same as specimen C, as it contains much potash.
Specimen A is a yellowish powder and, as determined by the optical examination, a mixture. There is so;me jarosite (1.82) some plumbojarosite (much greater than 1.82 and higher than sample C), and probabiy 'a good deal of some intermediate i&omorphous member of the group. Many of the crystals are zoned, the composition of the central part being near jarosite and that of the border close.to plumbojarosite. The material is apparently jarosite changing to plumbojarosite. The sample contains a small quantity of some other lead mineral.

This analysis can be interpreted as showing a mixture, mechanically as well as isomorphously, of 54 per cent of jarosite, 38 per cent of plumbojarosite, and 7 per cent of a theoretical iron-plumbogummite (2Pb0.3Fe203.2P20 5. 7H20). A slight excess of lead is left unaccounted for by such an interpretation. The analysis also can be interpreted, by referring the P20s present to corkite (2Pb0.3Fe20a.2S03.P20 5.6H20), as showing 47 per cent of jarosite, 39 per cent of plumbojarosite, and 14 per cent of corkite.
Without being able to settle definitely the several questions involved, the following suggestions are tentatively advanced:
Specimen C is a plumbiferous jarosite-that is, essentially a jarosite with about ·one-fifth of 'the potash replaced by lead. No P205 is present.
Specimen B is probably the same as specimen C. Specimen A is a mixture of jarosite, plumbojarosite, a plumbiferous jarosite like C, and some other lead mineral probably of this group. Where the phosphoric acid belongs is not known. It may replace the ~03 in the jarosite, or it may be present as corkite or as some other mineral of this group. The isomor~ phous replacement of potassium by lead seems to yield a mixture of several members of the jarosite group and to introduce some P205 by replacing SOa. Possibly longer-continued reaction might result in the complete removal of the potash and might produce a single mineral species instead of a mixture.
Plumbojarosite (Pb0.3Fe203.4S03.6H20) is common in the Yellow Pine mine, where it forms compact ea.rthy brown masses and is locally abundant enough to ship as an ore of lead. It is probably widespread

in the district. The greenish bismuth-bearing variety of the Boss mine, which contained platinum and palladium (pp. 114-118), has not been found elsewhere.. According to W. T. Schaller, of the United States Geologieal Survey, a recalculation of the analysis quoted by Knopf indicates that the platinum, palladium, and gold present may be present as isomorphous mixtures in. the bismuth-bearing plumbojarosite. The potash-bearing plumbojarosite of the Kirby mine is discussed above..
·Beaverite 10 (CuO.PbO.Fe203.2S03.4H20) was collected in two localities-the Copperside mine and a
ofprosp.ect southeast th,e center of sec. 25, T. 24 S.,
R. 59 E. The name "vegasite" was given by Knopf 11 to a .
yellow ocherous mineral from the Rosella. prospect, the analysis of whieh indicated the formula Pb03.Fc203• 3S03.6H20. A reexamination of the original material by W. T. Schaller, of the United States Geological Survey, shows the presence of 2.53 per cent of P205, not recorded in the earlier ftnalysis but undoubtedly included with alumina. If, as appears probable, this phosphoric anhydride is present as a ferric plumbogummite, the remaining constituents are present in the same proportions as in plumbojarosite. A further careful determination of the optical character of the mineral indicates that it is negative, rather than positive as determined by Knopf. It is eoncluded, therefore, that the material is plumbojarosite.

MOLYBDATE

Wulfenite.-Wulfenite (PbMo04) was noted in a nu~ber of mines. It commonly forms the typical

square tabular crystals of orange to wax-brown

co]or. On the· 200-foot level of the Milford mine,

good specimens showing many needle-shaped pyram-

idal crystals were found. Like the vanadates, it is

generally in drusy cavities and is one of the latest

minera]s to be formed. At the l\1obile mine crystals

of wulfenite are covered with minute perfeet crysta]s

of calamine.

HYDROCARBONS

Along the southern border of the ore shoot explorecl' by the Azurite tunnel there were lenses of black material in the breccia zone that contained the ore. This material yields ·a heavy distillate and bituminous odor when heated in a closed tube but probably does not contain more than 10 per cent of volatile matter. Polished sections show numerous rounded lustrous black grains of bitumen in a matrix of black dolomite ·that doubtless contains minute disseminated grains of a hydrocarbon. Some of the black grains contain minute grains of chalcocite.

'I'hese efflorescences were conspicuously abundant in the workings of the Anchor, Azurite, Boss, Lavina, Lincoln~ and Potosi mines. In son1e places the efHqresceuce fonned a crust unifonnly distributed over the surfa.ce; elsewhere it fonned myriads of minute hairs as nnlCh as an inch long. In only one mine, the Lavina, did such n1aterial occur below known sulphides other than galena, from which sulphur in the fonn of sulphates might be derived.
As such efflorescences have clearly formed since the workings were 1nade, 10 to 20 years ago, and as there has been little O:\idation of sulphides in the ore deposits above the lowest levels since that time, samples were collected for analysis in the hope that they would throw Jight on the chemical character of the solutions that have recently passed through the rocks. The samples frmn the Boss and Lincoln 1nines were collect·ed from crosscuts more than 100 feet away from the ore zones. These san1ples have been tested by J. G. Fair.child, of the United States Geological Survey, whose i·eport is presented below:

GOLD DEPOSITS
During the progress of this investigation un-. weathered ·gold-bearing n1aterial was seen in but one locality-the Red Cloud mine. Here small quantities of gold are intimately associated with disseminated pyrite in serieitized porphyry. It is possible, as locally reported, that most if not all of the porphyry dikes or sills of the region, where they have been altered and slightly impregnated with pyrite, contain gold. The work on the Red Cloud dike seems to show that the weathered parts of such rocks are appreciably richer in gold than the part which is unweathered. The material that has yielded most of the gold of the region, however, is highly stained by hydrous oxide of iron and lies along fractures or faults, either on the contacts of the dikes or near by in the dolomite country rock or porphyry. If the ironstained breccia on the Keystone overthrust, reported to carry gold Jocally, is excepted, all the gold-bearing fractl,Ires lie in or within 1,000 feet of outcropping dikes or sills of porphyry.

mine, all the gol.d-bearing deposits ar~e almost completely oxidized to the depths of present work.
An unusual feature of all the gold deposits is the absence of veins or other masses of coarse white quartz, which forms the gangue of many gold-bearing veins. The origin of the iron-bearing chert associated with · th~ gold in some parts of the Keystone rnine is obscure. As it resetnbles that which contains cinnabar in the Red Cloud mine, it may have been formed during weathering. The pulverulent quartz reported from lenses in the Keystone mine was not seen in place.
A little copper is present at most of the places where gold ore has been n1ined. This as well as other elements indicates an intimate relation between the gold and copper deposits. Probably the prin1ary copper mineral was chalcopyrite.
In the structural history of the region the gold deposits clearly were fonned a.fter the intrusion of the porphyry, which they locally in1pregnat~, as well as after faults of the thrust epoch, at least as hite as the Keystone overthrust and the Ironside fault.
SILVER DEPOSITS
The Lavina mine and several prospects south of Crystal Pass are the only workings on deposits that yielded high assays for silver, but none have shipped ore. Proustite, tennantite, and pyrite in white quartz are the characteristic minerals at the Lavina, but only cerargyrite and son1e vanadates of lead were found at the other prospects. It is worth while to recognize the presence of the group because it appea.rs to be intermediate between the copper-bearing gold deposits and those. which largely contain copper, with little gold and silver. The silver deposits occur in or adjacent to granite porphyry aikes.
The silver content of the lead and zinc ores differs from place to place throughout the district pu~ is ·uniformly lower than in most of the other producing .areas in the region west of the Rocky Mountains.
The following table summarizes the range in silver -·content per ton of metallic lead in the ore of several mines, a c~msiderable part of whose output is lead ore.

A review of these assays, as well as ·others not presented, indicates (1) that the lead ore fron1 deposits near the principal intrusive masses of porphyry is higher in silver than that from remote deposits; (2) that oxidized material is uniformly richer, generally two or ~hree times richer, in silver than uno.xidized rnaterial, thus indicating an enrichrnent of silver during weathering; and (3) that concentration processes, wet or dry, applied to the oxidized ores, yield a concentrate richer in silver than untreated material containing the san1e percentage of lead.
The silver content of oxidized zinc minerals is uniformly lower than that of the lead nrinerals, commonly one-half to one-third, but sn1elters do not pay for it, as it is rarely recovered.
Inasrnuch as no mine in the district has shipped rnaterial completely unaffected by oxidation and therefore b-y possible enrichment, the range in grade of the unaltered n1inerals must be inferred. There seems to be no doubt, however, that, as indicated above, the sulphide minerals contain less silver than those from most of the other districts west of the Rocky Mountains. It is an interesting speculation whether this difference is related to the outstanding geologic feature!S of the districts, especially the character of the wall-rock alteration.
Although smelter analyses of a nun1ber of shipments of copper ores are available, the information at hand concerning their mineral composition is not adequate to determine the range and association of silver in them. Doubtless, the product of several mines, such as the Columbia, contained appreciable sulphides of copper, but the amount is not known. The silver content of all the copper ores is low, but it is least in those where the copper has clearly migrated appreciably from the original position of the chalcopyrite source. The highest silver content is probably that of the few shipments from the Lincoln mine, which ran as high as 35 ounces to the ton. Most shipments contained less than 10 ounces of silver to the ton, commonly 2 to 5 ounces.
COPPER DEPOSITS
Measured by their production of copper, according to custon1ary standards in the western United States, none of the deposits in this quadrangle are large, and the chance for discovering large or rich deposits here seems remote. On the other hand, the association of platinun1 and palladium with the copper minerals of several deposits is uncommon and, when considered in connection with the near-by deposits of gold as well as lead and zinc, raises son1e interesting questions con- · cernin~ their genesis.
Miuaalogy.-Probably malachite has been the 1nost abundant copper mineral in the shipn1ents from the mines, but chrysocolla and chalcocite h,ave locally been abundant. in son1e of the deposits dolomite stained by

COPPER DEPOSITS

ma.lachite has probably ma.de up most of the product. ''There sulphide minerals have been encountered chnJeocitc has been the 1nost abundant, and in most pln.ces, such as the Boss, Copperside, Azurite, and Columbia 1nines, it contains nuclei of chalcopyrite and bornite. The relations indicate clearly that chalcopyrite was the principal if not the only copper-bearing sulphide in rnost of the deposits before weathering. The presence of traces of copper arsenates in several pln,ces and of tennantite in the Lavina mine indicates that copper sulpharsenides were sparsely present in some of the unaltered deposits.
The relations of the original chalcopyrite to the countl'y roc.k are clear in only a few places, such as the Azul'ite and Columbia mines. (See pl. 28, A.) Here the mineral see1ns to fill angular dol01nite. breccia without the admixture of any other minerals.
The alteration of chalcopyrite to bornite and chalcocite without increase in volume demands that copper be brought to the site of deposition rather than tha.t iron be merely withdrawn. The small amount of chalcocite in the·· deposits is proof that such concentration of copper hn.s taken place only locally. On the other hand, the distribution of the oxidized copper minerals shows that during weatheriD:g the copper has been relatively dispersed fro1n the position occupied by the original sulphide. Where the eopper sulphide was originally mixed with fine-grained quartz, as in the Boss, Oro Amigo, Doubleup, and Keystone deposits, both the coppei· and the iron have been completely dissolved and removed to outer inclosing shells, leaving only fine pulverulent quartz. (See fig. 24.) The malachite shell is sharply separated from the inner lirnonite shell but. merges with the outer mass of dolomite. The uniformly n1eager silver content of the oxidized copper ores .may indicate that the origip.al sulphides contained little silver or that, like iron, the silver did not migrate so readily under weathering. Chrysocolla, copper pitch, and dioptase occur in small quantities and largely on open fractures. Their presence indicates a tendency of the carbonates of copper to dissolve slightly in surface solutions and to be precipitnted near by with the silica in those solutions.
T'he lack of a general tendency toward downward rnigration of copper a.ncl its local dispersion are probably due to the scanty rainfall of the region and the chemical character of the inclosing carbonate rock. The distribution of the oxidized zinc minerals also indicates that a small part of the rainfall readily finds its way to major fissures and descends to the deep water tn.ble, but the greater part merely wets a large vohuno of rock and is slowly returned to the surface and evaporated. The mineral deposits, therefore, are alternately slightly wetted and dried and the soluble materia.ls tend to migrate only locally outward toward the fracture through which the water entered.

Little is known concerning the mineral or minerals of the copper deposits that were the source of the platinurn and palladiun1 which are especially characteristic of the Boss deposit. There has been sufficient study of the platinun1-bea.ring plumbojarosite to show that native platinum is present, although it lacks the metallic properties con1monly eharacteristic of · that metal. The spongy fonn of the platinum suggests that it was once c01nbined with another more soluble element, such as sulphu.!' or arsenic. As sperrylite (platinum arsenide, PtAs2) is the only natural compound of platinun1 known, except certain alloys with similar metals, this may have been its source. There is a possibility that a part of the platinum, palladium, and gold are combined with iron oxide and sulphur trioxide as a complex plumbojarosite. (See p. 118.) In some parts of the Boss mine the associations of the masses of plumbojarosite indicate that they might have been concentrated from n1ore disseminated material. · The fine-grained gray quartz of the Boss deposit,. which contained octahedrite, is present on the Or<> Anugo and Doubleup claims also. It is an uncon1mon rnaterial, and its probable origin can only be inferred from its content of octahedrite.
Structural relations.-The bodies of copper minerals. that have been mined have diverse shapes and sizes,. but most of then1 are roughly tabular and underlie· persistent walls that cut across the local bedding of the rocks. Only two bodies-the one in the Columbia east shaft and the Blue Jay-lie roughly parallel to the local bedding. On the other hand, at 11 out of the 18 mines deseribed the bodies trend parallel to a. persistent fault zone or underlie loca.l walls that trend frorn north to N. 75° E. These 11 include the Bosst Copperside, Highline, and others on the west side of the range. In only three-the Ninety-nine, Azurite, and Lincoln-do the fractures trend northwest. Most of the overthrusts and reverse faults of the region trend north to northwest, and several faults that trend northeast, such as the Ironside and Tam o' Shanter, are reverse faults of the flaw type, probably formed late in the thrust epoch. It is believed that these copper-bearing faults and fractures belong to the same group. By contrast with the fractures that carry lead and zinc minerals, those which contain copper rninerals are more uniforn1 in attitude and relations~ The only significance that can be attached to this relation is tliat it is in harmony with the conclusion that some if not all of the early normal mineral-bearing faults represent a reversal ·of movernent along preexisting thrust faults.
Stratigraphic 1·elations.-Most of the copper deposits occur in Devonian or earlier rocks, although a few, such as the Ninety-nine and the Doubleup, occur as high i~ the section as the Bullion dolomite. Only in a few places, as in the Copper Chief, Alice, and·Mobile

92 GEOLOGY AND ORE •DEPOSITS OF GOODSPRINGS QUADRANGLE, NEVADA

mines do copper, lead, or zinc deposits occur near by at the same horizon. Most of the copper deposits lie near the belt of granite porphyry intrusions that occur above the Keystone overthrust.
Relations to igneous rocks.-As· shown in Plate 30, all .the copper deposits, except the Ninety-nine, Doubleup, and a sn1all deposit west of Wilson Pass, lie in an arc-shaped belt roughly parallel to the Keystone fault and the belt of porphyry dikes that occur above it. Dikes of porphyry that do not crop out were· also struck in the workings of the Boss Extension tunnel 1,000 feet north of the Boss mille and in the Columbia East shaft. The areal distribution of most of the copper deposits, even though· they are few in number, may therefore indicate a genetic relation to the porphyry intrusions. There is a similar relation of the gold deposits to intrusions, but the copper deposits are a little farther away..
Occurrence of cobalt.-Although cobalt oxide is. found in the wall-rock dolomite of nearly every copp,er deposit in the district and locally is abundant, as in the Co)umbia, there is nothing to indicate the primary mineral from which it was derived. The primary mineral may have been one of the common arsenides or sulphides, but obviously it was closely associated with a copper-bearing sulphide. The specimens from the Contact claim, even though showing none of the oxidized copper minerals near the pink cobalt-bearing uarbonate, contain dark-brown grains that give good tests for both metals. Though these grains are largely iron oxide, probably they were originally sulphide or arsenide minerals that contained the cobalt as well as the copper.
The most abundant cobalt mineral is the hydrous oxide, heterogenite, and the stalactitic form which it assumes' in many places indicates that, locally at least,· it was deposited directly from solution in open spaces. In some places, however, the cobalt appears to have been deposited first as cobaltous carbonate in near-by dolomite and then later oxidized to the black oxide. (See pl. 27, B.) As the result of both processes of alteration, first to carbonate and later to oxide, the cobalt has migrated some distance from the place where it was first laid down. In some places this distance is assuredly ·more than 30 feet; and elsewhere it may be 50 feet or more.
Even though traces of cobalt are widespread, the total quantity in the district is not large. About 20 tons of selected material containing from 6 to 29.18 per cent of cobalt has been shipped. Probably 200 tons of material containing 2 per cent or more of cobalt could be readily recovered from existing explorations.
LEAD AND ZINC DEPOSITS
Although there are a few deposits in the district that have yielded zinc alone, such as the lVfoute Cristo,

and a few that have yielded lead alone, such as the Ruth, Kirby, and Silver Gem, as a rule the two metals are intimately associated. As the differences in content of zinc and lead do not correspond with differences in form, stratigraphic position, or structural relations, deposits containing both metals wil1 be treated together.
HYPOGENE MINERALS
Even though zinc sulphide was observed in but two deposits, the Potosi and the Milford, where it was clearly the source of the more abundant carbonates and silicate of zinc, there can be no doubt that it was the prilnary source of the zinc in all the deposits. On the other hand, galena was observed at almost every deposit that has yielded lead, and beyond doubt it was the · principal primary lead mineral. There is a remote possibility that sulphides of lead containing arsenic or antimony were also present in a few deposits.
Evidence concerning the method of deposition of
zinc sulphide ill the containing carbonate rocks was
obtain~d at only one mine, the Potosi. Here part of the sphalerite was deposited as coarse crystals in open spaces of a dolomite breccia prior to the con1plete filling of the remaining space by. white dolomite and calcite, and another, probably smaller part was deposited in the dolomite fragments by repla.cing the carbonate rock. · (See pl. 28, B.) Probably the replacement of dolomite by zinc sulphide has rarely extended more than a few inches from open frac'tures.
The method of deposition of galena resembles that of sphalerite. In a few places it has been deposited as well-crystallized masses in open spaces, but n1ore widely it has replaced the dolomite walls. In many places the masses of galena are well-terminated crystals in the ·midst of coarsely crystalline gray dolomite. At the Anchor mine, where considerable galena has been deposited in opan fractures that were 'later filled with white dolomite, the sulphide occurs largely on the upper rather than the lower surfaces of the fractures. (See fig. 50.)
Probably the only other sulphide mineral that was common in more than a few of the zinc and lead deposits was pyrite or possibly but doubtfully marcasite. Neither mineial has yet been seen in most of the mines, but the abundance of linwnite, ferruginous chert, and n1inerals of the jarosite group indicates the .earlier presence of a sulphide of iron. Stibnite was found only in one area in the Yellow Pine 1nine. The presence of mimetite and annabergite in several deposits indicates the earlier presence of an arsenical sulphide, possibly arsenopyrite or lollingite, and the arsenides of nickel or cobalt.
Apart fr.om the dolomitized wall rock, the conlmonest gangue mineral associated with sulphides of lead and zinc was coarse white calcite, but coarse white dolomite is widely present, and both appear to

LEAD AND ZINC DEPOSITS

have been deposited largely, if not wholly, after the sulphides. Coarse white calcite cements fault breccias in many places ren1ote from ore deposits, where it appears to be .much younger than the metal sulphides. A little silica was deposited with the sulphide of lead in n1any places, but it has not been recognized near sphalerite. This silica takes the form of clear granular quartz filling pores in the dolomite (p. 57) and of very fine grained iron-bearing chert near the galena. Numerous polished sections of galena-bearing dolomite fr01n the Loolwut and Mountain Top deposits show a border of fine silica around the crystals of galena. 'I1ho association of silica with galena is also indicated by the presence of 5 to 15 per cent of insoluble matter in 1nany shipn1ents of high-grade lead ore. The lenses of granular quartz found in several copper deposits, such as the Boss and Doubleup, were not. noted in any of the lead and zinc deposits.
Barite is abundant in several deposits and may be more widespread, but it is not inthnately associated with the bodies of lead and zinc minerals. It replaces the wall-rock dolomite along persistent fractures.
From the foregoing staten1ents it seems clear that the 1nineralogy of the unweathered deposits of lead and zinc was unc01n1nonly simple.· Under the influence of weathering, however, a wide variety of minerals was formed-carbonates, sulphates, silicates, phosphates, vanadates, and arsenates.
ll'ORM OF ORE BODIES
If all details are considered the bodies of zinc and lead ore have complicated forms. This is not surprising when it is re.called that even though the bodies of sulphide minerals 1nay have been simple they have been 1nodified by migration and redeposition of zinc under the influence of the processes of weathering. In spite of these irregularities of detailed form, most of the ore bodies, as viewed broadly,· are tabular. The most distinctly tabular bodies include those of the Anchor, Monte Cristo, Kirby, Milford, Ingomar, and Tmn o' Shanter n1ines. The bodies of the Yellow Pine and Alice n1ines are tabular pipes, and the main shoot of the Sultan mine assun1es this form, although its structural relations are disti:n:ctly different from those of the other two bodies. Two extensive ore bodies, however, the Potosi and the Bullion, have generally similar forms that are unlike anything else in the district. These bodies ai:e limited upward and outward by distinct curved walls that appear to be parts of cones. In n1ost of the s1naller mines, even though exploration has revealed several detached bodies, each hTegular in form, their outer limits are tabular.
In the following discussion of the structural relations of the ore bodies, it will be the purpose to review those structural features of the deposits that appear to have detennined form and continuity.

STRUCTURAL RELATIONS
In this review attention will be directed to two groups of fractures, distinguished, on the basis of their apparent relation to the sulphide minerals, as premineral fractures and post1nineral ft·actures. The data used in distinguishing these fractures include the presence of sulphides, dolomitization, degree of cementation, size, and regional relations. The following criteria have been used in their discrimination:
(a) The presence of unbroken crystals or grains of blonde or galena in cemented dolomite breccia in a fracture is regarded as proof that it was formed before mineralization. Several such 1nineralized fractures have been found in the Yellow Pine and Milford tnines.
(b) If a breccia z~ne is wholly dolomitized and the fracture appears to have been the source of the dolomitization of the near-by walls it is regarded as premineral. Similarly, if the near-by walls are undolomitized the fracture is regarded as probably. postmineral.
(c) Most premineral breccias are firmly cemented by dolomite or white calcite; most postmineral breccias are not firmly cemented.
(d) If a breccia zone is clearly displaced by a fracture the breccia zone is appreciably older than the fracture, but obviously other criteria must be used to determine whether either or both are earlier or later than the sulphides of the area.
(e) In the absence of good local criteria sin1ilarity in regional setting of fractures indicates similar age. For e·xample, the Kirby and Rose mines lie in fracture zones that trend at right angles with the local folds; other near-by parallel faults, without apparent mineralization, probably have the same age-that is, premineral.
(j) The thickest breccia zones of the region are found on thrust faults, such as the several parts of the Sultan thrust, and all are premineral. In general, thick breccia zones occur on pre1nineral faults and thin zones on postmineral faults, but without confirming features this criterion must he used cautiously.
In· a region that has been frequently disturbed one would expect to find places where there has been postmineral 1noven1ent on pt·emineral faults. This may have occurred on a few fractures, such as that which the Star mine explores, but ·such movements do not appear to be common in the mines of ·the district.
As deterniined by these criteria most prenuneral breccias and fractures have two outstanding relations to the local. bedding-they either lie nearly parallel to the bedding in both strike and dip or cross the bedding with a large included angle. It should be noted, however, that the ore-bearing fractut·es of the Sultan and Hoodoo .mines lie in thick zones of thrust-fault breccias, and the conical fractures of the Potosi and Bullion mines form another distinct group. Most of

94 GEOLOGY AND ORE DEPOSITS OF GOODSPRINGS QUADRANGLE, NEVADA

the ore bodies have a broadly tabular form, and in

most of the mines it has been shown that this tabular

forn1 is determined largely by pren1ineral breccia

zones or fmctures. Some mines, such as the Yellow

Pine and Milford, show premineral fractures both

parallel and oblique to .the bedding and permit con-

clusions concerning their rela·tive age. A few other

mines, such as the Potosi, show two systems of pre-

mineral fractures without evidence as to their relative

age. In most of the mines, however, only one pre-

mineral fracture or group of fractures is shown,

although closer examination might reveal two. Ob-

viously, in drawing comprehensive conclusions con-

cerning the structural relations of the ore deposits,

emphasis must be placed upon the good evidence of

some deposits in contrast to the obscure features of

many other deposits.

·

Most of the lead and zinc deposits are listed below

according to the structural relations of the principal

bodies. The lists therefore record the relation of the

most productive premineral fractures or breccia zones

of each mine.

The existing workings of some of the deposits of the first group do not reveal the detailed structural relations. At a larger number, including the Yellow Pine, Prairie Flower, Alice, Anchor, and Mi1ford, the principal ore shoots occur in zones· of brecciated dolomite underlying persistent walls, and in some of these there are intersecting cross fractures that contain galena and are undoubtedly premineral, as in the Yellow Pine and Milford. At the YeJlow Pine mine also it has been proved that the breccia. zones which are nearly parallel to the local bedding are offset by and are therefore older than the cross fractures.

For this group of ore dep'bsits the conclusion ·is

reached that such breccia zones are thrust faults, in

large part local but possibly in part persistent both

horizontally and downward. On the other hand, the

second group of ore deposits bears a structural

·resemblance to the mineralized crosscutting fractun~s

of the first group.

·

The o.utstanding structural relations of four ore

deposits that have been omitted from the two groups

have some resemblance to those of the first group.

The 'Sultan and Hoodoo deposits tend to follow per-

sistent walls that cut thick thrust-fault breccias oblique

to their strike and dip. The conical breccia. masses of

the Potosi and Bullion deposits are cut by persistent

fractures that have the appearance of being premineral,

although positive criteria have not been obtained.

From this brief summary it appears that most of the

deposits for which there are good structural data belong

to two groups that seem to fit into a simple structural

setting. The smaller number of deposits lie along

fractures' that approximate plane surfaces, and most

of these have shown small yield. The larger number

of deposits lie in generally thicker breccia masses where

they are cut by younger fractures or faults, in part at

least, however, premineral. This second group in-

cludes the most productive deposits in the district.

The simplest and most reasonable explanation that

reconciles the structural relations of most of the ·de-

posits assumes that thrust-fault breccias were formed

rather early in the history of deformation and that for

the most part these breccias were larger arid nwre open

than those that were formed later along more simple

transverse fractures. Considered as channels for

access of ore-bearing solutions, the later transverse

fractures seen1 to have an advantage, for, as they are

nearly vertical and cross the beds, they would tend to

persist in depth. On the other hand, although major

thrust faults have been shown to persist over great

horizontal extent and probably persist in depth, they

have flatter dip, and solutions rising along them would

tend to take. advantage of any fractures leading more

directly to the surface. Minor thrust faults may be

related to local folding and pass in depth to bedding-

plane displacements or major thrust faults. It seen1s

reasonable, therefore, to regard the thrust-fault brec-

cias as highly favorable sites for deposition of ores and

the transverse faults as more favorable channels for

access of the ore-depositing solutions.

The bearing of this interpretation on the problems of

exploitation of the deposits is discussed on page 102.

96 GEOLOGY AND ORE DEPOSITS OF GOODSPRINGS QUADRANGLE, NEVADA

6,000 feet of limestone and dolomite. If all the deposits of lead, zinc, and copper were recorded here, regardless of structural association, the range would be only 4,000 feet, and 90 per cent ofall these lie within a zone_ scarcely 1,000 feet thick. From another standpoint n1ore than 95 per cent of.all the lead and zinc ore of the district has come from a zone scarcely 600 feet thick. This relation shows clearly that there 1nust be some feature or features of this zone that make it favorable for deposition of sulphides of lead and zinc. It has been pointed out already that deposition of sulphides appears to have-been detern1ined by structural elements rather than by chemical properties of the beds, as in some other district!'.
The outstanding physical differences between the productive and unproductive parts of the stratigraphic section concern the character of the bedding. The 600 to 900 feet of beds that make up the lower Mississippian section are distinctly more massive, homogeneous, and lacking in bedding planes than those above and below. Locally the Devonian beds become massive, but the overlying Pennsylvanian beds, as well as the underlying pre-Devonian beds, are _uniformly thin bedded. The overlying beds also contain numerous thin layers of sandstone and shale. In many places i:ri the district it is apparent that the massive beds are competent and determine the general character of the folding, whereas the overlying thin beds are intricately folded to accommodate themselves to ·the simpler forms of the massive beds. It would therefore seem that the massive beds are 1nore disposed to break and slip along the fqwtures than the overlying beds that would accornmodate themselves to stress by folding and slipping along the bedding. However this may be, it is clear that the zone of lower Mississippian beds is the most favorable in the search for ore deposits.
SUPERGENE MINERALS
On account of the effects of weathering the details of form and mineralogy of most of the ore bodies that have been mined bear only slight resemblance to those of the bodies of lead and zinc sulphides that were deposited originally. Not only have new minerals been formed, but the metals have migrated appreciably before the new minerals were deposited. The new lead minerals do not appear to have been deposited far from the original sulphide source, probably rarely more than a foot or two. On the othm hand, sufficient quantities of zinc. to form minable ore bodies have migrated from 5 to 50 feet and in a few deposits as much as 150 feet. This migration has taken place in spite of the fact that the walls of the ore bodies are made up of carbonate rocks that should readily react with the common soluble forms of zinc.
Lead minerals.-Galena was observed at nearly every deposit in the district that has shipped lead-

bearing material. It is not possible to state with confidence the proportion of lead that occurs as sulphide in the output of many deposits nor in the entire district. In some deposits, such as the ·Anchor, it has probabiy amounted to more than three-fourths ·of the total lead in the shipved product, but in others, especially the group that occurs in fractures which dut obliquely across the bedding, such as the Kirby and Tam o' Shanter, only traces of galena or none whatever was found. The galena of the latter group is rather uniforn1ly more completely weathered to· carbonate and to greater depth than that in the deposits that lie nearly parallel to the bedding. Doubtless such fractures offer a better opportunity for water to pass quickly downward to the level of permanent water.
The relations of galena, anglesite, and cerusite in this district closely resemble those in most other districts in the arid West and therefore do not warrant extended description. Only a little of the sulphate, anglesite, occurs as crystals in druses, under associations which indicate that it was deposited from solution after migration. Most of it forms a border around grains of galena or occupies completely the space once filled by galena. The simplest reaction by which galena oxidizes to the sulphate, PbS+ 40 = PbS04, indicates that if all of a given unit mass of galena weathered, the resulting anglesite would occupy about 50 per cent more space than the original galena; also that if anglesite replaces a crystal or unit mass of galena, without showing evidence of swelling, about one-third of the original lead present must have been carried away to open spaces near by. The_ relative abundance of anglesite and cerusite indicates that much more than one-third of the lead has migrated fro-m the site of the original sulphide.
The carbonate of lead, cerusite, was not noted adjacent to the sulphide, and where the two are near by they are separated by a film of sulphate. The carbonate commonly forms distinct crystals, either separate or in druses, or oc«urs as the typical grid of penetrating crystals that meet at an angle of about 60°. It was not found replacing the carbonate wall rocks, like the hydrous carbonate of zinc, nor in open fault breccias· remote from original sulphide bodies, like -the cal bonate of zinc. The hard masses of chert and cerusite from the prospects south of the Rose mine were probably formed in the same way as the jarositic cherts of the Kirby and other mines. (See p. 143.) The features and associations of the carbonate of lead, ~s contrasted with those of the sulphate, indicate that in most places the metal has migrated in solution as the bicarbonate a few feet before being deposited as the carbonate.
Among the other oxidized minerals of lead, the phosphate has assuredly formed locally by replacement of the carbona.te, but elsewhere, as in the Pil-

grin11nine, the origin of rather large pockets is obscurP.. A part of the plumbojarosite of the ICirby mine bas for1ned by the reaction of lead in solution with solid plumbic jarosite or even pure potassic jarosite, but elsewhere the 1nineral has been formed by the reaction between an iron sulphate in solution and solid cerusite. The several vanadates, although very stable at the present sm·face, appear to have been deposited from solutions many feet distant from the nearest other lead 1ninerals underground, as in the Bill Nye mine. The molybdate and arsenate of lead likewise have sin1ilar t·elations.
At the IGrby mine it seen1s clear that in the zone of oxidation there has been appreciable enrichn1ent of lead by tho progressive decomposition and re-formation of plumbojarosite, but this has not been an important fa.ctor in the forma.tion of lead-ore bodies elsewhere.
Zinc minerals.-Except in the two mines where zinc sulphide was observed, inferences concerning the 1nigration of ziri.c are based on the assumption that the sulphide was originally associated closely with tha.t of lead, as is common in otherwise si1nilar districts.
The most abundant zinc mineral in almost every deposit exa1nined in the district is hydrozincite, and it has probably been the most abundant in ship1nents to date. In this respect the district is unique in the western part of the Un~ted States. (See p. 98.) In most localities, except in a few of the largest deposits and in places where the hydrozincite lines drusy cavities, there is abundant good evidence that it has been formed by the replacement of dolmnite; in some localities it may have replaced limestone. In the largest masses, such as occurred on the 700-foot level of the Yellow Pine mine, where there was a pillar of nearly pure hydrozineite frmn roof to floor of the stope, 30 feet high, replacement of the dolon1ite is so co~­ plete that only faint traces of dolomite n1ay be found by close search. (See pl. 29, A.) The evidence of replacement is beautifully shown in some thin ~ections . under the n1icroscope. Thus, in a specimen from the AITowhead prospect traces of the rhombic cleavage of the dolomite are well preserved in the fairly crystalline hydrozincite. (See pl. 29, A.) Elsewhere the evidence of replacmnent rests on the recognition of detached rounded masses of dolomite in the midst of pure hydrozincite (pl. 28, G) and on the deposition of grains of the zinc mineral along cleavage planes of dolomite where large masses of the minerals .a.re in contact. In large bodies the process ·of replacement obliterates all traces· of the dolomite, and the resulting hydrozincite is either minutely granular (0.005 to 0.01 millimeter in diameter) or delicately plumose.
In a few deposits, as in the Monte Cristo· mine, smithsonite was abundant but not assuredly the most abundant rnineral. Where observed by the writer it was either an insignificant part of the larger bodies of hydrozincite or occurred in smaller bodies along frac-

ture zones beneath the principal deposits. Numerous bodies of the second group have been mined in the Yellow Pine mine, but 1nost of them 50 to 150 feet below larger bodies of hydrozincite. In such places the smithsonite has a cellular structure, as if it had been deposited i~ masses of angular dolomite that had later been dissolved a!ld carried away. (See pl. 28, 0.) As galena was not observed closely associated with such bodies, and as there was no other evidence that the fracture was premineral and may have contained zinc sulphide, the conclusion is reached that the zinc in the bodies of smithsonite is that which has been dissolved above, where it existed as sulphide or hydrozincite, and redeposited lower down.
Calamine is not and probably has no't been an abundant mineral, although small quantities are widespread. There is no evidence that it results from the replacement of any other zinc minerals, but the available evidence indicates that it either has been deposited in open spaces or, rather rarely, by replacing the carbonate w9.ll rocks, a.s in the Whale mine, or the layers of chert which they contain, as in the J\.ionte Cristo mine. In almost all deposits a few crystals of calamine· are scattered over the surface of nearly every other oxidized mineral, whether carbonate, sulphate, phosphate, vanadate, or n1olybdate. Sporadic small crystals of quartz have a similar widespread distribution and indicate that the latest waters that have filtered through the deposits have been saturated with silica.
The · general chernical features of the process of weathering, in so far as they concern zinc, may be briefly summarized. This examination does not indicate that much zinc sulphide is replaced in situ by oxidized zinc minerals, as may be noted with lead, so that only the process of deposition of migrating zinc in solution will be described. The reaction by which zinc sulphide oxidizes to zinc sulphate is well known ·and need .q.ot be reviewed. Some experimental work shows that the rate of oxidation of zinc sulphide is increased where sulphates of iron are present,14 but to judge from the small quantity of iron oxides in the oxidized zones of most of the lead and zinc deposits in the Goodsprings district, these salts have not greatly aided solution of zinc here. Much has been written ·concerning the chemistry of the solution and deposition of zinc ntinerals, but some of it has doubtful value because it is· based on speculation unsupported by experiment. The experiments by Wang 15 have a definite bearing upon conditions in the Goodsprings district and are confirmed by the mineralogy of the dis- · trict. Wang performed many cxperi1nents, but only those that bear on conditions here will be mentioned. He trea.ted a solution of zinc sulphate with a solution

In the ·reahn of ore deposits and lithology, good

examples of the widespread solution of silica or decOin-

of the chemical conditions under which solution of

silica takes place, has also been done. Places where

large masses a.re precipita.ted nea.r the surface, how-

ever, are rare. Recent experimenta.l work by Lover-

ing 22 has shown the degree to which several salts,

common in surface waters, affect the solubility of

several forn1s of silica and silicate minerals. This

work showed that among the common carbonates,

sulphates, and chlorides magnesium bicarbonate most

effectively dissolves the finer va.rieties of silica, such as

jasper, chalcedony, and opal.

GEOLOGY AND ORE DEPOSITS OF GOODSPRINGS QUADRANGLE, NEVADA

10 miles in diameter, the center of which lies 4 miles

southwest of Goodsprings. A few deposits lie north

of this area, a few lie northwest of it, and a few He

south of it, but except for a single prospected deposit

in the Bird Spring Range, none are kno~n east of it

for many miles. The deposits that have been ex-

amined within the quadrangle seem to conform in a

broad way to a zonal distribution around the intrusive

centers localized on the major thrust faults.

First, as viewed broadly, there are n10re ore deposits

in the belt overlying the Keystone thrust fault east of

the transverse Ironside fault than in all t_he rest of the

district. Within this belt lies a group of intrusive

masses of granite porphyry, beginning with the Key-

stone dike on the west and extending eastward to the

Lincoln mine. The porphyry sill in tb.e Boss Exten-

sion mine, which doubtless rises along the Ironside

fault, is one of this group. A second group of intru-

sive masses, smaller in number but larger in areal

extent, includes the Yellow Pine sill and 'the Lavina

dike. No intrusive porphyry masses a.re known in

the Spring Mountains north of the Yellow Pil}.e sill,

near the Snowstorm mine, for 40 miles or more, or

south of the Lincoln 'mine for 20 miles. As noted

earlier in this report, the thrust faults have undoubt-

edly determined the general distribution of the intru-

sive n1asses. These bodies of .intrusive rock have the

same structural relations as an enormous body of

quartz monzonite that crops out over an area of sev-

eral hundred square miles 20 to 40 miles south of the

Goodsprings district.

.

Next, as viewed in detail, there is a distinct tendency

toward zonal arrangement of the ore deposits in sev-

eral parts of the district. The ·ffiost productive gold

deposits--the I\.:eysto~e and Red Cloud-are wholly

in or adjacent to. bodies of intrusive porphyry, and

1ninor prospects, such as the Chaquita, are within

1,000 feet of outcropping intrusive masses. The

· deposits which have yielded high assays for silver but

which .have not been productive-the Lavina and

Crystal Pass-also lie· in or adjacent to porphyry

dikes. The iron-stained fault gouge of the Keystone

thrust is widely reported to yield fair assays for gold.

In the belt of rocks overlying the Keystone thrust

fault copper deposits tend to lie stratigraphically and

topographically below near-by lead and zinc deposits.

Thus the Boss, Highline, Copperside, Ros~, Columbia,

and Lincoln, as well as numerous snlaller deposits, lie

largely in Devonian or older rocks near the bases of

escarpments, whereas nun1erous zinc and lead deposits

lie in younger rocks on or near the crests of the escarp-

ments. An exception to this tendency is found in the

Kirby lead deposit, which lies within the belt of rocks

favored by copper deposits. The Alice, Yellow Pine,

Prairie Flower, and Pilgrim zinc-lead deposits lie in

higher beds than the riear-by Copper Glance and Snow-

storm copper deposits. In the· southern part of the

district the deposits that are higher both in altitude and in stratigraphic position tend to contain more lead than zinc. Porphyry masses were encountered in the Colun1bia and Boss Extension mines, although the copper deposits were near these masses rather than in them. Recently Emmons,26 in reviewing the relations of rr1etalliferous deposits to intrusive rocks, included a · brief summary of the deposits of the Yellow Pin~ district as described by ~ill and concluded that "the deposits are not clearly separated into zones, and there is evidence of some overlapping of copper deposits." Oln the writer's opinion the ore deposits are separable into several groups, in at least two of which there is a distinct tendency toward a zonal arrangement of the deposits, and especially in the part of the district that contains most of the deposits.
The causes that account for the failure of the Kirby and some other .deposits that lie outside the central part of the district to conform to a simple zonal arrangement can only be conjectured. Only zinc and lead deposits are known in the. southwestern part of the district, and among these only a slight tendency toward zonal arrangement may be noted. The causes of the local distribution of the zinc and lead deposits M-re probably to be sought among their structural and stratigraphic relations. It seems fairly probable, however, that buried bodies of intrusive rock underlie small areas in the southern part of the district.'
The relations described conform with the general distribution of gold, copper, zinc, and lead deposits as set forth by Spurr. ·
The question may well be raised as. to what features have controlled the localization of many sporadic outlying deposits, notably the Potosi zinc and Ninety-nine and Doubleup copper deposits and others in the southern part of the district, most of which are 4 to 7_ miles from the nearest surface outcrop of porphyry. A brief examination of the Potosi deposit by Bain/7 in adyance of a comprehensive knowledge of the areal geology of the district, yielded the impression that the deposit had no relation to intrus~ve igneous rocks, such as most observers have concluded to exist for the zinc and lead deposits of the Mississippi Valley. In the light of the present knowledge of the central part of the Goodsprings district this conclusion was premature, but now, as then, in attempting to deduce confident conclusions, one is han1pered here, as in n1any other places, by lack of knowledge concerning unexposed, possibly slightly buried bodies of igneous rock.

For n1ost of the ore deposits there are at least two essential structural features-a channel of access for the metal-bearing solutions and a site of deposition. In a few deposits a thhd structural feature appears in the for1n of postlnineral fractures, along which movement has displaced the bodies prior to weathering. In places the channels of access may be s1nall and inconspicuous, so that they are found only after close search, but elsewhere they are large enough to warrant Ininmg. The criteria for their recognition are given on page 93. The sites of deposition are comrnonly the zones of dol01nite breccia which lie nearly para1lel to the bedding. They are nuiCh more conspicuous than the channels of access, but the ore n1inerals are sporadically distributed in them. It has frequently happened in the district that with exploitation ore has been exhausted from a bedded breccia zone, and the operator is forced to do exploratory work in search of new bodies. ·Generally he has chosen to do this by pursuing the breccia zone laterally or in depth, not uniformly with success. It is suggested that in such situations, if the breccia zone is relatively high in the favored part of the stratigraphic section (seep. 95), the operator should consider the wisdom of sinking deeper on recognized crosscutting premin.eral fractures in the hope of finding ore where they intersect lower breccia zones. Such superposed parallel breccia zones have been found only in several places in the Yellow Pine and Anchor 1nines, but the fact that they exist justifies their consideration.
The migration and redeposj tion of zinc under the influence of weathering create some problems in exploitation that are not widely understood ir1 the district. Such secondary 1ninerals as s1nithsonite and calamine represent zinc that has migrated downward fron1 the original source. Where bodies of ;:;uch n1inerals fail in depth, it is generally unwise to explore deeper; it would be better to explore upward un1ess the bodies in that direction have already been exhausted. The presence of som~ galena in the oxidi~ed zinc minerals is the only trustworthy evidence that they occupy their original position or lie in a premineral fracture or breccia that can be explored with confidence.
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE MINES
GOLD MINES
RED CLOUD MINE
Location and history.-The Red Cloud n1ine (No. 10, pl. 30) is near the road to Wilson Pass, about 4 miles northwest of Goodsprings. The deposit was located by J. C. Arn1strong in January, 1902~ A little work was done between that year and 1904, but most of the present work was done between July, 1905, and September, 1907. Early in 1906 a small cyanide plant

was installed and operated almost continuously until

September, 1907.

Most of the workings explore a granite porphyry

dike about 65 feet wide that trends N. 40° Vol. and

rnay be traced about 1,500 feet by outcrops and pros-

pects. The adjn.cent rocks are sn1oky-gray dolo-

mitized limestones of the Bird Spring formation,

perhaps 500 to 800 feet above the base. These n,nd

higher beds were probably limestone originally, but

they are now dolomitized over an irregular area that

extends westward beyond Wilson Pass. The dolo-

mitized beds overlie the Potosi thrust fault, which lies

under the wash east of the mine. Ncar the mine

There are several shafts at the southeast end of. the

dike, but the deepest and the one from which the

production of the mine was .made lies north of the

centra.l part. This shaft is vertical to a depth of 116

feet and is inclined at 65° thence to the bottom, 300

feet below the collar. There are levels at 34, 87, 136, 190, and 300 feet. Only the workings on and t bo~e

the 87-foot level were examined, for below that level

the're was serious caving of the shaft. (See fig. 16.)

According to Mr. Armstrong, the principal sources·

of ore were three shoots. One lay above the 34-foot

level and southeast of the old shaft; another extended

fron1 the 34-foot level to the 87-foot level, northwest

of the old shaft; ttnd a third extended from the 87-

foot level diagonally downward toward the 116-foot

level in the new shaft. Only the second of these

sho.ots could be examined. It covered an area about

25 by ·50 feet, and t.he width ranged from 4 to 10 feet.

The stope followed the southwest or footwall contact

of the dike with the dolomite, and both materials seem

104

to have been mined. The contact is marked by sporadic lenses of dark-brownish chert, which the microscope shows to be microgranular and to contain sparsely distributed grains of a brown oxide of iron that was probably fornwd during weathering.
As exposed by crosscuts on the 87-foot level, a part of the pyritized porphyry is oxidized, and another part, generally a central core, is unoxidized. All .the ore that yields the highest assays for gold, as well as that which has been stoped, is oxidized, whereas the unoxidized part is of lower grade and generally contains only $1 to $3 worth of gold to the ton. It is reported that there was much less oxidized porphyry on the 300-foot level than above, and almost the entire dike was unweathered.
According to Mr. Annstrong, it was the aim in operating the cyanide plant to supply ore that was valued at $9 to $12 a ton, and this range was maintained during a part of the period of operation. The only accurate records available cover the period from February to July, 1906, and are presented. in the following table:

Free gold has never been seen in Red Cloud ore. . The opinion prevails that it must have been very fine, and this is confirmed by the good extraction obtained at the cyanide plant-65 to 90 per cent of the gold fr01n material crushed to pass rolls set 1 inch apart. The fin.eness of the bullion from the cyanide plant ranged fr01n 0.700 to 0.880, but the silver content was low.
Other than the iron oxides and silica· in the oxidized ore, the only mineral observed was cinnabar. This mineral was found here and there in sufficient quantity to forn1 an appreciable part of the cyanide precipitate. In the specimens collected by the writer it occurred as small round grains in the ferruginous chert, probably formed during the process of weathering.
There is no record of the total production; probably it did not exceed $20,000.

CHAQUITA MINE

On the Chaquita clairn (No. 21, pl. 30), 3,000 feet west of the Keystone, nearly 1,000 feet of work has been done. Here the dark-gray dolon1ites near the

middle of the Goodsprings forn1ation strike west and dip about 5° S. Most of the work has been done at two tunnels and a shaft near the top of a low knoll. These openings explore son1e siliceous limonite lenses that lie parallel to the bedding of the dolomite. The lowest tunnel, 310 feet long, was driven under these workings but cut no vein. Although good assays for gold are reported, no ore has been milled.
There are a number of other tunnels and shallow shafts within 2,500 feet northwest and southeast of the Keystone mine, most of which explore either porphyry dikes or their contacts with the dolomite beds of the Goodspriilgs formation. The total length of these workings must be 3,000 or 4,000 feet, but as little authoritative information could. be obtained concerning them,· and as they yield no significant geologic data, tl;tey will not be. described.
KEYSTONE MINE
Location.--The Keystone 1nine (No. 22, pl. 30) is the most productive of the group near the head of Keystone Wash, on the west slope of the Spring Mountains. Although ·scarcely 5 miles due west of Goodsprings, the mine is 12 miles distant by the road over vVilson Pass. The workings lie near the base of a prominent ridge and are readily accessible by the road up Keystone Wash. (See pl. 31, A.)
Although the Keystone Claim was first located in 1882 by Joseph Yount and others, no work was done before 1888, when it was relocated, with· the adjoining Honduras claim, by t.Tonas Taylor. In 1892, after a .little work had been done, rich ore was struck, and a shipment of 10 tons to Pueblo yielded $7,160.39 In June, 1892, S. T. Godbe, of Salt Lake City, purchased z:m interest for $20,000 and active exploration was begun. A 10-stamp mill was built at Sandy, 6 miles southwest, in 1893, and it is reported 4J that this mill was operated continuously through that year and yielded $30,000 a n1onth. During a part of this period the ore treated averaged $92.20 in gold to the ton. In June, 1895, the company was in financial difficulties, and a receiver was appointed. The mine was operated intern1ittently thereafter until 1897, when it was closed downY During this early period of work four tunnels were driven and the old shaft from tunnel 3 was sunk to a depth of 530 feet. Operations were conducted at great disadvantage, as the nearest source of supplies was 11anvel (later Barnwell), 80 miles distant.
In May,· 1902, the Nevnda-ICeystone Mining Co. was fonned to take over the property, and the rnine was operated for two and one-half years. During this period the new inclined shaft was sunk to a pOint 820 feet below tunnel 3, or 1,000 feet below the outcrop, and the deposit was explored to nearly the present

und Golden Chariot mines, is clearly a sill several hundred feet thick, but it may connect with the Keystone dike in depth. Two thousand feet east of the Keystone another dike has been explqred by prospects. It is scarcely 100 feet thick and trends southeast, parallel to the Keystone thrust, but appears to dip more steeply locally. Another smaller dike of irregular form lies 3,500 feet west of the Keystone n1ine, just east of the ·Chaquita mine; it may be a faulted portion of the west end of the Keystone dike. In several places, both in the Keystone mine arid elsewhere, there are angular ·blocks of dolomite, as much as 3 feet in diameter, wholly inclosed in the porphyry. None of these blocks show the common evidence of contact metamorphism.
It appears to be characteristic of these dikes, as of 1nost of the others in the district, that they produce no visible alteration in the adjacent and near-by carbonate rocks, either in the form of bleaching or by the development of new minerals. Wherever the porphyry is explored by prospects or mines the texture and mineral P.Ontent appear to be the same, but locally it shows an advanced state of alteration. In. most places, although the rock may break into angular blocks, these largely disintegrate to rounded masses or fine debris after brief exposure on· the surface. In the Keystone mine these blocks are bounded by joints, but they show sheared surfaces. Masses near the contact with dolomite are generally most decomposed, and the feldspars are replaced by a reddish soaplike mineral, possibly halloysite. Old records report that the porphyry was locally impregnated with pyrite, probably like the Red Cloud dike, but this was not noted., although a new shaft sunk in 1916 near the north edge of the Keystone dump struck veins of pyrite and barite in the porphyry.
No faults that are conspicuous on the surface were noted near the Keystone, but there are many small faults underground. Some of these _are undoubtedly postintrusive and premineral, but others are probably postmineral.
The deposit.-The Keystone mine explored several shoots of gold ore, of which the two most productive lay along the contact of the porphyry dike and the inclosing dolomite. In several places gold-bearing material was mined from. veins wholly in the porphyry; in other places from veins wholly in the dolomite; and in still others from veins in faults that disturb both rocks.
The porphyry dike trends nearly north and dips 30° W. It is broken by faults of several varieties, however. and in some places it is not clear whether the irregularities of form are original or are due to faulting. The accessible workings above the 300-foot level largely explore shoots on the upper contact of the dilce with the dolomite (fig. 17), but from the 300-foot level down ward mQst of the work is on the lower contact <?f

the dike. As a result of the necessarily brief examination made by the writer, the impression was obtained that some of the shoots on the upper contact, worked above the 300-foot level, have not been explored below that level. Most of the stopes range from 2 to 3 feet wide, but wider stopes are not uncommon, and some as much as 8 feet wide are reported.
A vein wholly in dolomite lies 50 feet south of the new shaft on the No.3 tunnel level and has been stoped over a width of 2 to 3 feet for a length of 20 feet. On the 300-foot level south of the shaft, ore has been stoped over an area 20 by 30 feet which is limited by a conspicuous footwall that trends N. 20° W. and dips 25° NE. This wall appears to be a fault that separates porphyry above from dolomite below, and the stoped material was wholly porphyry. In its attitude and structural relations it is unlike most other stopes in the mine. On the 300-foot level north ore was stoped from the lower contact of the porphyry, and it was terminated southward by a fault that trends northwest and dips northeast.
An interesting structural feature is found on the 100-foot level, where the relations indicate that faults of the thrust group which probably carried some ore have been formed after the intrusion of the porphyry. (See fig. 18.) South of the shaft the exposures indicate clearly that the porphyry dike is cut obliquely and dragged along a fault that trends northward, the east side moving north and probably up\vard with respect to the west side. Although the exposures on the north side of the shaft are good, the r~lations might be explained in several ways but are not inconsicstent with the explanation offered.
At points in the shaft 20 and 25 feet above the 540-foot level there are two faults. The first trends N. 10° W., dips 50° NE., and cuts off a 2-foot sill of porphyry; the second. trends N. 20° W., dips 35° NE., and drops dolomite above against dolomite below. To judge by their attitude and relations they may belong to the late normal group and be postmineral; they are assuredly postintrusive.
The principal evidence of mineralization in the stoped areas ·is abundant limonite, both as cubes, which indicate its derivation from pyrite, and inlpregnating decomposed porphyry. Manganese. oxide, generally wad, is present at many places. In some places dark chert forms thin veins on the li:p1iting surfaces of porphyry, as .well as in the dolomite near by, but it is not abundant, and the common varieties of vein quartz were not observed at any place. Old records indicate that here and there in the upper levels lenses of pulverulent quartz were found inclosed in shells of limonite and copper carbonates, such as are characteristic of the ore shoots at, the Boss mine (fig. 24), but none were seen by the writer. Chrysocolla was noted on the 300-foot level north, where ore was stoped from the lower contact of thP. dike.

GOLD MINES

107

According to old records, as well as the testimony

CLEMENTINA MINE

of n1iners interviewed by the writer, the gold in the ICeystone 1nine was characteristically associated with a greenish talcose mineral, probably one of the clays. This mineral and clay heavily stained with limonite were the guides in stoping, although some high assays wore obtained fro1n dark chert. Specimens of the clay allowed to disintegrate in the mouth yielded either a Inass of wire gold or irregular grains and threads of gold. The c01nposition of the bars of bullion recovered fron1 the amalgan1 in the mills indicates that the range in fineness of the gold was ru.ther constant at 0.920 to 0.930, and that it was therefore uncommonly pure. The bullion from the cyanide plant was not so pure, the fineness ranging from 0.820 to 0.900 if base metal is ignored.
The average grade of the ore is shown in the table of 1nonthly records of Inill operation. During the veriod from May, 1902, to October, 1904, the value of

The Clen1entina mine (No. 23, pl. 30) lies about 3,000 feet southeast of the l{~eystone. The claim was one of several located early in 1892, when it becarne apparent that there was high-grade gold ore in the Keystone mine. The worlcings include a shaft 75 feet deep and a tunnel 110 feet long, with a shaft 75 feet deep near the entrance. In this area the dark dolomites about 2,000 feet below the top of the Goodsprings formation strike northwest and 9-ip 5° to 10° SW. The principal source of the gold produced is a shear zone that trends N. 50° W. and dips steeply southwest, along which there were lenses and irregular masses of gold-bearing ferruginous chert, slightly stained with malachite and chrysocolla. This deposit is eredited with having shipped 13 tons of material to the smelter which yielded a total of 10 ounces of gold, 8 ounces of silver, and 522 pounds of copper.

According to Anderson's reports, the ore shoots were most productive where the vein was flatter than the average, and he emphasizes the fact that the productive area between the 100 and 200 foot "levels was found where the dip was only 18° instead of 40° to 50°, as above and below it.
A question of considerable interest, with respect to the genesis of the deposit and its future exploitation, is concerned with the quantity of gold in the porphyry dike. Through the early work it was recognized that the rock contained appreciable quantities of gold, and it is locally clain1ed that most, if not all, of the dikes of the region contain more than the traces of gold con1mon

The Golden Chariot elaim (No. 24, pl. 30) lies half a mile west of the Keystone mine. The principal exploration is a tunnel that trends generally southe-ast for about 200 feet. The worlcings explore several iron-stained shear zones that trend northwest and dip northeast and are wholly in a sill of geanite porphyry. There are two sn1all stQpes above the tunnel level, one of which extends to the surface. Several hundred tons of materi~l from the stopes has been milled at the Keystone mill, and the value of the gold recovered is variously reported at $20 to $40 a ton. In 1916 Harvey Hardy, of Goodsprings, shipped about 13 tons of copper-bearing ore from this claim that yielded the following retut·ns fmm the smelter: Gold, 0.105 ounce to the ton; silver, 0.45 ounce to the ton; copper, 14.65 per cent; iron, 18 per cent; insoluble, 33.80 per cent.

All the ore from this mine was taken from the surface to a depth of 260 feet, where it played out, from stopes running · not over 80 feet east of the shaft. The ore is sorted at the mine, and of 25 cars shipped in the fall of 1912 none ran below 20 per cent of copper, and most of it averaged 24 to 25 per cent.

According to local report, the gross value of the ore shipped from the mine is about $40,000, which would indicate about 1,000 tons of 20 to 30 per. cent copper ore. The extent of the stope indicates that this estimate is high; probably the tonnage lies between 500 and 750 tons. The latest shipment (1918), of 10 tons, contained 18.2 per cent of copper, 11.5 per cent of iron, 5.3 per cent of insoluble matter, and 0.95 ounce of silver to the ton.

BLUE JAY MINE
The principal workings on the Blue Jay claim (No. 7, pl. 30), which lies 4 miles northwest of Goodsprings, are two inclined shafts that attain a maximum depth of 35 feet. In this area the country rock, Bullion dolomite, is much crushed, doubtless by the Contact overthrust, which lies not . far below the surface, probably about 200 feet. The shafts· explored two ·lenses of copper-bearing ore, and although little could be seen in place underground there was on .the dump several tons of material that contained copper and cobalt minerals. Apparently the copper, as well· as the cobalt minerals, lay along fr,actures that trend N. 30° W. and dip 55° NE., roughly parallel to the bedding.
The deposit is interesting because it has yielded unusual mineral speCimens. At one place some drusy cavities yielded excellent crystals of malachite, pseudomorphous after azurite, as much as an inch long. In 1921 cobalt minerals were recognized on the dump, and A. Woodard, of Las Vegas, mined the cobaltbearing material recorded below. In the material on the dump heterogenite was common, in part replacing the dolomite wall rock and in part forming slender stalactites, on some of. which quartz has been deposited. Some specimens show a pale-pink dolomite that cements gray dolomite. Blowpipe tests show that the pink dolomite contaills an appreci11ble trfl.ce of cobalt.

and smaller shafts and open cuts within an area 500 . feet in diameter. All these explorations are in the
Bullion dolomite. The most }!roductive exploration is an open cut on the east side of the ridge, which follows a breccia zone parallel to the bedding. From this open cut 76 tons of low-grade ore was shipped. According to Mr. Feaster, the owner, the material was si1nllar to that exposed in the open cut-dolomite breccia cemented by malachite. The total output from the claims is 93 tons of copper ore, most of which contained from 5 to 12 per cent of copper; one lot of 6 tons contained 18 per cent of copper.
At the south end of the. ridge a shallow pit has exposed a vein nf clear gray barite 12 to 18 inches thick, which lies parallel to the bedding of the inclosing rock. ·
GREEN COPPER MINE
The Green Copper claim (No. 13, pl. 30) lies in the
NE. X sec. 20, T. 24 S., R. 58 E., south of the Yellow
Pine Mining Co.'s railway. The principal exploration is a tunnel about 125 feet long that explores a shear zone in the upper part of the dolomitized Anchor limestone. There is also a winze mclined 52° and 35 feet deep to a short drift. The shear zone is probably associated with the northeast extension of the Alice fault. According t.o Allen Campbell, son of the original owner, the mine has yielded two carloads or about 75 tons of copper ore that probably contained 15 to 20 per cent of copper.
There is little copper-bearing material left in the mine, but the source of the production was undou btedly two small stopes above the level and an open cut at the entrance of the tunnel. These stopes underlie well-defined walls that trend generally eastward and dip· south. Apparently copper carbonates and silicates were associated with lenses of iron-stained chert which are conspicuous oii. the surface. Several· lenses of chert were apparently associated with the walls, but others that are unmined have no close relation to· the ·walls. . The chert is sporadic and does not persist downward to the lower level. H~re, as at the Oro Amigo and Kirby mines, the walls aro neither regular nor persistent. They appear to be the minor fractures that limit lenses in a wide shear zone.

COSMOPOLITAN CLAIM
The Cosmopolitan claim (Np. 18, pl. 30) is on the south side of Lavina Wash, in the SE. X sec. 29, T. 24 S·., R. 58 E. The principal work is a vertical shaft about 100 feet 'deep that was sunk along a shear zone that trends N. 15° E. and dips 85° SE. It is now inaccessible, but from what may be seen from the surface and on the dump, the shear zone was silicified and contained some copper minerals. Within 300 feet to the southeast there are four small shafts and tunnels, from which small quantities of copper-bearing material were mined. The zone explored by the deepest shaft appears to be the fault along which the eastern block of the Keystone thrust is dropped several hundred feet

of the company in 1916. The only production is a single car of copper ore, shipped in.1917. The shipment weighed 18 tons and contained copper, 17.17 per cent; iron, 12.20 per cent; insoluble matter, 28.50 per cent; gold, 0.15 ounce to the ton; and silver,~~0.5 ounce to the ton. According to Knopf/3 H. K. Riddall made nssays on material from this deposit that contained as much as 0.51 ounce of gold and 0.11 ounce of platinum to the ton.

BELLE OR MAYBELLE CLAIM
The Belle claim (No. 19, pl. 30; locally known as the Maybelle) lies on the divide between Lavina Wash and a ravine that drains southwest to Mesquite Valley, in the south-central part of sec. 29, T. 24 S., ·R. 58 E. The workings include a shaft more than 100 feet deep, now inaccessible, and several tunnels and shallower shafts. These workings explore a silicified shear zone that strikes N. 60° W. and dips 80° NW.; the country rock is. the Bird Spring formation. The dump material shows considerable manganese oxide aod small quantities of chrysocolla and a yellow vanadate.
The local rock exposures indicate· that the shear zone lies in a block of dolomitized Bird Spring limestone that overlies the Contact thrust and is limited on the south by the Keystone thrust and on the west and east by later normal faults. If extended 100 feet farther, the deepest shaft would pass into beds under the Contact thrust, prQbably the lower part of the Moenkopi formation.
Although copper-bearing material has probably been shipped, no record of the.quantity has been obtained.
ORO AMIGO MINE
The Oro Amigo-Platino Mi.Qing Co. owns a group of four claims (No'. 20, pl. 30) that cover some low hills south of the mouth of Keystone Wash, in the
E. %sec. 23, T. 24 S., R. 57 E. Three claims· were
located in June, 1905, and the fourth in 1917. There was some exploration from an upper tunnel in the early days, but most of the work, including the lower tunnel, 600 feet long, was done after the incorporation

fracture zone is most conspicuous in the upper tunnel, where it trends nearly east and is made up of a group of minor nonpersistent walls of divergent strike and· dip. The ore that was shipped represented copperbearing material that occurred on the borders of lenses of ferruginous chert. These lenses generally overlie the minor fractures. Although the main tunnel (fig. 20) explores the same zone 50 feet lower, the fractures are much less conspicuous and contain less chert and only sporadic traces .of copper. One stope is 10 by 10 feet and 4 feet wide. On the. sublevel, 30 feet lower than the main tunnel, there are only traces ·of copper.
The ore minerals include the oxidized copper minerals-malachite, azurite, copper pitch, and chryso-

Here, as at the Copperside rnine, the copper minerals form a thin layer around the borders of the lenses of ferruginous chert. In the zone explored from the surface to a maximum depth of 100 feet there is an impressive decrease in the quantity of chert as well as co.pper minerals.
HIGHLINE MINE
The property of the Red Streak Mining Co. includes two claims-the Red Streak and Highline (No. 25,

20 feet below. It explores a shear zone 3 to 5 feet wide that trends north, parallel to the bedding, but dips 60° W. and therefore cuts across the bedding of the dolomite in depth. The zone is explored to a lower level by a shaft 65 feet deep at an inclination of 58°, but there is no stoping at this depth.
The total production from these claims, 477 tons of copper ore, had a gross value at the smelter of $54,687 and a net value after deducting freight and charges of $50,337. The average copper content, about 35 per cent, is the highest in the district. The silver content ranged from 0.35 to 1.1 ounces to the ton and the gold from 0.04 to 0.085 ounce to the ton. Insoluble mate• rial averaged about 11 per cent and the iron content about 12 per cent. During 1921 Frank Williams mined and sorted from the dump two lots of cobalt ore that showed .the following returns: Lot 1, weight 4,820 pounds, cobalt 6.35 per cent; lot 2, weight .I ,200 pounds, cobalt 12.45 per cent.
Th~ ore that can now. be seen underground and on the dump is almost completely oxidized, and positive conclusions concerning the original minerals and their associations can not be stated. A little chalcocite can be found here and there, but it is the only sulphide observed. The most abundant material is a mixture of chrysocolla, tenorite, malachite, and cobalt oxide in a gangue of ferruginous chalcedony. Fractures are commonly coated with chrysocolla, upon which crystals· of dioptase are distributed. The dolomite iri and near the shear zone locally contains black mottlings of cobalt oxide. Probably the original ore was dolomite breccia slightly silicified, with veins and lenses of chalcopyrite and a cobalt sulphide. The present workings indicate that the shoots are sporadically distributed in the shear zone. The tonnage shipped indicates that an unusually large part. of the shoot contairied copper ore of good grade.

COPPERSID:ffi MINE
The Copperside claim (No. 26, pl. 30) lies on the
north side of a high ridge in the E. Y2 sec. 26, T. 24 N.,
R. 57 E. It is owned by F. Renaux and 0. F. Schwartz, of Goodsprings. The principal work is a tunnel about 250 feet long from which there are s.everal shafts and winzes to a level 30 feet lower and about 100 feet long. (See fig. 22.) The total production is 621 tons of copper ore whose gross value at the smelter was about $55,000 and whose net value was about $46,000.

According to the srnelting receipts,·the copper content of the shipn1ents ranged frorn 13.8 to 36;5 per cent, with the average about 24 per .cent. Iron ranged fro1n 7.7 to 16.5 per cent, insoluble 1natter from 4.3 to 19.4 per cent, gold fmm nothing to 0.18 ounce to the ton, and silvee fron1 0.10 to 1.20 ounces to the ton.
The mine workings lie about 200 feet above the base of the Sultan limestone and the beds trend nearly due
north and dip 15° vY. Two distinct shoots of ore
have been the s0urce of the production, and both underlie well-defined hanging walls. ~he inner oe westeen shoot underlies a well-defined wall that trends N. 20° E. and dips 40° W.; the outer or eastet·n shoot underlies a wall that trends N. 30° W. and dips 45° SW. The inner shoot has been stoped over an irregu-· lar area about 40 by 50 feet and to a tnaxin1un1 height of 15 feet. The outer shoot has. been stoped over an

area 30 by 40 feet and to a height of 10 feet. In the shoots the ore .formed lenses that lay generally parallel to the bedding-that is, flatter than the hanging walls. At present the lenses are made up largely of oxidized minerals, but sotne contain central 1nasses of chalcopyrite, bornite, and chalcocite, in which the last two minerals have been derived ft·onl the first by weathering. One lens remaining in place is 10 t.o 15 feet wide, 1 to 3 feet thick, and of indefinite length. It contains a central core that is largely jai·osite and brownish ferruginous chert. This eore is sunounded by a border of li1nonite, and this in turn by an outee zone that contains copper cttrbonate and silicate minerals. It seen1s clear that in this locality. jamsite is first forn1ed as one of the oxidation products of chalcopyrite and that as weathering progresses ·the jarosite itself is decomposed to hydrous oxide of iron. The silica is largely chert, but crevices are coated with crystals of quat·tz, one of the latest minerals to fonn. Probably the silica is wholly supergene.
In this nline, as in the Azurite nline near by, the two shoots are not on the same fracture zone but on roughly parallel zones.

SWEEPSTAKE PROS·PECT
The Sweepstake claim is near the center of sec. 25, T. 24 S., R. 57 E., on the north side of the divide between drainage going northwest toward the Oro Amigo n1ine and southwest toward the Mobile mine and Sandy. Although no shipn1ents of ore have been made, the deposit is interesting because it prec;;ents unusual and in·teresting relations of silica and several sulphate minerals. A tunnel that extends southwest 30 feet and then southeast 20 feet explores two lenses of silicified liinestone that are about 10 feet long and 2 feet wide. Smaller lenses are explored by trenches
ma-for a distance of 300. feet, and there is a conspicuous
outcrop of brown ferruginous chert. The silicified terial contains traces of several oxidized lead and copper minerals, but more iriterest is attached to the sulphate n1inerals-jarosite, plumbojarosite, and beaverite.
The waste n1aterial on the dumps presents a wide range of colors, fron1 white through dull olive-green and yellow to brown and red. By close examination it is found that the white material consists of clean chert of 1,11inutely granular texture. The transition fron1 white to yellow and olive-green is· abrupt in sOine places and gradual ·elsewhere. Similarly, the red areas merge with the yellow in son1e places and abruptly in others. Such tests as have been 1nade indicate that the dull olive-green areas are intimate mixtures of chert and jarosite that are not resolved into grains by the highest power of the n1icroscope. The yellow areas are probably plumbic jarosite or plu1nbojarosite resulting fro~ the addition of lead to the jarosite. In the midst of olive-green and· yellow areas there are coarsely crystalline patches of quartz, in which occur a few crystals of the sulphate n1inerals. (See pl. 26.) The inference seems clear that silica and the sulphate minerals were first deposited in intin1ate mixture and that later they segregated as coarsely crystalline grains and crystals. The red n1aterial is hydrous oxide of iron. derived ·fron1 jarosite or plun1bojarosite. All these n1aterials are interpreted as the products of weathering.
IRONSIDE MINE
The Ironside group (No. 27, pl. 30) lies in theW. 72
sec. 26, T. 24 S., R. 57 E., in the low ridges north of Shenandoah Gulch. The Ironside clain1 was first located in 1892 but has been abandoned and relocated under a different name four times since. Most of

114

GEOLOGY AND ORE DEPOSITS OF GOODSPRINGS QUADRANGLE, NEVADA

the present workings· were made during 1916 and

191 7. According to local rep-ort no ore has been

shipped from the property.

·

The workings explore a fracture zone near the base

of the dolomitized Valentine limestone, which here

trends north and is nearly vertical. The beds form

the east side of a sharp anticline that ends southward

against the Ironside fault. The fault is· shown by a

zone of crushed dolomite 100 feet or more broad,

which trends N. 45° E. and dips 60° NW. Some of

the fractures in the Ironside mine are parallel to the

walls of the fault and evidently were formed at the

sa1ne time.

The workings include a tunnel 110 feet long, at the

end of which there is an inclined shaft. There are

three levels, 50, 80, and 135 feet below the tunnel,

but none is more than .60 feet long. At the head of

the shaft there is an irregular raise to the surface.

These explorations follow a shear zone at least 5 feet

wide that trends generally N. 40° E. and dips 60°

NW. Within this zone there are· numerous local

walls that strike N. 20° to 60° E. and dip 40° to 70°

NW. These walls limit lenses of cellular ferruginous

chert as much as 5 feet thick. On the outer borders

of these there are layers of malachite and azurite

fron1 1 to 3 inches thick that probably constituted

the material sought. Among the several similar depos-

its in this region the chert is much less abundant on

the lower levels than on that of the tunnel. Although

a close s·earch was made, no jarosite or cobalt oxide

was found.

BOSS MINE

History.-The history of the Boss mine (No. 28, pl. 30) is· separable into two periods: The first begins with the discovery of the lode and location of the Boss claim by Joseph Yount on January 1, 1886, and covers the 28 years during which it was intermittently worked as a source of copper and gold. During this period the three upper and lowest tunnels were run. About 1898 an option wa.s given to Emory Hershing, who, on the basis of this and an option on the Columbia mine, erected a mill to treat the ore near the town of Goodsprings. The mill was sold in 1902 to the Yellow Pine Mining Co., and· it formed the nucleus of the mill used by that company until it burned in 1924. According to S. E. Yount, about 200 tons of copper ore· was. mined at the Boss mine from 1898 to 1900. The , second period of the mine's history begins with·· the discovery of platinum in the ore by H. K. Riddall about March 1, 1914, and the coincident formation of the Boss Gold Mining Co. After a little· exploration an option on the mine was giveri in .September, 1914, to V.l. C. Price and associates, ·Of Los Angeles, for

$200,000, of which $50,000 was paid in cash. They organized the Platinum Gold Mining Co. and carried out extensive development but shipped no ore. When they failed to complete the purcha~e, the mine reverted to the owners in October, 1915, and they mined all of the ore in sight. Except for two brief periods of exploration and current assessment work, there has been no mining on the property since 1919.
At the time of the writer's examination in 1922 all the workings were accessible, but lthe stopes from which most of the ore had corne were filled with waste. In the preparation of this report the writer has conferred with S. E. Yount, 0. J. Fisk, and Frank Crampton, manager during 1915, and has had access to a comprehensive suite of specimens collected by Mr. Crampton, as well as assay maps showing the source and composition of about 600 samples.
Production.-The production of the Boss mine, assembled from reports submitted annually by the owners to the United States Geological Survey, is presented below. If to the 3,051 tons recorded here is added the estimated production prior to 1900, the total is about 3,500 tons, and the gross value of the output is about $210,000.

Geology.-T'he Boss ore body lay along a minor fault zone that separates coarse gray dolomitized lin1estone near the base of the Monte Cristo fonnation on the southeast fr01n thinner-bedded light and dark gray dolornites that probably are a part of the Valentine member of the Sultan lilnestone on the northwest. (See pl. 33, A.) This fault zone appears to merge northwaed with the Ironside fault, one that makes a right angle with the l{eystone thrust but is undoubtedly related to it in age.· The beds northwest of the Boss fn.ult strike northeast and dip gently

northwest, the dip increasing from 15° at the south end of the explored zone to 45° at the north end. The beds southeast of the fault trend northwest but dip 5° SW.. The dip of the fault is not constant but averages 70° NW., and the relations indicate that the beds that make up the hanging wall have moved upward and northeastward with reference to those on the footwall. (See :fig..23.) There is thus a structural analogy with the Kirby, Rose, Highline, Copperside, and other near-by deposits. The underground workings reveal many faults, and the relutions of most of them are obscure. Along the northeast part of the 200, 300, and 400 foot· levels most of the faUlts appear
FIGURE 23.-Geologic cross section through Doss mine along line X-X, Plate 32
to fonn a simple major system, but in the neq,r-by country rock well-defined walls are met whose relations to the major faults are obscure. Most of these walls trend northeast and dip steeply northwest. Striae are common on the walls of the faults and largely range fron1 horizontal to 20° NE. Therefore they do not confirm the interpretation of the movement on the basis of the beds on the two walls. In addition to the northeastwal'd-trending faults, to which the ore · shoot appears to be related, two cross faults which limit a V-shaped block are shown on the 100 and 300 foot levels. (See pl. 32.) Several observers agree _that the block which is limited by these faults was dropped several feet below near-by parts of the ore shoot 'It may probably be· regarded as postInineral and preoxidation.
No igneous rocks are known underground or on the surfil.ce near by. A sill of granite porphyry was encountered in the workings of the Boss Extension Mining Co. 1,500 feet'to the northeast.

GEOLOGY AND ORE DEPOSITS OF GOODSPRINGS QUADRANGLE, NEVADA

Ore deposit.4L-All the ore shipped from the Boss mine was derived from a single rather simple continuous shoot, although other smaller bodies that yielded good assays were found and explored also. This shoot lay largely on the northwest or hanging-wall side of the main fault zone and formed a rudely elliptical pipe, which cropped out above the mouth of the 100-foot level and pitched about 10° NE. to the entrance of crosscut 209, where it terminated. (See pl. 32.) In few places it was more tha,n 25 feet in diameter, and the length was about 200 feet. Smaller bodies that had the form of irregular lenses were encountered in crosscuts 307 and 313 and crosscut and winze 312, and although they had a general trend northeast, they cut across the bedding in. strike and dip. Although a

Although the principal shoot is practically mined out and filled with waste, several persons who examined it repeatedly soon after it was explored state that the larger relations of the minerals were the same as tho.se which may. still be seen in the smaller shoots, such as are shown along crosscut 307. The most abundant material in most of the shoots, large and small, is ·quartz, which occurs largely in the form of a white powder but in part as a dark coherent cellular mass. (See fig. 24, zone 4.) The powder is made up of myriads of nearly perfect doubly terminated clear crystals, 0.1 to 0.2 millimeter in diameter.

Reduced to ounces a ton, the analysis shows gold to be present to the extent of 234 ounces, platinum 15 ounces, and palladium 64 ounces. Assays of similar material are reported to show as high u.s 575 ounces of gold, 230 ounces of platinum, and 30 ounces of palladium. The silica and titania shown by the analysis represent an admixture of quartz and octahedrite.
The gold and platinum metals can be partly separated from the plumbojarosite by panning, but long before a clean separation can be effected fine gold and especially platinum pass into the tailings, in spite of the utmost precaution. The gold is extraordinarily rough and spongy; delicate platy forms are.

It is more or less blackish, and aggregates of the finer particles look like so much black sand. Treatment with hydrochloric acid and annealing, however, bring out the normal yellow color of gold. Some of the larger particles after being treated thus were analyzed by R. C. Wells, as follows:

Qualitative tests on other gold particles always showed the absence of platinum metals, and the inference of Ledoux & Co. that the metals are present "apparently as alloys of gold and platinum metals" is therefore not borne out. The platinum and palladium occur in extremely small particles, which even at high magnification under a binocular microscope are indistinguishable from the dull blackish particles of gold; in all material examined by the writer chemical tests were necessary to establish the presence of the platinum and allied metals. By cleaning ~he precious metals in molten sodium carbonate, ·particles of gray metal (platinum and palladium, or an alloy of these) become distinguishable· from yellow gold. The possibility was entertained that sperrylite might be present in the residue of the pannings from the plumbojarosite or elsewhere in the ores of the Boss mine, but no trace of this mineral, which, according to its discoverer, is characterized by a wonderfully brilliant luster, was found.
This material has been reexa1nined recently by W: T. Schaller, who reports that it may be regarded as a n1ixture of plumbojarosite, beaverite, bis1nutite, and quartz in the P!3rcentages 67 .3, 17.2, 6.9, 6.9. The presence of beayerite has already been established by Knopf. The recognition of bisrnutite is based upon

118

GEOLOGY AND ORE DEPOSITS OF GOODSPRINGS QUADRANGLE, NEVAPA

the fact that dilute nitric acid causes effervescence, and the filtrate contains muc.h bismuth. Plumbojarosite and beaverite are insoluble in dilute nitric acid. If, after deducting the beaverite, bisnlutite, quartz, and the noble metals, the molecular proportions of the remaining radicles are calculated, they are found to be (PbO, K20, N a:?.O) : Fe20a: · S03 : H20 = 0.99 : 2.89 : 4.05: 6.08. These may be expressed 1 X 0.99: 3 X 0.95: 4 X 1.01 : 6 X 1.01 and are very close to the ratios of plumbojarosite, 1: 3: 3: 6.
It is possible that part of the noble metals are present as components of a mineral of the jarositic group or else that the portions of them present in the metallic state have been derived from the decomposition of such a jarosite, isomorphous with plumbojarosite.
According to F. R. Crampton/7 some of the masses of plumbojarosite were stratified as if laid down in water; others formed narrow veins in diverse attitudes. The inner mass of quartz was surrounded by a persistent but not uniform layer of coherent brownlimonite, locally siliceous, which contained spotadic masses of yellow jarosite.· (See fig. 24, zone 3.) This material contained small quantities· of copper but little gold, platinum, and palladium. It was not sharply sepa~ rable fr01n the inner quartzose core nor the outer zone, which was largely dolomite impregnated with copper carbonate, although here and there chrysocolla filled fractures or covered druses. The copper-bearing minerals and impregnated dolomite contained only traces of gold and platinum.
Chrysocolla is a common mineral in the Boss workings. It forms mamn1illary crusts on veinlets and in open spaces and appears to have resulted fron1 the addition of silica in solution to the previously existing copper minerals, generally 1nalachite. Loosely coherent masses of the basic copper phosphate, libethenite, . were found on the dump. Sulphide minerals were found at several places in the workings, but the total quantity was small, and the relations with the dark .quartz are obscure. In ·the northeastern part of the intermediate level, not shown on Plate 32, angular masses of copper miner~ls were found in which chalcopyrite, bornite, and chalcocite formed nuclei in the oxidized minerals, n1alachite and cuprite.·
Evon though present exposures of the ore shoot are meager, it seems clear that the unoxidized shoot was a pipelike mass of cellular quartz impregnated with chalcopyrite and possibly pyrite and that these minerals contained uncommon amounts of gold, platinmn, and ·palladium. The white quartz powder contains little of these metals, but the presence of octahedrite in 'it indicates that it was formed at higher temperatures than those which have prevailed since weathering began. The present distribution of iron and copper minerals in the shoots is doubtless due to migration during w athering. It is such as would be expected
H Personal communication.

if the deposit were repeatedly wetted and dried and opportunity therefore offered for repeated solution and deposition of iron and copper salts. The nearly perfect segregation of copper minerals from the iron oxide zone indicates that in· a zone permeated. by carbonate waters copper is more soluble than iron.
From what is recorded cqncerning the distribution and grade of the platinum-bearing plumbojarosite it seems certain that both platinum and palladium have migrated locally from the position at which they were originally deposited. The n1eager content ·of platinun1 and palladium in the _oxidized iron and copper minerals from all parts of the mine, however, indicates that those metals were much less soluble under the local conditions than iron and copper. Although no assays of unweathered sulphide. minerals for platinum and palladium have been made, it seems certain that the platiniferous plumboj arosite contains n1ore of these
ametals per ton of material and that enrichment has
taken place during the we thering. The explorations that have been made appear to
show adequately that the ore shoot of the Boss n1ine does not persist directly down the dip of the fault zone. If the position of the shoot is determined, as the writer believes, by the intersection of the fault zone and a certain stratum in the hanging wall of the zone,· any extension of the shoot should be sought northeast of the present workings, in th~ general direction of the pitch of the principal shoot.
PLATINA MINE
The Platina Mines Corporation owns two clai1ns in
the NE. X sec. 34, T. 24 S., R. 57 E. (No. 29, pl.
30). The workings include two tunnels .on the north side of a promin-ent spur south of the Boss mine and five short tunnels on the south side of the ridge . These workings explore beds of dolomitized Dawn limestone, which here trend northwest and dip 25° SW. It is locally reported that one car of copper ore was shipped from the property during the period of activity of the Boss mine, 1916-HH8.
The lower tunnel with drifts is about 345 feet long but appears to have shown the presence of but little copper. In the upper tunnel, only 95 feet long, there is a stope about 15 by 35 feet, parallel to the bedding and 3 feeli high. The material on the dump indicates that this stope yielded lenses of ferruginous chert around the border of which there were layers of malachite and chrysocolla. Some sa111ples of material from this tunnel are said to have shown the presence of platinum, but this has not been confirmed.
Of the five tunnels south of the ridge the longest is about 100 feet and the dumps show little copper.

26, T. 24 S., R. 57 E. The Azurite clain1 was located

in 1899 by W. H. Smith and C. W. Cook, and most of

the other claims prior to 1903. The first work was

done by the Nevada Mining & Smelting Co., which is

reported to have shippe9 two cars· of copper ore prior

to 1902. The Nevada Copper Co. was organized in

1902 and, although it did considerable work, shipped

only one ca.r of ore before the Azurite Mining Co. was

organized in 1911. .Most of the present work was

done by lessees during 1916 and 1917, and they

shipped 1nost of the ore.

Of the production shown in· the following table, all

but 56 tons of the copper ore was shipped from work-

ings on the Azurite claim; 56 tons was taken from

shallow workings on the Sandy claim; the lead and

zinc ore came fron1 the upper tunnel on the Rosella

claim.

The workings on the Azurite claim include a main tunnel 260 feet long that trends generally southwest from a point 250 feet above the floor of Shenandoah Gulch. (See fig. 25.) The ore from this claim came fron1 two blind levels, 12 and 35 feet higher. On the Gulch claim, below the Azurite, there is a shaft ·inclined at 30° for 50 feet, then vertical for 120 feet, but this is not· accessible. On the Rosella claim there is a lower tunnel 390 feet long, which developed no ore, and an upper tunnel 200 feet ·higher and 50 feet long, at the end of which there is a 40-foot inclined shaft. This claim yielded all the lead and zinc ore that has been shipped.
The Azurite main tunnel explores a zone at the base of the Anchor limestone, which is extensively dolomitized here. The Rosella tunnels are in beds near the top of the Bullion dolomite. In this area the beds strike northwest and dip 15° to 20° SW. The only igneous rock on the claims is a dike of basaltic rock 3 to 8 inches thick, which is struck in the lower Rosella tunnel and followed 35 feet. It trends N. 54° W. and .dips 80° SW. It is probably similar to the dike west of the Kirby mine, the age of which is considered as late Tertiary.
The sources of copper ore in the Azurite tunnel were three shoots, one of which cropped out at the surface. The largest shoot was explored above and below the upper level and the smallest was explored from a winze below the intermediate level. No relation between these separate shoots was recognized. ·The

The total shipments from the mine are not recorded. One .car containing 9.84 tons shipped by a lessee in 1918 contained gold, 0.01 ounce to the ton; silver, 1 ounce to the ton~ copper, 14.54 per cent; iron, 13 per cent; and insoluble 1natter, 31.6 per cent.
On the south side of the ridge covered by the Rose claim, probably on the Black Jack· cla~~' there are two groups of explorations. The northern and higher group includes an inclined shaft about 60 feet deep, which follows a wall that trends N. 70° W. and dips 40° to 50° NE., and a lower tunnel, 385 feet long, that trends northwest. The shaft explored an iron-stained breccia zone that lies under the wall and appears to have contained lenses of cherty lead carbonate. In son1e specimens the carbonate is outwardly altered to yellow plumboja.rosite. Many small lumps of pure pyromorphite were found on the dump, and pyromorphite nppen.rs to have been common in the product shipped. The lower tunnel encountered no ore shoots, and there is no stoping.
About 1,000 feet farther ~outh on the west side of n ravine there is a vertical shaft about 175 feet deep, untimbered a.nd therefore inaccessible. It follows a wall that trends N. 10° E. and dips 85° W., along which there is a zone of iron-stained breccia· 3 feet wide. Here and there the breccia is splashed with malachite.
Both the ravine north of the Rose tunnel and that on the Black Jack claim, which drains s~uthward, yielded angular fragn1ents of hard cherty lead c~r­ bonate. The total quantity collected and shipped is locnlly reported to exceed 200 tons, which contained more than 50 per cent of lead. Similar fragments were readily collected from near-by deposits, but it is interesting that a much greater quantity was· found in the western part of the ravine than was mined from ~ear-by prospects.

R. 58 E. (No. 43, pl. 30). The Josephine claim was located in 1883, but nwst of the work is on the Columbin claim, which was located in ·1886.· According to local r13port, a prospector, Von Trigger, had located the

ground'- and mined 10 tons of copper ore as ·early as 1880. F.rom 1898 to 1903, when the Columbia and Boss mines were optioned to Emory Hershing and associates, there was some exploration and a mill Wfl.S btiilt on the present site of the Yellow Pine mill. This was the first mill erected in the district. In 1906 the property was bought for $20,000 by Joseph Dederich, who still owns it.
There is no accurate record of production prior to 1902, but that since 1906 is shown in the accompanying table. Probably the total production is slightly less than 3,000 tons of copper ore.

GEOLOGY AND ORE DEPOSITS OF GOODSPRINGS QUADRANGLE, NEVADA

Both shafts explore zones near the middle of the Sultan limestone and the beds are completely dolomitized. Near the western w9rkings the beds strike east and dip 30° S., but they turn gradually toward the north-
east, so that at the eastern shaft they strike N 55° E.
and dip 25° SE. Farther east they trend east again and then southeast.
In the eastern workings an area about 70 by 90 feet has been irregularly stoped to a maximum height of 20 feet. Above the upper level the ore a11 lay above a sill of granite porphyry 2 to 3 feet thick, which is nearly parallel with the bedding and is much sheared and decomposed. The.sill was not found on the lower level, but there is a persistent wall which cuts the bedding. If the ore body were projected downward it would lie above this wall. From the data that can now be obtained the ore minerals appear to have been deposited in a breccia zone roughly parallel to the bedding abo.ve both the wall and the sill. Only traces of copper. minerals were found in the workings, but specimens from the . dump show dolomite breccia
I.
cemented by iron and copper oxides in which there are ·sporadic traces of chalcopyrite and chalcocite. In some specimens there are lenticular masses made up of tenorite and iron oxide in which there are sporadic grains of chalcocite. The tenorite forms plumose aggregates, and the borders adjacent to the dolomite are vague and irregular.
Probably chalcopyrite alone was the original sulphide mineral. The absence of quartz and other gangue minerals is conspicuous. Where the dolomite is close to chalcopyrite or the oxides resulting from its weathering, it is locally stained green, evidently by malachite. Azurite is very rare, but chrysocolla and dioptase occur. on fractures and in druses. The final coatings on such druses are chalcedony and quartz, · then calcite. The average grade of the ore that was shipped indicates that large masses of pure copper minerals, such as chalcocite, chalcopyrite, and malachite, were rare; probably much of the ore resembled that now foul}d on the dump.
A black oxide of cobait sporadically replaces the dolomite near the copper minerals but is much less abundant than in the workings of the western shaft.
Near the bottom of the western shaft and east of it there is a stope about 30 by .50 feet in area and largely 5 to 7 feet wide. This stope underlies a well-defined wall whose strike nearly coincides with the bedding and whose dip is 3° to 5° steeper. There is 1 to 12 inc}fes of gouge under this wall and above the shoot. The ore contained the same minerals as that from the eastern shaft.
There is a well-defined fault west of the shaft that strikes N. 10° E. and dips 80° W., and on either side of it the dolomite country rock is sporadically replaced by cobalt oxide. (See pl. 27, B ..) The cobalt oxide forms dendrites along fractures, much like manganese

oxides in many regions. The black dolon1ite does not contain more than 6 per cent of cobalt; however, but locally there are richer veinlike lenses. During 1921. Frank Miller, of Goodsprings,n1ined and shipped three lots of cobalt ore. having the weights and cobalt content. indicated below:
· Lot 1. 4,826 pounds; 5.13 per cent of cobalt. Lot 2. 3,799 pounds; 13.42 per cent of cobalt. Lot 3. 549 pounds; 2.9.18 per cent of cobalt.
To. judge from t.he local associations of the cobalt and the inforn1ation gained elsewhere in the district, the cobalt was present as sulphide or arsenide along the fault referred to and migrated into the near-by dolomite during weathering.
MINOR PROSPECTS EAST OF COLUMBIA MINE
Anwng the rnany prospect pits in the S. ~ sees. 27 and 28, T. 24· S., R. 58 E., only one. deserves mention, probably on the Kentuckian claim, where an inclined shaft 35 feet deep to a level 65 feet long explores a shear zone 45 feet wide that trends N. 15° E. and dips 55° NW. in dark dolomite of the Goodsprings fornlation. The zone contains lenses of ferruginous chert along the fractures of which there are coatings of malachite, chrysocolla, and a greenish vanadate, probably cuprodescloizite.
LINCOLN MINE
The Lincoln mine (No. 55, pl. 30) is on a low ridge adjacent to the wash of lvanpah Valley, in the
NE. X sec. 13, T. 25 S., R. 58 E. Five of the seven
claims were located by E. W. Lincoln and others in 1905. The total production is probably greater than the summary presented herewith but does not exceed 60 tons of ore. Most of the ore shipped has contained about 12 per cent of copper and 15 ounces of silver to the ton, but one lot of 2,700 pounds, shipped by J. A. Egger in 1917, contained 97 ounces of silver to the ton.
The principal working is an inclined shaft 350 feet long, which begins with a slope of 16° but attains a
maximum of 35° near the end. (See fig. 27.) The
workings explore a zone of pale-gray dolomite about 800 feet below the top of the Goodsprings formation, which locally trends northeast and dips 10° NW. In the lower 100 feet of the shaft there is a well-defined wall that trends N. 15° to 25° W. and dips 80° SW. Near this wall there are lenses and rounded masses of ferruginous silica, in and around which there are veinlets and small masses of chrysocolla, the largest 3 by 4 by 4 feet. Other copper minerals may have been present, but chrysocolla is the most abundant of those remaining. Specimens of iron-bearing chert given to the writer by Mr. Egger show thin films of silver chloride and bromide on fractures. Ore was found at several places, but the largest stope, near the central part of the shaft, is 25 by 25 by 12 feet. The general

POTOSI MINE
Location and history.-Tbe Potosi mine (No. 1,_pl. 30) is high on the west slope of a. prominent ridge that extends southwestward from Potosi Mountain. It is 11 miles northwest of Goodsprings and 21 miles southwest of Arden, the nearest railroad point. The cn.mp, which is at Potosi Springs, half .a mile north of the nrine and 700 feet below it, is connected with it by aerial trannvay and narrow-gage track.
There seems to be little doubt that the deposit was t.he first to be explored in the district and possibly was the first source of lea.d in Nevada.. The early

history is given on pages 69-70. According to Owen,49 it was the cause of local excite1nent in 1861. It was examined by C. A. Luckhardt in 1870,60 when it was known as the Comet and owned by the Silver State Mining· Co. Luckhardt wrote:
Work was commenced by a cut at the bluff on the western slope of the mountain, which exposed the vein for 30 feet in width and 40 feet in length, presenting a mass of ore and country rock, the former predominating by far. An incline of 40 feet traverses the vein diagonally below this cut; and here horizontal drifts, 70 feet long, have been run on the vein. The lower workings s)low the metal (galena) to exist in seams and bunches, varying from 4 to 9 feet in width, of solid compact ore, separated by barren bunches of gangue. These bunches and seams of ore at the surface are as likely to yield 5 as 500 tons of ore; there is no regularity observable in their
occurrence. · * * * A sample of ore, regardless of waste,
from ore seams 6 inches to 11 feet in width, taken along the vein for 336 feet in length, gave 31 per cent lead and $39.06 (about 30 ounces) silver per ton, and -no gold.
The mine was examined and briefly described by G. K. Gilbert, geologist attached to the Wheeler expedition in 1871.61
Except for the meager record that it was worked as a local source of lead from time to time, little more is recorded until 1904, when it became the property of the Potosi Zinc & Lead Co., of which the Mahoney brothers, of San Francisco, were the principal owners. According to A. J. Robbins, who first saw the mine in 1892, there were at that time a small hearth and piles of cordwood near the foot of the present aerial tramway. The completion of the railroad from Salt Lake City to Los Angeles in 1905 permitted the shipment of the ores, and it produced steadily until 1920. It was examined by Bain 62 late in' 1905, and he was impressed by elements of similarity between this. deposit and those in the Mississippi Valley,.which appear not to be related to igneous rocks. Late in 1913 it was purchased by the Empire Zinc Co. for a price reported to have been $125,000, and in 1926 this company sold it to the International Smelting Co. Although the Empll:e Zinc Co. shipped more than half the output, a review of the old maps indicates that it accomplished this largely by efficient methods of nll.ning in ground known to be ore bearing rather than by greatly extending explorations or by discovery of new shoots.
Production.-There is no record of the early production of lead ore from the Potosi mine. It certainly amounted to s~veral hundred tons, but as little, if any, found its way out of the region unsn1elted, it was probably less than 1,000 tons. Since 1905, when .the railroad reached Arden, lead ore has been

shaly Arrowhead lin1estone, 12 feet thick, which crops out and is encountered in many places underground. In a broad way the beds trend east and dip gently south. For several hundred feet north of the main tunnel the Arrowhead limestone is flexed sharply downward, and as the beds 500 feet or n10re farther west along the track to the tramway are vertical or dip west, it is easy to get the iinp,ression that they are stratigraphically higher than the ore-bearing limestone and that the mine lies near the crest of an anticline. When the local areal relations are examined closely, however, it is clear that the beds west of the n1ine are stratigraphically lower than the ore-bearing lin1estone, that they are upturned under the Keystone thrust farther west, and that a normal fault, which drops the west side 40 feet, passes a ·few feet west of the mouth of the tunnel. It is this fault, which trends N. 30° W. and dips steeply west, that produces the sharp flexure in the Arrowhead limestone. A similar fault crops·

Geology.-The Potosi deposit lies in the massive Yellowpine limestone, and its stratigraphic position, therefore; is exactly the. same as that of the Yellow Pine deposit, but the structural relations are entirely different. Inasmuch as Gilbert and others have been misled by the local structure, doubtless because of inadequate time for study of the near-by region, a sketch is presented that sets forth the writer's interpretation. (See fig. 28;) The ore-bearing limestone, 80 feet thick and dolomitized near the ore body, crops out .as a vertical cliff (pl. 33, B) and is underlain by the

out along the cliff 500 feet north of the tunnels. The displacement of both faults increases toward the southeast.
The underground workings reveal con1plicated structural conditions. (See pl. 34.) This examination indicates the outstanding structural relations of the ore deposit, but more comprehensive and detailed study would doubtless throw further light on it. The structure of the beds that inclose the ore body is shown by exposures of the shaly Arrowhead limestone as well as sporadic partings in the overlying bed. In detail the beds form a shallow syncline, the axis of which lies in the western part of the mine and pitches south. This axis clearly lies west of the principal ore-bearing ground. The faults in the mine are separable into two groups, both of which appear to have played an important part in the localization of ore, as they appear to be premineral. If any post1nineral faults are present in the Potosi ni.ine they have not been recognized.
The most persistent fault is that which forn1s the hanging wall of the deposit. . It has been explored on

From the present distribution of the bodies of hydrozincite and those of blende it seems that the oxidi~ing

DAWN MINE

. The Dawn mine (No.4, pl. 30) is 9 miles northwest of Goodsprings, between the Contact and Ninety-nine
mmines. The claim was located by A. Munzebrook 1910, .and although a little work 'vas done in the next few years, most of the shipments were made by the Dawn Mining Co. in 1918. The_ principal exploration is an inclined· shaft, which extends southwest into a ridge for a distance of 200 feet. The workings explore a crushed zone in .the upper part of the Bullion dolomite. The beds trend N. 20° W. and dip 60° NE., and the breccia zone trends N. 40° to 50° E. and dips 45° SE. About 100 feet north of the mouth of the shaft there is an extensive northwestward-trending normal fault, one of those parallel to the Ninety-nine fault. .. The principal mineral encountered was light-colored hydrozincite, but some calamine, together with galena and its oxidation products, was generally present. One prospect 50 feet southeast of the shaft yielded an intiinate mixture of siliceous limonite and wulfenite. The shipments were derived from two stopes, both of which were limited on one side by good walls ~hat trend N. 40° E. and dip 45° SE.; the larger was 25 feet long, 30 feet high, and 1 to 4 feet wide. Doubtless the primary ore lay along fractures that cut obliquely across the bedding.

PAULINE MINE
The Pauline mine (No. 5, pl. 30) lies half a mile northeast of the Contact mine, on the west edge of sec. 22, T. 23 S., R. 58 E. About 250 feet of work has been ··done, but most of it is in a tunnel that extends generally northwest. The tunnel is driven in.dolomitized Yellowpine limestone at the top of the Monte Cristo formation, about 75 feet above the Contact thrust, ,along which the beds are thrust upon the .Aztec sandstone. Some ore has been stoped above the tunnel

along· a zone that trends N. 40° W. and lies parallel to an extensive normal fault 75 feet ·to the southwest. This relation fortifies the impression obtained elsewhere that the Ninety-nine and other near-by faults are premineral.
Although there is no record of shipments, some material has doubtless been shipped. The dump contains a number of lead, zinc, and copper ~erals, but probably the most abundant is cuprodescloizite, which forms mammillary crusts around rock fragments.
The Aztec claim, which ·has been explored by a sb.allow shaft near the trail to the Contact mine, likewise yielded many specimens of an olive-green vanadate.
CONTACT MINE
The Cqntact mine (No. 6, pl. 30) is the southernmost of the group of mines that lies north of Goodsprings on the east slope of the mountains. It is about 8 miles north of the town. It was located by A. L. Chaffin in 1906, but little work was done until 1915, when the Goodsprings Contact Mining Co. was formed~ Most of the work was done during 1916 and 1917, but none has been done since 1919.
The Contact mine explores a deposit in the Bullion dolomite near the base of a large block of Monte Cristo and Bird Spring limestones, which are thrust e~stward along the Contact fault upoi;J. the red Aztec sandstone. The fault is clearly shown along the hill northeast of the mine, where it has been explored by several prospects; it trends about N. 10° E. and dips
15° W. The beds form part of' a broad southwa.rd-
pitching anticline, which has been traced a mile south and 6 miles north, but it is much broken by later faults. At the mine the beds strike S. 65° W. and dip 50,0 to 70° SE. At. the collar of the Contact shaft the Contact thrust fault lies about 250 feet vertically below the surface. The workings explore a zone about 150 feet stratigraphically below the basal sandstone of the Bird Spring formation, which is exposed on the ridge ·southwest of the mine.
There are two principal workings-a tunnel that extends about 160 feet southwest and a shaft on an incline of about 40° several hundred feet west of the tunnel. · The tunnel explored a zone parallel to the local bedding. From the shaft there are drifts northeast at 90 feet below the top and at the bottom, possibly 300 feet in all. Ore was stoped west' of the shaft from a roughly triangular area, 40 by 50 feet and as much as 6 feet thick in places. This ore occurred in dolomite breccia recemented by reddish dolomite in a zone parallel to the local bedding, trending approxiinately N. 70° W. and dipping 40° SW. To judge from what may be seen now, the ore was largely earthy hydrozincite and calamine, locally associated with galena and oxidized lead minerals. Cuprodescloizite and aurichalcite are found here and there.

PILGRIM MINE
The Pilgri1n claim (No. 9, pl. 30) was first located in 1892 by A. G. Campbell, but little work was done until 1908, when it was acquired by Harvey Hardy and associates. The present group of seven claj.ms is owned by the Pilgrim Mining Co. They are about 5 miles northwest of Goodsprings.

ofstope was largely gray crystals of carbonate lead

that passed a half-inch screen and contained ·15 to 25

per cent of lead and 15 to 25 ounces of silver to the ton.

Lenses of earthy hydrozincite are more abundant in

the lower'levels, and that from the face of the 90.-foot

level has a pale lavender color. Calamine is wide-

spread, and wulfenite is found here and there. ·

The largest stope lies above the 60-foot level south

of the shaft, extends irregularly over an ·area 40 by

50 feet, and is 1 to 4 feet high. Its roof is a wall that

extends N. 55° W. and dips 25° SW. and probably

coincides with the bedding. At the north end of the

90-foot level a stope lies below a curved wall that

trends east of north and dips at low angles to the west; ~

probably this ·wall also coincides with the bedding

but is at a lower stratigraphic position than the upper

stope.

Although there are minor faults that cut across the

beds, most of the ore lay along folds in. the bedding

planes, some of which are very irregular in detail.

One breccia zone, locally cavernous, extends north-

ward from the stope above the 60-foot level south of

the shaft to the stope at the face of the 90-foot level

north. The sporadic distribution of ore minerals is

clearly due to the complicated structure of the beds

where they overlie the Potosi thrust fault.

At a. shallow shaft several hundred feet northeast

of the marin Pilgrim shaft there is a vein or bedded

lens of nearly pure pyromorphite, in places as rnuch as

8 inches wide. The strike of the lens is west and the

dip south, but it ended abruptly westward against a

The country rock is dolomitized thin-bedded limestone in the lower part of the Bird Spring formation, but the 40-foot level south struck sandstone, probably a bed that lies near the base of the formation. In a broad way the beds strike northwest and dip gently southwest. They are considerably folded locally, however, and cut by numerous curved joints; these conditions are not surprising, as the Potosi thrust lies only a few hundred feet to the east, slightly buried under the wash. If the Red Cloud dike extends much farther northwest than the surface exposures, it lies 800 feet west of the Pilgrim shaft.
Lead minerals were more abundant in the mine than those of zinc. Although galena is common in the lower workings· as coarse crystals in cavernous dolomite breccia, it is less abundant than cerusite above the 60-foot level. The n1aterial shipped from the upper

PRAIRIE FLOWER MINE

The Prairie Flower claiin (No. 11, pl. 30) is 4 miles northwest of Goodsprings and half a mile northeast of the Yellow Pine mine. It was located in 1901, but little work was done before 1908, when, with the Solio claim, it was sold to S. E. Yount and W. E. Allen for $6,000. They began work and, after striking lead ore within a few weeks, sold it to Jesse Knight and Alonzo D. Hyde for $12,000. The Prairie Flower Mining Co. was formed, and the ore body was explored to a depth of 110 feet from the old shaft. During 1909 and 1910 the company produced 10 carloads of high-

grade lead ore and about 30 carloads of oxidized zinc ore, 1,314 tons in all. From September, 1911, to 1913 it was leased to G. Meacham, R. Duncan, and J. A. Fredrickson, who sank the shaft to its present depth-300 feet-a.nd n1ined 203 tons of lead and zinc ore. In 1917, under lease to the Prairie Flower Leasing Co., the new or Hale shaft, several hundred feet south of the old shaft, was sunk to 200 feet aJ).d drifts run north and south. In 1923 this shaft was sunk to 400 feet, and crosscuts were run east and west. Early in 1927 the 400-foot level east was connected by a raise with the old Prairie Flower sha.ft. · At the present time· the company is controlled by the Yellow ; Pine Mining Co.

F~r a short distance north and east of the old shaft the limestones near the ore are sporadically altered

The rocks exposed at the surface near the Prairie Flower shaft include the Yellowpinc limestone and the Yellow Pine sill of granite porphyry. The Arrowhead limestone does not cro·p out on the surface but has been repeatedly stnick undergro.und. The sandstone at the base of the Bird Spring formation is present in the workings near the north winze of the Yellow Pine mine (fig. 30), but in several places fa.rther north .it is represented by nearly black sheared shale, locally 2 to 5 feet instead of 23 to 28 feet thick. At the botton1 of the Solio shaft, 750 feet north of the old Prairie Flower shaft, the horizon of the sandstone is represented by a bed of chert cobblestones in dark clay. The beds trend N. 30° to 45° E. and dip 45° to 60° NW. As explorations are confined to two levels, it is not. possible to make a structure contour rnap of the entire area, but portions of the explored ground are included in the map of the Yellow Pine mine forming Plate 36, B.
The Yellow Pine sill is struck on the 200-foot level from the new shaft but dips more steeply than the local bedding. There is a possibility that it follows a preintrusive thrust fault slightly steeper than the bedding, but it more probably follows the general zone of unconformity at the base of the Bird Spring formation.
On the 900-foot level north of the new shaft the drift passes through two blocks of porphyry that are probably fault.ed parts of the sill but may be small dikes.

Production.-The production of the Yellow Pine Mining Co. is recorded in the two accompanying tables. The first records the annual statements sub·mitted to the United States Geological Survey by the company and shows t.he content of reeoverable metals. The seeond has been assembled by the company and shows the classification of the material shipped as well as the total receipts, costs, and profits.
A review of the average content of the products shipped each year shows that the crude lead ore has contained 47 to 63 per cent of lead, 5 to 13 per cent of zinc, and 17 to 22 ounces .of silver to the ton. The lead concentrate has contained 51 to 56 per cent of lead., 12.5 to 14.5 per cent of zinc, and 25 to 50 ounces of silver to the ton. As in other mines in the district where the crude ore has been milled to yield a lead concentrate, the silver content of the concentrate is two or more times that in the crude ore per unit of lead. The mixed lead-zinc ore has contained 13 to 16 per cent of lead, 27 to 30 per cent of zinc, and about 11 ounces of silver to the ton. The crude zinc ore has contained 34 to 45 per cent of zinc, 3.5 to 6.5 per cent of lead, and 1 to 6 ounces of silver to the ton. The zinc concentrate has contained 32 to 34.5 per cent of zinc, 4 to 6.5 per cent of lead, and 2.5 to 6 ounces of silver to the ton. The zinc slime has contained 32

to 35 per cent of zinc, 6.5 to 8 per cent of lead, and 3.5

to 6 ounces of silver to the ton. The insoluble n1atter,

probably in large part silica, is eon1monly under 5

per cent, but· some shipn1ents of crude lead ore contain

as much as 15 per cent.

As shown in Plate 36, B, the strike of the beds shifts by slight changes from N. '20° E. at the south end of the mine to N. 45° E. at the north end. The dip is 39° in a block at the south end~ but, beginning at a fault (A, pl. 36, B), it increases gradually from 32° to 39° near the crushed zone at the middle and to 48° at the north end, and in the Prairie Flower ground it is as much as 60°. In detail most of the blocks for which the data are good, especially in the southern part of the nlln.e, appear to be limited by simple curved surfaces rather than planes; this is shown by the converging instead of parallel contours.

Jf, as here~ they are drawn on a bed a;nd on faults that

In other words, where a contour on a bed is offset by a contour on a fault (pl. 36, B), it should be clearly understood that the offset is not necessarily the horizontal component (strike slip) of the fault.

above. Sin1ilar but smaller stopes in which one wall coincides with a fault are found rather widely.
In many parts of the mine, particularly south of the Hale shaft, the· stopes are limited upward by smooth walls and although in places these walls seem to coincide with local bedding, elsewhere they appreciably depart from bedding in strike as well as dip. Thus, the hanging wall over the stope above the 600foot .level ranges ,from 10 to 35 feet stratigraphically below the overlying sandstone. , In the same area the dip of the wall is 36°, .although that of the inclosing beds is 32°. (See fig. 32, A.) In the northern part of the mine some' stopes extend up to the overlying sandstone, ·whereas others near by are 30 feet lower. This discordance of dip between bedding planes and hanging walls of ore bodies, taken with brecciation of the dolomite on the lateral walls of the stopes, forms the ·basis for the conclusion that the sulphide ore bodies i.n the mine were deposited in a fault breccia rather than along bedding planes, as in many other districts.
·,In sev;«3ral parts of the mine there are superposed stopes.. ···These are well shown on the 200-foot level south of the old shaft (cross section b-b, fig. 32, ·B), . on the 500-foot level near th~ Hale shaft, and between the 900 and 1,100 foot levels, adjacent to the north w.inze. In each of these areas the lateral waJls of th,e S·topes ·show brecciation of the inclosing dolomite.
At a number of places in the mine, particularly ·on the lower levels in the northern part, under the large stopes on hydrozincite ore, there are bodies of smithsonite along fractures. In part the smithsonite is unaltered and rich enough to be ·mined as ore, but in some places it cements dolomite breccia and is too low in grade. Elsewhere the. dolomite fragments have been ·dissolved and the remaining cavities partly or wholly :filled with white hydrozincite and .calan1ine. (See pl. 28, D.) Particular intmest is attached to such occurrences of smithsonite because they indicate the earlier presence of bodies of zinc minerals at higher levels. · Faults.-During the examination of the mine it was the; purpose to record the principal faults, although it was rea.dily seen that, within the time available, it would be quite impossible to record all fractures. M·ost of those recorded are shown on Plate 36, A. It was· also· the purpose to determine whether the faults were formed before the sulphide mineralization (premineral), and therefore might have played a .part in the Jocalization of sulphides, or whether they were formed after the sulphide mineralization (postmineral). The postmineral group might include faults along which movement was either earljer or later than the oxidation of the sulphides.
The facts that in many pJaces the strike and dip of the hanging wall of the or.e·body deviate from those of the local bedding and that the ore body coincides with

·a breccia zone indicate ·that the sulphide minerals were deposited along a fault fracture that must be related to the flat thrust faults of the region. If this is the case, it is a matter of some importance in the search for ore to determine whether the known ore bodies were localized on a single or several thrust faults and, as the ore bodies are not continuous in a given direction· without break, whether the offsets were formed before or· after mineralization. One may also speculate whether similar parallel flat thrust faults may not be found more deeply buried.
It will be profitable to review the present general distribution of ore shoots (stopes) in the light of the speculation whether their irregularities are most reasonably explained by postmineral or premineral faulting of a simple breccia zo:Q.e on a thrust fault, as local criteria are lacking or very obscure in many places. The possibility should also be considered whether there may have been renewed postmineral movement on premineral faults. The simplest concept of the YelJow Pine shoo.ts is that the sulphide minerals were deposited along a thrust fault in a simple pipe that plunged northward at an inclination of about 20° and that the shoot has since been broken by faults and weathered. This concept assumes that the solutions which deposited the sulphides had a source to the north and rose gently southward. But, as noted below, there can be no doubt that several cross faults were the sources of some mineralization, and it is necessary to consider an alternate concept that numerous premineral cross faults were channels of access of solutions to one or more breccia zones and that, although the breccia zones may have been continuous, they were broken before mineralization and local irregularities of form resulted fmm fortuitous differences in the cross faults. I P. considering irregularities of form of ore bodies, however, allowance must be made for the probable effect of migration of metals during weathering, and this is difficult to do with confidence.
The only trustworthy criterion that a fault in this region is premineral is the presence of unbroken grains of galena in the dolomite breccia along the fault. The oxidized minerals of both lead and zinc may always contain materials that have migrated appreciably from the site of the original sulphides and therefore can not be used for this purpose. If many faults were explored extensively outside of the ore zone, it might be possible to use the presence or absence of dolomitization as a criterion, for areal work has shown that, except near centers of recent volcanism, dolomitization took place before and during mineralization but not afterward.
When it is proved that one fault in a mine or region is premineral, and its relations to another of different strike or dip are known, it is attractive to speculate whether most or all faults of similar strike and dip are not premineral and whether others of different strike

The mine is accessible by trail or tramway from the base of the ridge, as it is nearly 1,000 feet higher. It was located in 1896, but only a little work was done before December, 1914, when it was leased toW. S. Hutchinson and associates, of Boston, Mass. Before· the lease was surrendered in 1916, 49 cars containing 1,768 tons of zinc ore with a little lead were shipped.

There are two groups of workings-the main workings, which were the source of most of the ores, shown in Figure 38, and another group, 400 feet west, on the top of the ridge. The first group explores a shoot that lies roughly parallel to the bedding at the middle of the cherty Anchor limestone, here altered to dolomite.

breccia contains considerable wulfenite in the form of flat waxen-yellow crystals, many of which are entirely covered with a coating of fine crystals of calamine. Dark-green cuprodescloizite is. found here and there. The dolomite walls are much ·brecciated and either cemented by hydrozincite in process of replacing it or by other carbonates, such as aragonite. The breccia, however, is limited by a roof that is scarcely broken and is probably a bedding plane, as it dips gently southwest. Apparently, the shoot of oxidized minerals coincides . closely with the original position of the deposit of sphalerite. Along the fault that passes through the. middle of the deposit the northeast side has dropped 15 feet. It is a narrow, single break, and no ore was observed in the breccia.

however, was done during the war by lessees. After four years of idleness the mine was reopened in 1924 and shipments were made by'" A. 0. Jacobsen. ·The claims belong to the estate of A. G. Campbell. The ,principal workings include the inclined shaft on the May claim (fig. 39), 235 feet deep. There are three levels, 79, 116, and 169 feet vertically below the surface, but the deepest work, 211 feet below the surface, is at the bottom of the 110-foot winze from the second level.
Geologic features.-Structurally as well as mineralogically the Kirby deposit is one of the most uncommon and interesting in the district. The workings explore a series of veins that lie in a crushed zone ·in shale and dolomite a short distance east of an extensive fault.· Only dolomite is shown on the surface, but at several places underground the workings crosscut 20 to 40. feet of alternating greenish shale and thin beds of dolomite. These beds are a part of the Goodsprings formation and lie about 200 feet below the Ironside dolomite. . As shown on the geologic map of the district, the deposit lies about midway between an extensive syncline on the south and the Keystone thrust on the north. Dikes of granite porphyry lie several hundred feet west and north of the mine, and others lie farther north, near the Keystone mine.

two shallow shafts several hundred feet north of the Kirby shaft.
The outstanding features of the. mineralogy may be summarized as follows:
Surface to 40-foot level: Siliceous limonite abundant; plumbic jarosite abundant; powdery turgite abunaant; yellow plumbojarosite sparse; cerusite reported; cream-colored chert absent; alunite not observed.
Forty-foot level to first level: Chert, locally with plumbic jarosite, abundant; siliceous limonite sparse; turgite sparse; plumbojarosite abundant; cerusite abundant; alunite common.
First level to second level: Chert, locally with plumbic jarosite, common but only sparsely decomposed; siliceous limonite absent; powdery .turgite absent; plumbojarosite abundant; cerusite ·abundant; alunite abundant in wall rocks.
Second level to bottom of 110-foot winze: Chert sparse; · ·plumbic jarosite not noted; plumbojarosite abundant;. siliceous
limonite absent; earthy limonite common; cerusite abundant; alunite common in w~ll rock.
The explored part of the ore deposit is therefore characterized by cerusi te and considerable plumbojarosite, with minor plumbic jarosite, in ·a g·angue composed largely of chert. The unoxidized vein has not been explored, but undoubtedly it is largely pyrite and galena.
The chemical processes apparently involved in weathering of the deposit may be briefly summarized. (See p. 98.) By weathering, free sulphuric acid and ferrous and ferric sulphates were set free. The sulphuric acid attacked the clay gouge of the veil); and shale in the wall,. formi:r;:tg alunite and setting free silica, which, migrating locally, deposited chert. As most of the chert lies above the zone of abundant alunite, however, some of the chert must have another ·origin. The extent of decay of the chert in the upper -levels. indicates that some silica is being constantly ·dissolved above and deposited lower down in the vein. ·On the other hand, some silica is constantly being fixed .in the surficial zone and, as erosion progresses, removed from the area.
There appears to be no pure potassium jarosite in .the mine; all the jarosite probably contains some lead.· Although it has not been identified, some plumbic jarosite must be present in the zone where alunite is formed; some undoubtedly has formed later through the attack of cerusite by sulphate waters bearing potash. In the upper zone of the' mine plumbojarosite is constantly being brokeri down, leaving pow<;iery turgite. . Some of this lead undoubtedly reacts with plumbic jarosite lower down to make new plumbojarosite. It would appear that any plumbic jarosite not converted to yellow plumbojarosite remains stable until it is near or at the surface. Plumbojarosite does ·· not appear to be stable at the surface in this region, however.
It is concluded that at the Kirby mine a jarosite chert zone is constantly being broken down by decay near the outcrop and re-forming about 100 feet lower, in . part by replacing vein gouge and near-by shale and in

part by deposition in open spaces. Potash, silica, and some of the lead are therefore kept in a surficial zone by a cyclic process.
Prod~ction.-The production of the Kirby mine can only be estimated approximately. The accompanying table, compiled fron1 records submitted to the United States Geological Survey, includes that of the Ruth mine also. There is some error in reporting the zinc production for 1917, as the owner and those who live near by insist that sufficient zinc minerals to ship have never been found on any of the company's claims. The table probably includes also the production of the John mine. According to 1\llr. Allen G. Campbell, son of the original owner, a total of 65 cars of ore, or about 2,000 tons, has been shipped from the Kirby and John shafts, of which 15 cars were shipped prior to 1915:
The records of 24 cars shipped by a lessee, F. C. O'Kelley, during 1916, show a range for lead of 9.7 to 20.6 per cent and an average of about 14 per cent; a range of silver from 2.70 to 5.70 ounces to the ton; insoluble matter, 10 to 35 per cent; iron, 25 to 43 per cent; zinc, trace to 1.60 per cent. The gold content has never exceeded 0.025 ounce to the ton.
Lessees have shipped all the ore since 1915, and there is no record of profits from operation.

JOHN MINE

On the John clain1 of the Kirby group there is a single shaft that has been the scene of most of the exploration. and several near-by prospect pits. The
shaft extends southwest for 10 feet on au incline of
38°; then vertically downward for 30 feet. A glory hole fron1 which the shaft starts is about 50 by 25 by 40 feet and ·has been the source of most of the ore. These workings explore a zone under the Ironside dolomite, where it is broken by a fault that trends N. 15° E. and dips 80° W. Here, as at the fault on the west side of the Kirby mine, the western block has moved forward (northeastward) and upward, so that it is related to other faults of the thrust period. The country rock is the dark-gray dolomite of the Goodsprings formation, which here strikes northwest and dips 50° SW.
The detailed structural relations of the ore that has been shipped are obscure. There is now considerable

The largest body of ore encountered in the shaft was a pipelike mass from 5 to 10 feet wide, 15 to 25 feet in stope length, and 50 feet in pitch length. It lay west of the shaft, largely above the drift at 66 feet. It is not shown in Figure 42.

ZINC AND LEAD MINES

147

AKRON MINE
On the Akron claim (No. 40, pl. ~0), located in 1905, there is a shaft 95 feet deep, inclined at 52° to 63°, from which there are levels at 60 and 95 feet. A tunnel frOin the west 1neets the shaft 30 feet below the top. These workings lie about 1,000 feet east of the Bill Nye and at a slightly higher stratigraphic position. I-Im·e the beds are locally folded as well as crushed along northwestward-trending faults. Earthy zinc carbonnte with some calamine was struck at several places, and it is reported that the mine has yielded 4 or 5 cars of zinc ore, which is not included in the production of the Bill Nye mine.
About 500 feet north of the BilLNye shaft there is a LO-foot prospect sunk on a vein of yellowish-green cuprodescloizite which cements a dolomite brecciathat lies parallel to the bedding. The width locally attai.ns 5 inches of Inaterial that should contain 10 per cent of vanadic oxide. J. A. Egger and others mined and shipped 7 tons of this 1naterial.
SURPRISE MINE
The Surprise claiin (No. 41, pl. 30) lies west of the Fredrickson and covers an area near the top of the ridge above the Columbia Pass road, 3 miles west of Goodsprings. From the end of a tunnel, 230 feet long, a shaft has been sunk 90 feet at an inclination of 40°. There are short drifts at several levels and at the botto1n. These workings explore a breccia zone at the base of the Bird Spring formation nearly parallel to the bedding. In the upper part there is a stope 20 feet long by 15 feet high and 3 to 4 feet wide. There is a record of the shipment of 10 tons of mixed lead-zinc ore (25 per cent of lead and 15 per cent of zinc) and of 31 tons of ore containing 36 per cent of zinc. Most of the work was done during 1916 and 1917 by the Azalia Mining Co.
FREDRICKSON MINE
The Fredrickson mine (No. 42, pl. 30) lies 800 feet south of the main road over Columbia Pass, 2 miles west of Goodsprings. It was first located by Jesse Jones in 1897, but no assessment work was done, and it was relocated by J. A. Egger in 1905. The explorations above the 100-foot level, except some stopes, were 1nade by Wadey and Fredrickson prior to 1912,59 but those below that level were made by the Goodsprings Dividend Mining Co. from 1915 to 1917. Since then it has been leased several times.

o All crude except in 1915 and 1916. b Concentrate. c From Singer mine, operated by Fredrickson and Springer.

The workings of the nune explore a zone in the Yellowpine limestone. At three places in the mine a fine-grained brownish shaly sandstone is exposed in the roof over the stopes. Doubtless it is the sandstone at the base of the Bird Spring formation, for characteristic fossils of the lowest zone of that formation were collected on the spur above the mine (collection No. 37a).
In this area the beds trend N. 40° to 50° E. and dip 20° SE. With regard to structure, the Fredrickson mine is one of several mines that lie within a short distance of the Fredrickson fault, largely within 1,000 feet and on the west side. The fault is marked by reefs ~>f dolomite breccia as much as 30 feet thick and 20 feet high several hundred feet northeast of the n1ine. The base of the Bird Spring formation west of the fault abuts against dolomitized Sultan limestone east of the fault, so that the dip slip along it is about 500 feet. For a mile southeast of the mine the near-by beds are extensively dolomitized.
The workings are shown in Figure 43. The stopes of the mine may be considered in three groups. The stopes along and above the second level yielded leadbearing hydrozincite that replaced dolomite underlying the shaly sandstone. The dolomite is not as much broken as in many other mines of this district where the ore shoot lies along a definite steatum, but there are several northwest faults of ~mall displacement. Most of these faults dip northeast and are probably postmineral. The stope above the third level, locally called the ''silver stope," was from 2 to 5 feet high and yielded crushed dolomite coated sporadically with silver minerals, probably largely chloride. This material was milled with the product of other parts of the mine and served to enrich the

According to one of the owners, most ·of the product of the shoot contained 0.75 per cent of vanadic oxide. No attempt was made to so~t it out, and the vanadate passed into the lead concentrate of the mill. In this stope, as well as in that nearest the surface, thin coatings of carmine cinnabar were observed in the car. bonate and sulphate of lead coating the galena.

ARGENTENA MINE
The workings of the .4-rgentena mine (No. 44, pl. 30) lie near the crest of the narrow ridge about a mile southeast of the Fredrickson niine and about 3 miles
southwest of Goodsprings. Most of the existing
work has been done since January, 1926, by the Argentena Co~solidated Mining Co. on the Galen~ claim, located in 1887 by A. S. Campbell and A. E. Thomas. Production began with ·the shipment of·

The ore-bearing ground in both tunnels is limited eastward by a northwa.rd-trending fault that appears to be continuous throughout the workings and postmineral. On the east side of the ridge lower workings have encountered lea.d ore at the sa.me horizon. . In addition to the common lead and zinc minerals a yellowish vanadate, probably descloizite, is rather common and is especially abundant on workings on the east slope of the ridge.· It forms thin mam1nillary coatings on the dolomite breccia. In places the galena is embedded in brown chert which cements dolomite breccia. For 100 feet or more the drift south from the south tunnel reveals bedded veins of barite, locally 1 foot or more wide. The ba.rite is coarsely crystalline and clearly replaces the dolomitized limestone.

VOLCANO AND NE~R-BY MINES
The Volcano claim lies on the east edge of Table Mountain; 3 miles southwest of Goodsprings. In. an area· scarcely 200 feet in diameter there are several short tunnels and shallow shafts that explore irregular shoots of galena disseminated through ·dolomitized parts of the Yellowpine limestone. The shoots are parallel· to the local bedding, which is nearly north; the dip is 5°: W. According to Allen S. Campbell, one of the owners, about 10. carloads (300 tons) of zinc and lead ore has· been shipped from the workings.
The Pro1netheus claim adjoins the Volcano claim on the north. Some shallow tunnels and open cuts explore small shoots such as are exposed on the Volcano claim. According to the owner, C. A. Beck, the shipments include 20 tons of lead O!e and 70 tons of zinc ore.

LOOKOUT,.. A.NNEX, AND MOUNTAIN TOP MINES
The Lookout and Annex mines (No. 45, pl. 30) and the Mountain Top mine (No. 46, pl. 30) form a group that lies near the crest of a high ridge 3 miles south of Goodsprings. They are accessible by a road to the foot of the ridge, where trails lead to the several tunnels. The Mountain Top clain1 was one ·of those located by A. G. Campbell prior to 1893, and in that year it was referred to as one of the most promising in the district.60 'fhe Lookout was located several

years· later by' Campbell, but the Annex was not located until 1907, when P. H. Springer recognized the fact· that ore had been extracted north of the side line of the Lookout claim. These ·claims were worked intermittently until about 1913 and then almost steadily by ·lessees until 1919. In 1924 the Lookout and Annex pr:oduced ore. A number of separate- deposits have been worked on these claims, but as they have n1any similarities and the records of production of the first two claims have not been kept separate by the owners, they will be described as a group.
All the deposits on these claims lie in a thin stratigraphic zone, probably less than 100 feet thick, near the base of the Bird Spring formation. In. this area tbe limestones dip gently west, so that the outcrop of· the zone closely follows a contour around the hill. The Fredrickson fault, whieh is. traceable from the north 2 miles and from the south in Deadmans Canyon, doubtless passes along ;the east edge of the hill but is obscured locally by numerous minor fractures. As in the· valley south of the ·Fredrickson ·mine and in Deadmans Canyon, this fault is the channel fron1 which rising solutions have spread outward into the beds on both sides and converted the limestone into dolomite.
There are 13 openings along the out~ropping zone in a distance of 3,000 feet, and although probably all have'been sources of ore, most of the output has come from four. At the northwest end a tunnel extends 75 feet south,' and from it stopes have been· extended it'regularly both . ways about 40 feet; the range in' height is 3 to 5 feet. These workings explore a ho.rizontal zone of broken dolomite in which coarse masses of galena are sporadically distributed. No zinc minerals were· noted in the workings, but many fragments on the dunip were coated with an olive-green vanadate, probably cuprodescloizite. This tunnel was pl'Obably the source of a shipment of 36 tons of ore in 1918 that contained 9.26 per cent of vanadic oxide and was sold for $2,602. · This is the largest shipment of vanadiumbearing ores yet made from the district. Of the material sorted from this shipment, 5.38 tons contained 11.50 ounces of silver to the ton and 43.90 per cent of lead.
Several hundred leet eas_t of this tunnel is another, which extends S. 35° W. 125 feet and from which flat stopes extend 40 feet west and 60 feet east; the range in height is 4 ·to lQ feet. In these workings there is a persistent zone 1 to 2 feet thick that contains many irregular masses of coarsely crystalline galena embedded in dolomite, but masses of galena were also found sporadically above this zone.· Here it seems clear that the distribution of galena is detern1ined by the flat zone of crushed dolomite, neady parallel to the bedding·. Zinc minerals are not conspicuous, but a little brown hydrozincite is present here and there, and screenings from the lead ore contain 18

which is deposited near the galena, largely in the spaces between the dolomite fragments.

The largest stope of the Hoosier 1ni~e lies at t~e eastern or upper end of the explored area and extends irregularly northward about 150 feet from the two upper tunnels. Over 1nost of the area the stope is 3 to 6 feet wide but in several places it attains 12 feet. It is limited upward by a good wall, apparently a bedding plane, that trends N. 20° W. and dips 15° SW. Above this wall the beds are not much disturbed, but below it the dolomite is brecciated and recemented by coarse white calcite. Galena is the most abundant mineral; it forms coarse crystals or lenses in the dolomite breccia, but in the walls of the large stope it is largely altered to cerusite. In .the lower or western workings, fresh galena forms coarse angular masses in the dolomite, but the white· calcite is absent, and the rock is very hard and coherent. Zinc minerals, largely hydrozincite, are common in the large stope

The area is much broken up and is limited eastward by a thrust fault along which the upper part of the Monte Cristo limestone rests upon the lower part of the Bird Spring formation. (See p. 51.)
According to Rex Ewing, one of the owners, the shear zone includes a shoot of cuprodescloizite and galena, 4 to 6 feet wide, which contains about 2 per cent of vanadic oxide. One sample collected over a width of 7 feet contained 3.65 per cent of vanadium oxide.

and probttbly the source of 1nost of the ore is flat and

nearly parallel to the bedding. The bulge at the

south end is limited by a northeastward-trending

fault that seems to have been formed after the depo-

sition of the zinc sulphide but before that mineral

was altered to hydrozincite. A little calamine occurs

here and there through the workings, but it is largely

on fractures that cut the hydrozincite. 'These work-

ings still yield many specin1ens that show the replace-

ment of dolomite by amorphous hydrozincite.

· 'fhe largest body of zinc ore on Bonanza Hill was

encountered in a tunnel at the east end of the claims.

Ore was :first struck in the tunnel 100 feet fr01n the

mouth, but the largest ~od.y lay pu.rallel to the bedding

75 feet farther in. It was explored by a winze to it

depth of 40 feet and for a distance of 100 feet along

the strike. The gross value of the zinc ore mined

fron1 the stope during 1915 and 1916 is reported to

have been about $30,000.

·

The following summary of the production of this

group of claims is compiled from the records of the

United States Geological Survey. The separate

annual shipments do not exactly agree with those

recently submitted by Mr. Root to the writer; but

his total-2,405 tons-is only a little lower than

that given-2,575. Mr. Root thinks that the differ-

ence, 170 tons, was derived from other workings· on

the hill.

As in the Singer, the workings lie wholly within the block of dolomitized limestones of the Monte Cristo formation that are thrust over beds of the Bird Spring forn1ation. The beds are n1uch disturbed but locally strike northeast and dip 35° to 50° SE.
The principal workings are a tunnel, which contains about 400 feet of drifts, and four shafts and winzes. (See fig. 47.) The ·country rock is Bullion dolomite. Ore has been mined from at least four ~n1all shoots, three of which lie on a persistent fault or spurs from it, and the other lies on a minor fault that is probably related to it in age. The largest stope overlies No. 3 wmze and extends irregularly up to the surface. The

SULTAN MINE
The Sultan group of 12 claims (No. 54, pl. 30) lies along the east slope of the prominent. ridge a mile north of Little Devil Peak. The Sultan claim, which has yielded most of the ore, was located in 1896 by W. R. Sloane, but little work was done before 1910, a.nd most of the· ore was shipped during 1916 to 1918. A dry concentrating mill was erected in 1916.· The property 1s now owned ·by Henry· Robbins. (See pl. 35, B.)
The production of the Sultan mine is shown in the accompanying table, which exactly checks that recorded in the books of the owner. The owner's records show that 2,446 tons of crude zinc ore and concentrate and 1,289 tons of crude lead ore and concentrate have been shipped. Most of the z1nc ore was shipped in 1915 and 1916; most of the lead ore in 1917 and 1918. The zinc ore contained from 28 to 42 per cent of zinc, 2 to 7 per cent of lead, 6 to 30 ounces of silver to the ton, and 3 to 13 per cent of msoluble matter. The lead ore contained from 30 to 60 per cent of lead, 6 to 14 per cent of zinc, 10 to 30 ounces of silver to the ton, and 1 to 3 per cent of 'nsoluble matter. The gross value of 3,620 tons of both classes of ore was about $200,000, and the net value, after paying railroad freight and treatment charges, $155,000.
The Sultan mill, erected in 1916, is 500 ·feet east of the mouth of the main tunnel. As received from the mine the ore was· delivered to three bins, from which it was passed over 1}~-inch screens. The coarse material was sorted to yield a smelting product; the tindersize was crushed first in a jaw crusher and then in rolls and elevated to screens. Classified material was delivered to a Stebbins dry concentration table.

The geologic relations of the Sultan deposit are almost unique, and the mine workings yield data that· are useful in interpreting the regional geology. The workings explore a part of the breccia zone that marks the position of the Sultan thrust fault. At this place it is wider than elsewhere and locally attains a width

of 800 feet. The limits of the breccia zone~are simple

fractures, but between these fractures the material is

in large .part thoroughly crushed. In some areas the

rock is merely broken but not much disturbed, so that

traces of bedding remain. Elsewhere there are exten-

sive zones of angular breccia in which few fragments

exceed a foot in diameter. In the mine workings

there are persistent fractures marked by clean walls in

the midst of the breccia, and the ore bodies seem to

be closely related to these. Most of the ore lies above

and close to these fractures. They trend N. 30° to
45° ·w. and dip mostly 60° to 80° NE.; one is vertical.

(See pl. 37.)

The rocks that limit the breccia on the southwest

are limestone beds near the middle of the Sultan formation, whi~h ~re· slightly arched to form a local

anticline. The beds northeast of the brecci~ zone are

locally dolomitized limestones of the Bird Spring

formation about 1,000 fee~ above the base. The

breccia now consists wholly of dolomite fragments

the main tunnel the breccia is cemented by white

From ·the dip of the fracture surfaces and the nature

of the displacement one migp.t ~onclude that the

breccia follows a normal fault. That it is not a normal

fault but a. thrust fault: afterward tilted, is shown by

the extent and regional relations of the breccia zone.

The breccia zone and limiting fractures may be trace~

readily 3 miles southeast to Devil Canyon, where the

zone ends abruptly at a cross fault, southeast of which

there is an overturned anticline that extends beyond

the New Year mine. Also, eastward from the Sultan

mmiintiez'edthMeroenatereCtrhisretoe

blocks of brecciated and doloand Sultan limestones that rest

on crumpled but undolomitized Bird Spring formation.

The surface that separates these forma~ions is ob-

viously the eastward extension of the Sultan thrust,

now broken by several normal faults. (See section I-J,

pl. 2.) This area and the mine workings thus indicate

that the entire· ridge in which the Sultan mine lies has

been tilted southwestward, toward Mesquite Valley,

as much as 20° and possibly a little more.

The ridge east of the mine is m'ade up of well-

bedded fine tuffs that dip as much as 22° E. They lie

on a surface that slopes about 20° E. and is cut across

the breccia zone ·and adjacent limestones. The

source of these tuffs may have been either the Sultan ..

crater, a mile to the northwest, or the small crater

that lies a mile to the west on the west side of the ridge.

If the tuffs were deposited before the ridge was tilted

20° W., they would scarcely be expected to dip as

much .as 20° E. now. It therefore appears that the

·tuffs were deposited after the tilting of the range and th~t they may have been erupted in rather recent

geologic ti_me (Miocene?).

Ship1nents were n1ade first by Patrick Cla.rke in 1908, and it then passed to Douglas White a.nd George Wheaton, who organized the Mpnte Cristo Consolidated Mining Co., 'which now owns it.

Undm~ lease from Sept~ember, 1911, to August, 1913, Duncan, Fredrickson & Belt shipped 145 cars of hydrozincite and calmnine-bearing ore, some of it sorted from the dump.

The deposit is uncommonly interesting because only zi.n'c ore was encountered, and it was an exceptionally concentrated body, as one ma.y readily suspect by the size of the workings and the meager dump. It lies wholly in the cherty Anchor limestone of the Monte Cristo formation,· which is not as extensively dolomitized het·e as farther north. The limestone is well shown several hundred feet east of the mine, where the color is blue-gray. and the textut·e dense and porcelainlike. It contains ·conspicuous· layers of dark chert nodules. The strike is neady north and the dip 25° W. The deposit is located between two faults that strike N. 35° W. and dip 50° NE. (See fig. 6.) Doubtless these faults were formed after the zinc sulphide deposit was intmduced but before most of the oxidation to carbonate and silicate had taken place. They have been traced several thousand feet southeast.
The workings developed a shoot of exceptionally pure zinc ore that pitched about 20° SW. The upper limit of the stope is a bedding plane, but the sides and botton1 were irregular in detail. A number of breaks

No hydrozincite may now be seen in the southwest half of the stope, but calamine is common in the latest workings at the west end. In large part this calamine replaces both dolomite and chert, but here and there it is deposited in vugs and on cracks. Doubtless it formed a considerable part of the latest ore shipments.
The only other conspicuous minerals noted were wax-colored calcite, which forms large plumose masses near the open cut, and ferruginous chert, which occurs with the calamine that has replaced the original chert.

Bullion claim dates from 1900, when W. H. Smith

located it, but others may have filed locations earlier.

According to local report, it was sold to S. E. Yount

and G. E. Fayle in 1912 f.or $3,000. They built a mill

in 1913 and sold it in 1916 to .the present owner, the

Bullion Mining Co., of Salt· Lake City. Since 1919 it

has been worked by lessees.

.

The total production of the mine to the end. of 1923,

as reported to the United States Geological Survey and

the Bureau of Mines, is given below. Most of the

product, 3,869 tons, has been lead ore containing 50 to

75 per cent of lead, 1 to ·5 per cent of zinc, and 2 to 15

ounces of silver to the ton. About 300 tons of zinc ore

containing 36 to 45 per cent of zinc has been shipped.·

The shipments of mixed lead and zinc ore have been

393 tons, largely containing 40 to 50 per cent of both

metals combined. The second table shows the quan-

tity and value of the shipments made by the Bullion

Mines Co. after it acquired the property in 1916.

The principal workings include a shaft inclined west-

ward under the hill from which levels are run at four

depths and a long winze northward. Near the surface

the slope of the shaft is 25°, but it increases to 53° at the third level and to 68° at the bottom; at that point it is 165 feet vertically below the mouth. (See pl. 39.) .Another group of workings lies 700 feet northeast, but as a late normal fault follows the intervening gulch the ore bodies ·explored by both groups of workings were probably once closely associated.

a Mixed ore.
The ore bodies explored by the Bullion mine lie largely near the base of the Bullion dolomite, but in places ~hey extend down into the Anchor limestone. In this region the BulliQn dolomite is a distinct layer about 200 feet thick of white to cream-colored coarsely crystalline dolomite, broken by many fractures. Near the mine the Anchor limestone is completely dolomitized; and locally, as along the trail from the mill to the mine, the Crystal Pass limestone is also dolomitized. Th~ beds trend N. 10° W. and dip 30° W. There are several normal faults in the neighborhood of the Bullion mine along which the beds are displaced from 100 to· 250 feet. Most of these faults trend N. 30° to 45° W. and dip 45° NE. and belong to the group of postmineral normal faUlts. Although many welldefined breccia zones and fd.ults are exposed in the workings, the displacements along them must be small, a! none displace the beds on the surface as much as 25

feet. Most of these faults trend N. 30° to 60° W. and
dip northeast and are doubtless postmineral. The structural associations of the Bullion deposit
are almost unique and find their nearest counterpart in those at the Potosi mine. At the Bullion, as at the Potosi, it is difficult to present a clear picture of the extent of the stopes and their relations. The outstanding feature is a persistent smooth hanging wall of rudely circular outline. This wall is continuously exposed on the first level, and two large sectors are shown on the second level. (See pl. 39.) The dip ranges from 20° to 31°, and it clearly cuts across .the bedding of the dolomite. The deeper work from the winze northward is above this wall and does not encounter any ·ore. The deeper work off the main shaft westward is probably under ~his wall if it continues downward, but conditions are complicated by the· presence of a southwestward dipping fault tpat may

160

GEOLOGY AND ORE DEPOSITS OF GOODSPRINGS QUADRANGLE, NEVADA

merge with the wall below the second level. Several of the faults that trend northwest and dip northeast cut across the hanging wall and are probably postmineral.
The ore-bearing material is angular dolomite breccia, the fragments of which range from }lalf an inch to 5 feet in diameter. Th~se fragments are feebly cemented by a carbonate mate~ial, but there are still many unfilled voids. The ore bodies are rudely tabular masses, largely 3 'to 6 feet wide, that a:re nearly parallel to the hanging wall. Galena was the principal mineral, although lenses of hydrozincite may still be seen in which that mineral replaces the dolomite. Part of the galena forms coarse crystals that replace the dolo. mite, but some have crystallized in the open spaces. Most of the stopes south of the shaft (Dane, Dream) range from 5 to 10 feet high, but in an irregular area north of the shaft one stope is 40 feet high. If there is a well-defined footwall under the stopes, as at the Potosi mine, it has not been found. No satisfactory explanation can be offered for the structural origin of such a body of breccia. If there were evidence of solution of the dolomite one might imagine that there had been solution along a minor breccia zone followed by collapse, sornewhat like the supposed origin of the "flats" of the Wisconsin-Illinois lead and zinc field; but no such evidence has been obtained. It seems necessary to conclude that the breccia is related to movements that took place during the epoch of thrust faulting.
Some ore has been struck in the raises above. the third and fourth levels, but it is not extensive and occurs in ground that has no open spaces.
Most of the galena in the mine is fr~sh and unweathered, but there is a little carbonate and sulphate as deep as the lowest work. Hydrozincite and calamine are the principal zinc minerals.
ANCHOR MINE
The Anchor mine (No. 62, pl. 30) is near the head of a deep gulch about 6 miles due south of Goodsprings. The mine workings lie 400 feet above the bottom of the gulch and are accessible only by trail or by tramway from the mill, 2,000 feet to the east. (See pl. 38, B.) Although the Monitor claim w~s located in 1893, all the workings are on the Anchor claim, located in 1897. One car of lead ore was shipped in 1908, but the principal activity on the property began in 1912,
when it was sold by S. E. Yount and George Fayle to
the .Goodsprings Anchor Co. (Seeley W. Mudd, F. A. Keith, and associates), of Los Angeles, at a price reported to have been $30,000. The company ceased

operations in April, 1919, but since that time several gro.gps of lessees have worked the mille intermittently.
'.I;'he mine is explored by a shaft 202 feet deep on an indine of 38°, frorn which~ there are three levels. From the third level there is a winze 212 feet deep at an ·inclination that decreases from 37° .at the top to 29:0 ·at the bottom; The deepest work is 227 feet ver£jcally below the outcrop. (See pl.· 40.) In the development of the. mine the workings.were quickly ex_t~nded downward, so that late in 1916 most of the are~ had been explored. None of the principal shoots wer.e found after that time, and most of the subsequent WQ:fk consisted of mining the earlier known bodies. · Production.-Records of production for the Anchor m~ne are available from two sources, the ·annual statem~~ts submitted by the owners to the United States Geological Survey and the books of the company. Tl)e two should agree exactly, but they do not. The company's records are presented in addition to those of the Survey because they show the number of tons of.zinc, zinc-lead, and lead ore shipped as well as gross and net returns. The crude lead ore cornmonly contained about 50 per cent of lead and less than 10 per cent of zinc, but the concentrate made in the mill commonly contained slightly rnore of both lead and zinc. In· the early years the zinc product commonly contained 35 to 42 per cent of zinc, but when the price of zinc rose to the peak, in 1915, shipments commonly contained 26 to 35 per cent of zinc.
-The mill contained a grizzly, picking belt, jaw crusher, rolls, elevator screens, and Stebbins dry table. In .1924 a classifier and table adapted to wet concentra.tion were installed, in order to re-treat. the tailings fro~ previous operations.

The workings include two shafts, a short tunnel, and _several irregular stopes in an area scarcely 300 feet in diameter. The shafts are now inaccessible, but according to Mr. Fredrickson, who sunk them, they explored zones of brecciated dolomite that contained some ore. The principal breccia zone trends north.., .west, and 50 feet below the surface it connected with a horizontal body of zinc ore that lay parallel to the bedding. The stope fron1 which the ore was removed was 40 by 70 feet by 3 or 4 feet high. The principal ore mineral was hydroziricite, in which grains and crystals of galena were distributed. Some smithsonite and calamine were· found, but oxidized lead minerals were uncommon. Only in the westernmost tu:pnel did it pay to separate the lead from the zinc minerals.

The stoped area above the tunnel level is irregular in

shape, and the size is about 100 by 75 feet. The width

of the stope ra.nges from 1 to 3 feet, and the average
is about IX feet. It is especia1ly noteworthy that the

ferruginous chert lense.s in the ore zone are thicker and

more extensive in the upper 75 feet than below. In

the workings below the tunnel the chert is only sporad-

had been located under several names as early as 1891, but the present name was given in 1904, when it was located by Jes~e Jones. About 1906, when the old shaft was 90 feet deep, it was sold for $5,000. In 1910 it was bought for $12,000 by Jesse Knight and associates who forn1od the Goodsprings Mining Co. Most ·of the work since 1917 has been done by C. L. and J. A. Ifyde. The 4-.ddison claim was located in' 1899. by Addison Bybee, and after several transfers it was so.ld to ICnight and his n.ssociates for $10,000.

The princ1pal exploration on the Milford claim is an inclined ;shaft 380 feet deep on the slope, which has an inclination of 35° for 280 feet and of 29° for. the lower 100 feet. There are four levels. (See fig. 53.) A wil·e-rope tratnway delivers ore from the bins at the shaft to ore bins 500 feet below. There are several tunnels on the Addison claim, but only the longest, which was the source of the ore, is shown in Figure 54.
ofThe structural conditions are rather simple on the
west end the Milford ridge, ·but they become progressively more complex eastward. Near the Milford mine beds are exposed that range from the .base of the Monte Cristo limestone to a horizon se~eral

hundred feet above the base of the Bird Spring forma.: tion. They trend N. 50° to 65° W. and dip 25° to 35° SW. The shaly Arrowhead limestone crops out above the Addison n1ine workings as well as near the Ingomar mine, 800 feet higher, but was not noted southwest of the Milford mine. The ore bodies of the Milford mirie ·closely follow the contact of the Bullion dolomite and underlying Anchor limestone. The line of contact of the dolomite and limestone may be readily examined westward for 1,000 feet until it passes under the wash. Although broadly the contact is parallel to the bedding, it locally departs 5· to 10 feet from a simple surface. Close examination of tllls contact shows that within 1,000 feet west of the Milford shaft it is broken by nine faults. The~e are separable into two groups according to their dip. The first group of six faults trend from north toN. 40° W. and dip steeply west, and along· these the west or hanging walls have dropped 8 to 40 feet. These faults are marked by zones of breccia 2 to 10 feet wide, in which angular fragments of creatn-colored dolomite are cemented by' white dol01nite. Most of thes~ zones have been explored by pits and short tunnels for the galena which they contain. The seco;nd group of three faults trends N. 4'0° to 50° W., dips 45° to 60° NE., and contains no galena. Along these faults the northeast or hanging wall has dropped 4 to 75 feet. Wholly apart from the record of underground explorations, one would conclude that the westward-dipping group are premineral and the northeastward-dipping group postmineral.
Five rather distinct ore bodies have been found in the M.ilford mine. The two upper and most northeasterly bodies are not sufficiently accessible to permit their structural relations to be ascertained. The middle body is a vertical lens 3 to 6 feet wide and has been stoped as much as 25 feet above the 100-foot level. It follows a breccia zone that cuts across the bedding but does not extend west of a galena-bearing fracture (A, fig. 53) that appears in the shaft. A similar body was mined east of a winze below the 300foot level-the Kirk stope. This stope is 1 to 2 fe.et wide and 10 ·to 20 feet high and yielded the 295 tons of lead ore shipped in 1923. The galena occurred in a breccia zone . between walls of unaltered Anchor limestone and thus is one of the two bodies in the district not surrounded by ·dol01nite. The lowest body in the mine is that stoped in badly broken ground above the 200-foot level a:q.d 240-foot sublevel (the Bullion stope). Above the 200-foot level the body lay ·almost parallel· to the bedding, but below that level it pitched north across the bedding. Ore ceased westward against a fault (B, fig. 53) that bears galena on the 200 and 300 foot levels and is clearly premineral. W~st of fault B on the 200-foot level, a bedding-planA fracture contains a little gR.lena.

The Ingomar clain1 (No. 72, pl. 30) was first located about 1884 by Jonas Taylor and was relocated several times before 1904, when D. W. Johnson undertook to mine ore. Johnson and Fayle did all the work between 1905 and 1915, when they sold it to S. S. Arentz and W. A. Perkins at a price reported to be $8,500. These owners worked the property until February, 1919, and it was idle until May, 1923, when L. M. Benson leased it. The Milford No. 2 clain1 (No. 71, pl. 30) was located in 1904 by Jesse Jones, but most of the present work was done after it was bought by Arentz and Perkins in 1917. Recently it has been worked under lease by G. L. Mcintyre.
'fhe con1bined production of the Ingon1ar and J\1ilford No.2 mines is shown in the following table, which has been compiled from the records of the United States Geological Survey. As there is no record of production from the Milford No. 2 n1ine prior to 1918, and there was none from the Ing01nar between February, 1919, and May, 1923, the total production of the Milford No. 2 is esthnated at n.bout 450 tons, probably largely lead ore, whereas that ~f the Ingo1nar 1nine is about 4,030 tons, largely zinc n.nd 1nixed lead and zinc. ore. The reeords of 12 cars shipped in 1918 show the zinc ore to contn.in 42 to 46 per cent of zinc and the ntixed ore 23 to 30 per cent of zinc and 17 to 25 per cent of lead. One car of lead ore contained 72 per cent of lead and 3.3 ounces of silver to the ton.

No. 2 claim is 450 feet long, but recently ore has been mined at another tunnel farther·east on the ridge.
The ridge in which these mines are located presents a complicated structural problem, and close study would be necessary to unravel it thoroughly. The entire ridge forms part of a block that.has been thrust forward and upward about 1,000 feet along the Milford thrust. T'vo minor thrust faults overlie this thrust and probably merge with it in depth. The mine workings on this ridge, however, all lie west of a northwestward-trending normal fault that dips steeply west and pas.ses slightly east of the Milford No. 2 workings. Along this fault the upper or western block, that which contains the ore deposits, has dropped

• According to local report, four cars or ore, about 100 tons, were shipped in 1905.

The principal workings on the Ingomar claim are three tunnels whose total length is about 1,000 feet. (Sec fig. 55.) The principal tunnel on the Milford

about 300 feet. Another fault of the same type lies west of the Addison mine and therefore about 2,000 feet west of the 11ilford No.2 workings. The Ingomar and Milford No. 2 mine workings a.gain lie in a block of rocks that is limited downward by a flat fault that· trends northwest and dips 20° NE. This fault is well shown at the mouth of the Ingomar lower tunnel as well as both east and west of it for 1,000 feet. The upper block has moved northeastward 100 feet or more· with reference to the base. Galena was found in the breccia 200 feet west of the Ingomar tunnel, but it can not be stated with assurance that the fault was premineral. Finally, the Ingomar n1ine workings .. explore three northeastward-trending faults that dip northwest. Considerable ore has been stoped from two of these, so that they are undoubtedly premineral,

hut they terminate downward against the flat fnult described above. The beds exposed on this ridge range fron1 the .A.nchor 'limestone to the thin limestones near the base of the Bird Spring formation. They strike northwest and dip 35° to 40° SW. All the ore in these claims is derived from dolomitized parts of the Yellowpine lirnestone. ·
Most of the ore shipped from the Ingomar mine prior to 1919 came from two stopes that follow the northeast faults. One of these stopes is above the lower tunnel on fault B, is roughly 40 by 50 feet and 2 to 6 feet wide, and extends to the surface. The other lies largely along fault A and extends irregularly from the intermediate tunnel to and above the upper tunnel. The only ore now visible in these stopes consists of hydrozincite and smithsonite, and though they may have yielded some lead, zinc minerals were greatly in excess. As some of the zinc carbonate was very pure it seems probable that these bodies may have been enriched by downwa.rd circulation of zinc from bodies now eroded. .The principal sources of high-grade lead ore in this mine have been two stopes that do not lie along the faults shown but along bedding planes where they are cut by minor fractures. One lies west of fault B in the lower tunnel, and the other west of fault A in the upper ttmnel. Although galena was present, nwst of the lead occurred as carbonate and sulphate.
The principal' working on the Milford No. 2 claim is a tunnel450 feet long from which. ore has been mined in three smaH st.opes. The largest stope is near the inner· end and is roughly 20 by 40 feet by 3 to 5 :feet wide. It follows a wall that trends N. 30° E. and dipR southeast. Another stope 25 by 25 feet follows a wall that trends north and dips west. As the local beds trend N. 70° W. and dip 35° S., the structural relations of the shoots closely resemble those found in the Ingomar mine.
During 1924 and 1925 G. L. Mcinty~e mined mixed lead and zinc ore from a tunnel 700 feet southeast of the tunnel described above.
