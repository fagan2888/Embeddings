[Seventh Annual Report.!
The publications of the United States Geological Survey are issued in accordance with the statute approved March 3, 1879, which declares that
"The publications of the Geological Survey shall consist of the annual report of operations, geological and economic maps illustrating the resources and classification cf the lands, and reports upon general and economic geology and paleontology. The annual report of operations of the Geological Survey shall accompany the annual report of I he Secretary of the Interior. All special memoirs and reports of said Survey shall be issued in uniform quarto series if deemed necessary by the Director, but otherwise in ordinary octavos. Throe thousand copies of each shall he published for scientific exchanges and for sale at the price of publication; and all literary and cartographic materials received in exchange shall be the property of the United States and form a part of the library of the organization: And the money resulting from the sale of such publications shall be covered into the Treasury of the United States."
On July 7, 1882, the following joint resolution, referring to all Government publications, was passed by Congress:
" That whenever any documentor report shall bo ordered printed by Congress, there shall be printed, in addition to the number in eacn case stated, the'usual number' (1,900) of copies for binding and distribution among those entitled to receive them."
Except in those cases in which an extra number of any publication has been supplied to the Survey by special resolution of Congress or has been ordered by the Secretary of the Interior, this office has no copies for gratuitous distribution.

SEVENTH ANNUAL REPORT OF THE UNITED STATES GEOLOGICAL SURVEY.
BY J. W. POWELL, DlEECTOE.
REMARKS ON THE PLAN AND ORGANIZATION OF THE SURVEY.
THE GEOGEAPHIC DIVISION.
At the time the Geological Survey was organized the field geologist found within his reach maps of very few portions of the country that he could utilize in delineating geologic phenomena ; accordingly, as has been fully set forth in previous reports, recourse was had to existing statutory authority for the organization of a geographic division. The chief functions of this division are: First, the prosecution of a topographic survey of the entire country; second, the preparation of topographic maps thereof, on. such scales as are required for the accurate delineation of geologic structure ; and, third, geodetic co-ordination of the topographic surveys in such manner that when they are completed and the topographic maps are combined they will constitute an accurate geographic map of the entire country, showing, with a good degree of exactness, its extent; its relations to contiguous countries; the boundaries of states, counties, &c.; the positions on the earth's surface of cities, towns, railways, highways, and other public cultural features; the creeks, rivers, lakes, coast lines, and other hydrographic features; and the mountains, hills, valleys, canons, plains, and other hypsographic features.
The prosecution of this topographic survey, unlike the original research of the geologist, is to a large extent a work of applied science; and, after the adoption of suitable methods
3

4 REPORT OF THE DIRECTOR
and standards, the surveys and the preparation of maps can be carried forward with few changes in organization save those demanded by changes in the field of operation. Experience has shown, however, that there is a constant improvement in methods and an elevation of standards.
Anterior to the organization of this division of the Geological Survey, topographic science and topographic art had received high development through other organizations in this country and in Europe; but to a large extent such work had been prosecuted with the object of producing charts for military purposes on the one hand or for fiscal purposes on the other: thus the art had been directed to the production of military maps and cadastral maps. During the last half century the science of geology, because of its great industrial importance, has been greatly developed; and as all the civilized nations of the earth have promoted and endowed geologic research and as geologic maps are among the most important results arising therefrom, the need for topographic maps as a basis for geologic maps has largely modified the mapmaking systems of the world. Yet the earlier purposes for which they were made largely prevailed, with the result of still producing maps chiefly valuable for military or cadastral uses. Now, such maps are on scales too large for general industrial purposes, and must represent such a variety of facts as to make them exceedingly complex ; still further, the multiplied data presented are to a large extent ephemeral, and the maps which represent them must be frequently revised by resurvey, redrawing, and re-engraving.
In developing the topographic work of the Geological Survey, especial attention has been given to the industrial pur. poses for which maps are made ; for the best topographic map for geologic purposes is also the best for other scientific and industrial purposes.
If a good topographic map of the country be constructed, having in view the representation of three classes of facts: first, public cultural features; second, hydrographic features ; third, hypsographic features, such a map is a proper basis for a geologic map. It is also a proper basis for all other maps

REPORT OP THE DIRECTOR.

designed for industrial purposes; it is a proper basis for general military maps, and provides the fundamental data for cadastral maps. And such a map of the United States is now in process of construction.
Having decided the scale and the class of facts to be represented upon the map, the survey in the field must be adjusted thereto for economic considerations; and this fact has been kept persistently in view in the organization of this branch of the service.
Although the method of representing relief in contours or grade curves has long been in vogue in this and other countries, these conventions have usually been supplemented by hachures or brush shading whenever it became necessary to represent widely diverse types of topography on the' same map. To a certain extent, therefore, the plan of representing the relief of all parts of the surface of a country upon a uniform series of maps by means of contours alone was an innovation; and it is a source of gratification to find that this plan, which has been fully set forth in preceding reports, is eminently successful.
The objections to the use of hachures and brtish shading are manifold: they obscure the map and conceal the conventions employed for the representation of other conditions and features of the surface; they easily degenerate into generalized conventions for imperfectly ascertained facts of relief, and thus fail to convey accurate information; they lead to the development of special artistic styles by the several draughtsmen employed upon the work, and thus do not have a uniform meaning from sheet to sheet; in districts of complex topography they are difficult of interpretation; and they represent reliefs only in a qualitative manner.
Another potent reason for the rejection of hachuring methods of representing topographic reliefs inheres in their excessive cost. The drawing and engraving of topography with hachures is many times more expensive than the drawing and engraving of the same in contours. In fact, hachure drawing and engraving almost equal in expense the field work by which the facts are collected. In the preparation of a map of a

6 REPORT OF THE DIRECTOR.
region so great as the United States- three million square miles in area, exclusive of Alaska questions of economy are of prime importance.
The method of hachuring has gained, and yet maintains, a strong hold among geographers because of its artistic capabilities; for by means of hachures alone, or in combination with either brush shading or contours, or both, it is possible to produce maps that have much artistic beauty and as forcibly express the artistic conceptions and individuality of their authors as do paintings and statuary. But therein lies the imperfection of the system; for in so far as the finished map expresses the individuality of the author, in just so far does it defeat the purpose for which it was designed, namely, the accurate representation of a portion of the earth's surface.
The cartographic conventions, i. e., the symbols to be used on the maps for the representation of the cultural, hydrographic, and hypsographic facts, have been reduced to the greatest possible simplicity, in order that the maps may be easily understood and be of value to all classes of people. As the cost of the Survey is borne by all the people of the United States, it was not deemed just that a map system should be adopted with a view to subserve the wants of trained engineers only. Still it is believed that while the system selected is so simple as to be easily used by all, it yet represents with precision and accuracy all the topographic facts desired by the engineer.
The maps already completed and engraved by the Survey include a great variety of topographic types, but all of these have been reduced to the uniform standard of cartographic representation adopted at the commencement of the work. The experience gained in the prosecution of the surveys upon which these maps are based and the preparation of the maps themselves demonstrate that the method of representing relief by contours not only enables the topographer to express the condition of the earth's surface quantitatively, but that within certain definite limits it permits the expression of artistic conceptions, and hence the production of maps which are highly

KEPOET OF THE DIRECTOR.

7

but not obtrusively artistic and at the same time strictly accurate.
The recognition and delineation of the features of the earth's surface by the topographers of the Survey has become a highly developed art, depending on experience and mechanic skill, the training and co-ordination of the eye and the hand, and the development of artistic perception of the reliefs diversifying the land. The value of the reliefs and the character of the topographic forms determined thereby vary from place to place, and the features of the surface are variously concealed by forests; and the methods of surveying in different localities are modified by the topography, the degree of concealment by forests, the facilities for travel and subsistence, and various other conditions. So the character of the special training of the topographer varies locally. Nevertheless, special work in any field is beneficial, and in a measure prepares the surveyor to enter upon other fields of work intelligently and promptly; and accordingly the retention of skilled topographers is found to be highly advantageous. Hence the changes in organization of this division of the Survey required from time to time, as the work is completed in certain areas and initiated in other areas, do not generally involve material changes in the personnel.
Under the statutes relating to the Geological Survey there is no provision for the general publication of purely topographic maps. These maps can be published only as a basis for "geological and economic maps illustrating the resources and classification of the lands," but a small edition is necessarily printed for the use of the employes and collaborators of the Survey in the prosecution of field work.
The demand for topographic maps has grown to great proportions, and it may be found advisable to ask the authority of Congress for their general distribution.
Although the topographers employed by the Survey are necessarily competent draughtsmen and usually construct their own maps, it has been found desirable, in order (1) to secure uniformity in style and character and (2) to obviate the necessity for employing the topographers in the office during months

8 EEPORT OF THE DIRECTOR.
in which they might more profitably be employed in the field, to organize a section of topographic drawing. In like manner, as set forth in an earlier report, the necessity for the adoption of uniform standards for the astronomic and geodetic work required in the co-ordination of the topographic surveys has led to the organization of an astronomic and computing section. Finally, it has been found economic, both in time and money, to establish a section in which are made the repairs of the large number of instruments constantly required by the division.
THE GEOLOGIC DIVISIONS.
It became necessary at the outset of geologic investigation to develop a system of taxonomy applicable to American rocks and a system of conventions whereby these rocks might be properly distinguished upon maps issued by the Survey and properly designated and defined in the accompanying letterpress. But there are difficulties in the way of developing such systems of taxonomy and graphic conventions. In the first place, there has grown up with geologic science a conventional language involving a taxonomy and a method of graphic representation which is based on the phenomena of other countries, and which is accordingly to some extent inapplicable to American rocks; it is nevertheless desirable to adhere as closely as possible to this conventional language because of its wide adoption. In the second place; it is manifest that a great portion of the rockmasses to be classified and represented on the maps have not yet been discovered. It has accordingly been necessary to devote much labor and thought to the development of a cartographic system which shall meet the following among^ other conditions: (1) it must be sufficiently definite to be readily intelligible to all users of the geologic maps published by the Survey, whether their interests lie in the scientific relations of the phenomena represented or in the economic resources of the areas mapped ; (2) it must be sufficiently elastic to yield to the requirements not only of the tentative classification of the rocks now in vogue but of such final classification as may be evolved after the extension of geologic operations over the whole country; and (3) it must be sufficiently com-

KEPOKT OF THE DIKECTOK.

prehensive to represent, without duplication of conventions and symbols, all rockmasses of the entire dominion of the United States which it may at any time become necessary to discriminate for scientific or economic reasons.
Pending the completion of a cartographic system suitable for present and future needs, geologic investigation of course has continued; and indeed the results of such investigation, as developed from time to time, have served an important purpose in determining the limitations and requirements of the cartographic system. Moreover, questions as to the taxonomic positions of the rockmasses discriminated in the field have arisen from time to time and will continue to arise in the future. The cartographic system devised to meet the various considerations involved must, therefore, be applied from time to time, as research progresses; and the rockmasses discriminated by each geologist in the field have to be correlated with those discriminated by every other geologist, and the entire sum of observations has to be combined and built up into a single comprehensive and symmetric system. To this end exhaustive study of the current and antecedent literature of American geology and occasional field investigations in critical areas are required.
The general work of systemization and co-ordination is the legitimate function of the administrative head of the Survey, but the amount of detailed labor involved has proved so great that it has become necessary to obtain the aid of one of the assistants of the Survey ; and for this purpose a portion of Mr. W J McGee's time during the past year has been given to the collection of the data to be used in this work.
The Geological Survey inherited much unfinished work of different surveys in the Western Territories previously, prosecuted under the auspices of the Government. Since it seemed desirable to carry forward and complete these surveys as rapidly as possible, investigations were continued in the fields covered by them, and thus the early organization of the Survey was determined in part by antecedent geologic work. At the same time, however, demands for local geologic and mineralogic investigations came from various portions of the country, including the older and long settled States, and as soon as the

10 REPORT OF THE DIRECTOR. *
legality of such action was established the geologic operations of the Survey were extended into the older States, and a number of divisions were organized and intrusted with the investigations.
It should be explained that by its organic law the Geological Survey is inhibited, both implicitly and directly, from making a geologic survey upon a cadastral plan, i. e., from making investigations relating to the value of properties of individuals. Accordingly, its workin economic geology is limited to the observation and mapping of the formations within which mineral resources lie; the general distribution and characteristics of coal beds, ore bodies, and other valuable mineral deposits; and the investigation of questions relating to the origin and taxonomic relations of the formations themselves and of their contained minerals.
Within the above limitation it has been found possible to make the scientific investigations of the Survey of high economic value, (1) by extending its operations into those portions of the different States in which the natural resources have not yet been fully developed, and (2) by developing and applying such systems of classification of the formations as will at the same time enable and compel the geologist to discriminate in the field and clearly distinguish on the maps of the Survey those rockmasses which are economically important. Both of these means of rendering these investigations of the Survey of maximum value to the country have been adopted. Moreover, friendly relations exist between the United States Geological Survey and the geologic surveys prosecuted under the auspices of different States of the Union; and in many cases partial co-operation with these States has been effected in such manner that the State geologists leave to the Federal Survey the investigation of such general scientific questions as involve operations beyond the limits of their own States as well as within them and avail themselves of the results of this investigation, and in return permit the general Survey to utilize the results of their own more strictly economic studies.
Many of the investigations undertaken within the public domain are purely economic in character, and all give promise

EEPOET OF THE DIRECTOR.

11

of results of economic importance either immediately through the discovery and development of natural resources, or remotely through the additional knowledge gained from "them as to the modes of origin and laws of distribution of ore deposits, the relations between geologic structure arid agricultural capabilities, &c.
For various requirements a number of distinct geologic divisions have been organized, and the occasion for each is demonstrated in the work which it has accomplished.

THE ACCESSORY DIVISIONS.

Ever since the birth of geologic science the importance of the fossils found in the rocks as a guide to geologic classification has been recognized; indeed, a large proportion of the questions which the geologist is called upon to answer cannot be answered without their aid, and paleontology, therefore, is now, as it ever has been, an essential part of geologic science. But geology is differentiated into many departments, and its progress has been along many lines; a large fund of special knowledge is required of the student in each; and the literature in each has become voluminous. Accordingly, it is no longer possible for the geologist, whose function it is to study the relations of the rocks themselves, to adequately investigate the relations of the fossils contained in these rocks. Division of labor is required: the geologist investigates the rocks and ascertains their physical characteristics and relations to contiguous rockmasses; while the paleontologist, studying the fossils collected from the same rocks by the geologist, determines the relations of these rocks to rockmasses in all parts of the earth. To meet this imperative demand for paleontologic investigation a number of divisions have been created ; and although paleontology is but a subordinate branch of geologic science, and the results of paleontologic investigation are hence but means to an end, the publications growing out of the work in these divisions are among the most valuable contributions to science already published or to be published in the near future by the Survey.

12 KEPOKT OF THE DIRECTOR.
Another class of criteria for determining1 the relations of rocks is found in their chemic constitution. Most of the questions concerned in geologic technology or in the application of geologic science to the arts involve a knowledge of the chemic constitution of rocks; and in addition requests for the chemic examination of various rocks, minerals, ores, soils, waters, gases, and natural oils, required for the proper prosecution of important public works, reach the Survey from time to time. To meet these various demands, a division of chemistry was early organized by the Survey, as specified in previous reports. There is connected therewith a physicaljaboratory, in which are prosecuted researches relating to the effects of temperature, pressure, moisture, &c., upon rocks, and the causal conditions of crystallization, segregation, and secondary alterations of various kinds such as have during the geologic ages' resulted in the formation of mineral veins, the metamorphism of rocks, &c.
A third class of criteria valuable in ascertaining the interrelations of rockmasses and the presence, therein of economically valuable minerals is found in their minute structure, discoverable only with the aid of the microscope; and in this and other countries microscopic petrography has rapidly grown to be one of the most important and promising lines of geologic research. The microscopic examination of rocks, however, involves cutting, grinding, and mounting of slides by means of delicate and costly machinery, and in some cases the separation of the rock constituents by means of fluids of variable specific gravity. This work, as well as the examination of the material thus prepared, requires skill of a high order and the permanent employment of the specialists intrusted with the work. In pursuance of its general policy of utilizing the latest discoveries in science and art whereby geologic investigation may be promoted, a petrographic laboratory has been organized in which all work of this character is done.
To meet the constant demand for information respecting1 the economic and industrial results of geologic investigation and the development of the mineral resources of the country,

REPORT OF THE DIRECTOR.

13

a division of mining statistics and technology has been established, as set forth in a previous report.
Some of the most important questions of the day, from both a scientific and an economic standpoint, are those involved in the relations of the soils and vegetation of the earth to the rocks which they conceal and from which the one is derived and by which the other is supported. Moreover, the distribution of the forests of this country is one of great and ever increasing importance to its people. Now, in the prosecution of the topographic surveys there is incidentally collected a vast amount of information relating to the forests of the different States in the Union which can be rendered available at small expense; and, in obedience to the statute relating thereto, there has been established a division of forestry, the functions of which are the collection and diffusion of data relating to the forests of the country, their extent and value, their proximity to routes of transportation, and our national resources in timber, lumber, ornamental woods, fuel, tan bark, and the various other forest products.
A division of illustrations has been established, and was described in a preceding report from this Office.
The tools of the field geologist are the hammer, trowel, compass, clinometer, and. magnifying glass; but the no less essential tools of the same geologist when employed in elaborating the results of his field studies are books; for no original investigator regards his work as complete until he has ascertained the results of researches in the same or related fields by all other investigators. Thus a library is a necessary part of the equipment of the working geologist. The literature of the science has become so voluminous that the purchase and maintenance of an adequate library by the individual geologist is a burden too great to be borne unless his means are ample, and students are compelled to avail themselves of extensive public libraries. It has been found economic of time, labor, and money to build up a carefully selected library of such strictly geologic works as are required from time to time by the officers of the Survey. The library now contains no less than 17,255 books and 19,600 pamphlets, together with

14 REPORT OF THE DIRECTOR.
9,000 maps. These come from all parts of the world, as indicated by the fact that they are printed in no less than nineteen languages, and include not only current scientific publications of private and public institutions, but the most important serial publications and also nearly all the standard contributions to telluric science that have ever been published. It is maintained chiefly by exchanges.
Since the material sent out in exchange consists of the publications of the Survey, a division has been established whose functions are the care of the library and the distribution of publications. That the work of this division is very great may be readily inferred from the facts that the publications have already reached 41 in number and are issued in various editions, aggregating 225,900 copies, in large part distributed by the Survey; that the library now contains no less than 36,855 books and pamphlets, besides 9,000 maps, and that a vast correspondence is involved in the elaborate system of exchange.
SCHEDULE OF ORGANIZATION.
Although the organization of an institution devoted to original research can never be considered final, the present differentiation of labor in the Geological Survey may be regarded as definite and comparatively thorough. It is as follows:

During the year the general plan for the preparation and engraving of the topographic sheets constituting the general atlas contemplated by the Survey, which was fully described in the last annual report, has been fully tested and put in execution; and already there have been engraved 57 sheets. The geographic distribution of these sheets is shown graphically in Plate I; and their distribution by States, the area covered in each State and Territory, and the scales of the work are exhibited in the appended table:

GEOLOGIC WORK.

,

THE INVESTIGATION OF THE AKCHEAN KOCKS.

The rocks of the earth are divisible into three great classes: (1) the crystalline or azoic masses (often denominated Archean), which form the base of the geologic column and are destitute of fossils and are generally without traces of organic life; (2) the clastic or fragmentary strata, which constitute the greater part of the geologic column and represent nearly the whole of that portion of the history of the earth with which geologists have become familiar, and which generally contain the remains of animal and vegetal organisms by which they may be classified; and (3) the volcanic rocks, which have been erupted at various stages of the world's history and are intercalated in various parts of the geologic column.
The great mineral wealth contained in the first of these systems of rocks renders their study one of the most important in the whole field of economic geology. Moreover, they represent one of the most interesting and at the same time obscure stages in the geologic development of the globe; but, by reason of their general concealment beneath newer rocks, as well as by reason of the absence of fossils and the dearth of other criteria for their genetic and chronologic classification, the relations of these rocks to one another, to the clastic and
7 GEOL 2

18 REPORT OF THE DIRECTOR.
volcanic series, and to their contained minerals, are little un' derstood. There are even grave doubts whether the best methods of investigating these rockmasses and the best criteria for their classification have yet been developed. The Archean rocks, therefore, offer one of the most promising subjects for geologic study in this and other countries; and it was imperative, in view of both its scientific and its economic aspects,, that such investigations should be commenced in this field as will result not only in the discovery and classification of phenomena, but in the general advancement of our knowledge of the principles involved in this branch of geologic science.
The investigations in Archean geology of the eastern portion of the United States were intrusted to Prof. Raphael Pumpelly. The character of his studies, his preliminary results, and the 'state of his work are indicated in his administrative report submitted herewith.; and one of the first fruits of his survey, growing out of one of its collateral branches, is a, memoir by Prof. W. M. Davis, one of his assistants, on the Triassic sandstones and traps of the Connecticut Valley, which constitutes one of the papers accompanying this report.
THE SURVEYS OF THE ATLANTIC COAST.
It is estimated that there are 100,000 square miles of coastal lands in this country which, subject to inundation by tidal and fluviatile waters, are valueless in their present condition. It would appear, from the experience of other countries, that by the employment of proper methods these lands might be reclaimed and rendered among the most valuable of the agricultural lands of the United States. But the relative altitude of land and sea is not constant: in some places the ocean is encroaching Upon the land, and elsewhere the land is emerging from beneath the oceanic waters; and even where the level of the coastal lands is stationary, the shores are undermined and eaten away by the waves, and thus the sea gains upon the land in another way. Now it would be unwise to inaugurate expensive systems of replamation of inundated lands without first ascertaining whether these lands are undergoing move-

KEPORT OF THE DIRECTOR.

19

ment, and if so in what direction; and, in order to guide engineering operations directed to such reclamation, a general investigation of the changes in level now in progress along the Atlantic coast has been undertaken.
Connected, with these questions of oscillation of the land and the formation of coastal marshes is that relating to the origin and distribution of the bog ores, phosphatic beds, &c., now in process of formation in the marshes of the Atlantic coast,, and, imbedded in the Cenozoic formations thereof, constituting one of the most important of the mineral resources of the Atlantic States.
These subjects of investigation and others of related character have been placed in the hands of Prof. N. S. Shaler. His preliminary results will be found elsewhere in this volume.

THE SURVEYS OF THE APPALACHIAN REGION.
By reason of its vast extent, its symmetry of structure, and the economic importance of the minerals contained in its rocks, the Appalachian mountain system has long been regarded as one of the most promising fields for geologic study to be found in any country. The publication of an elaborate treatise growing out of the investigations prosecuted under State auspices in Pennsylvania by H. D. Rogers, nearly thirty years ago, directed the attention of capitalists and scientific men to the portion of this field lying within that State, and the great development of the mineral resources of the Keystone State in the various forms of anthracite and bituminous coal, iron; petroleum, and natural gas must be attributed in large part to the stimulus afforded by these early scientific researches and the extensive publication of the results thereof; for the nearly commensurate mineral resources of Virginia, which were also investigated under State auspices about the same time by the equally eminent W. B. Rogers, the final results of whose researches were unfortunately never published, have remained to a great extent unknown.
The surveys instituted by the Geological Survey in the Appalachian region traverse the fields already occupied by the brothers Rogers and other geologists who have studied the re-

20 REPORT OF THE DIRECTOR.
gion, and in addition to their purely economic results these surveys promise to throw much light on various obscure questions in geology: e. g., the origin of the sediments of which a large portion of the rocks of the American continent are composed; the geographic configuration of the eastern portion of the American continent during different stages in its geologic development; the distribution of faunas and their modification by local conditions, and hence their value as bases for geologic classification ; the petrographic diversity of formations laid down within the same geographic province; the origin and mechanism .of mountain making movements and of continental oscillations; the metamorphism and other alterations of rocks produced by various causes; the genesis of coal and other carbonaceous minerals; and many other questions equally important in philosophic geology.
The economic results of these researches give equal promise. As will appear from the accompanying report of Mr. Gr. K. Gilbert, who has charge of the surveys in this region, two publications on subjects of economic importance have already grown out of the work and will shortly appear.
THE SURVEYS OP THE LAKE SUPERIOR REGION.
The copper-bearing rocks of the Lake Superior region (known among geologists as the Keweenaw Series) have been investigated in some detail by the State surveys of Michigan and Wisconsin; and the northward continuation of the same rocks has been examined by the officers of the Canadian Survey. But so long as geologists confined their attention to this single formation as an isolated congeries of phenomena, they were unable to ascertain its genetic and structural relations to the other formations of the country, and great confusion and uncertainty prevailed with respect to the copper-bearing series of rocks up to a very recent date.
When the operations of the Geological Survey were extended into the older States, Prof. R. D. Irving was employed to investigate these and associated rocks, not only within the limited area in which alone copper mines have been opened, but also in adjacent parts of Michigan, Wisconsin, and Minne-

REPORT OF THE DIRECTOR.

21

sota; and, as previous reports have shown, his studies have already extended over a considerable area and have been productive of valuable results. During the past year his surveys have extended into the sparsely settled or altogether unsettled regions in Northern and Northeastern Minnesota, in which the only routes of travel are rivers and lake's and the sole means of progression light canoes; and extensive foot trips in neighboring regions were made by his assistants. Surveys in» the Penokee-Gogebic region of Northern Wisconsin and Michigan were made for the purpose of supplementing and corroborating antecedent observations; the interesting succession of crystalline rocks about the western extremity of Lake Superior was examined in detail; and the notes of the last and previous field seasons have been assembled and digested, as set forth in the administrative report submitted herewith.
Professor Irving's studies in the Lake Superior region have led him to question the applicability of current systems of geologic taxonomy to that region without material modification. His views on this subject are clearly and forcibly expressed in a treatise constituting one of the accompanying papers of this report. These opinions, coming from such a source and representing as they do the outcome of years of study, carry with them great weight and are entitled to serious considera- ' tion.

THE INVESTIGATIONS IN GLACIAL GEOLOGY.

One of the ultimate purposes of the Geological Survey is the classification of the soils of the country with respect to their agricultural capabilities. As a necessary preliminary thereto, extended investigations of the superficial deposits constituting the subsoils have been undertaken; for the soil is simply derived from the subsoil through the action of the sun, rain, frost, the products of vegetal decay, and other agencies, and any classification of the soils involves the classification of the subsoils.' Experience in the various lines of geologic research has shown that the genetic classification of geologic products, involving as it does a thorough knowledge of the character thereof, is the only satisfactory one.

22 REPORT OF THE DIEECTOE.
This work, which was commenced shortly after the inauguration of the Survey, was intrusted to Prof. T. C. Chamberlin. Hitherto, Professor Chamberlin has been compelled by. practical considerations to confine his investigations to the glacial drift and its immediate derivatives; and since the immediate object of his studies was rather the discovery of the principles upon which soil classification may be based than the development of the classification itself, the results thus far attained have been scientific rather than economic. Some of these results have been published in earlier reports of the Geological Survey, and a treatise on one of the various phases of his multiform subject accompanies this report.
Professor Chamberlin's journey® and those of his assistants have already extended over a considerable portion of that northern third of the United States upon which the ice sheet deposited its burden of sand, clay, and bowlders. During the past year more or less extended observations have been made in Connecticut, Dakota, Idaho, Illinois, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Montana, Nebraska, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, West Virginia, and Wisconsin. Within this vast area they have not been confined to a single order of phenomena, but have included careful studies of the drift itself; of the lateral and terminal moraines into which it sometimes rises; of the aqueous and glacio-aqueous deposits into which it merges; of the kames and.drumlins locally developed within it in different regions; of the vegetal accumulations intercalated within its mass; of the rock surfaces upon which it rests, and the scoring, polishing, and striation of this surface, &c.: in short an attempt has been made to collate and thoroughly digest the entire range of widely diversified phenomena of the glacial drift and its derivatives.
Professor Chamberlin's work upon the glacial drift is the most comprehensive investigation of the class of phenomena involved ever undertaken in any country. It may now be regarded as approaching completion, and final reports upon different lines of the investigation will ^appear from time to time as the materials already collected are digested and elaborated.

THE SURVEYS IN MONTANA.
The mountain systems of the western part of the country are distinguished from those of the eastern portion by their greater irregularity and asymmetry, by their more recent origin, and in many other ways. Now, the structure of a mountain system is determined by its constituent rocks, and the first step in a comparative study of mountains is the determination of the age and structure of the rocks composing each ' of the systems compared. At the same time, the structure of the mountain system varies in a certain definite way from that of contiguous plains: the formations occupying vast areas in the plains are also represented in the mountains, where, by reason of their high inclination, they occupy small areas; the xformations which in the plains are destitute of valuable minerals when traced into the mountains sometimes become metalliferous, &c. Moreover, the great vertical scale of rock exposure in mountains facilitates geologic investigation there ; and so the succession of formations as developed in a single canon of a mountain range frequently affords a key to the .stratigraphy of a vast area of simple structure and plain topography.
With the foregoing considerations in view, investigations were undertaken, shortly after the establishment of .the Geological Survey, in a specially interesting portion of the Eocky Mountain region lying within Montana. The work was intrusted to Dr. F. V. Hayden. The detailed operations of this division of the Survey are set forth in an accompanying administrative report; but it is worthy of note here that this investigation, undertaken primarily for scientific purposes, has resulted in the discovery and tracing out through considerable areas of important beds of coal, and has also enabled the officers of the division to convey valuable information to citizens interested in different mining operations within the Territory.

THE RESEARCHES IN THE YELLOWSTONE NATIONAL PAKK.

Inquiries emanating from Congress and from different Departments of the Government from time to time have demon-

24 EEPOET OF THE DIRECTOR.
strated the desirability of ascertaining and making known to the public the character and attractions of this great National Park, in order that the purposes for which it was set aside may be fulfilled. Something is indeed known throughout the civilized world of its superb scenic features; the wonderful geysers and the unique mineral deposits resulting therefrom, the magnificent forests and the unique flora of this national preserve; but it is important that exact knowledge concerning this reservation for the use of the public set aside by a great nation should be disseminated among its people. Moreover, there are now in active operation within the National Park geologic agencies related in kind and degree to those which have been effective in the deposition of various minerals during different geologic periods. Nowhere else in the known world are the operations of nature's laboratory more thoroughly revealed ; and observations upon certain geologic processes here promise to add much to existing knowledge of ore deposition and kindred subjects.
This double object in thoroughly investigating the National Park led to the establishment of a division for this purpose some years ago. The division was placed in charge of Mr. Arnold Hague, and a portion of the results of his investigation have already appeared in different publications of the Survey.
During the past year Mr. Hague's researches have been prosecuted energetically, as indicated by his administrative report and by the appended memoir on Obsidian Cliff, by Mr. J. P. Iddings, one of his assistants.
As appears from Mr. Hague's report, a portion of the field season of 1885 was spent in conveying information to a Congressional committee which visited the park for the purpose of investigating its present condition and considering what legislation is needed for its future maintenance, and in assisting a special agent appointed by the honorable the Secretary of the Interior to examine and report upon the present management. of the park.
THE SURVEYS IN COLORADO.
One of the uncompleted investigations inherited by the Geological Survey was that of the extensive mining regions in

EEPOET OF THE DIKECTOK.

25

Colorado, and work in that wide field has been continued ever since.
As set forth in the administrative report of Mr. S. F. Emmons, the geologist in charge of the work of that division, different lines of study have been pursued during the past year. The region covered by the investigation is of exceedingly complex structure, and a great variety of rock formations as well as mineral deposits exist. The formations represent all portions of the geologic column, from the crystalline rockmasses of the Archean at the base, through the extensive series of the Paleozoics and the enormously developed Mesozoics, to the vast series of lacustral deposits laid down in the Rocky Mountain region during different epochs of the Cenozoic. Extensive fields and masses of eruptive rocks also occur, associated with the sedimentary and non-volcanic formations in various ways. The precious metals of the region are accumulated in and distributed through many different formations, while valuable beds of coal are found in both the Mesozoic and the Paleozoic strata. A thorough knowledge of the geologic structure of the entire region is accordingly essential to a satisfactory exposition of the mineral resources of the State. Moreover, here, as in the Rocky Mountain region of Montana, there are represented different types of orographic structure, the study of which is demanded on broad scientific grounds, and the stratigraphy displayed in the mountains affords a key to the structure of the great area of plain topography and rare rock-exposure lying to the eastward. The investigations within the region have accordingly been made along different lines, as Mr. Emmons's report indicates, but the various lines converge and the different objects of the investigation are attained from time to time. Publications comprehending a portion of these results will appear at an early day.

THE SUKVEYS IN CALIFORNIA.
The completion'of an important series of investigations during the present year by Mr. Greorge F., Becker is a source of gratification.
In 1883 Mr. Becker undertook the investigation of the quicksilver belt of Eastern California and Western Nevada. To a

26 REPORT OF THE DIRECTOR.
certain extent the field was a new one; for although geologists had given some attention to quicksilver deposits in Spain and other countries, the mode of occurrence and the petrographic relations of the mineral in California are in part unique. The investigation therefore extended not only to the quicksilver and immediately associated rocks, but also to the various associated formations and eventually included many questions relating to the influence of pressure, temperature, &c., upon rock metamorphism and mineral deposition; and among the results of the investigation must be numbered many important additions to previous knowledge of the principles of dynamic geology. These investigations, too, indicate very clearly the intimate interrelations between geology and the sister sciences, and demonstrate the importance of that broad and comprehensive study which it has ever been the aim of the Geological Survey to foster; for among the results of Mr. Seeker's researches must be enumerated the discovery of new and important laws in both physics and chemistry. As will appear from his report, however, the general and purely scientific problems investigated have, been subordinated to the primary purpose of the Survey, i. e., the discovery and the succinct exposition of the mode of occurrence and general distribution of the quicksilver deposits of the Pacific slope.
Mr. Seeker's energies are now concentrated upon a new field, the California gold belt. Preliminary studies of this belt were made some years ago by the then existing State Geological Survey of California, but these studies were never completed; and it is believed that further investigation will not only throw much light upon problems involved in the exploitation of the region and the development of its resources, but that they will at the same time direct attention to portions of the area which may be prospected with hope of success and prevent useless expenditure of time and money in hopeless prospecting in other portions.
THE RESEARCHES IN VOLCANIC GEOLOGY.
A single division of the Survey has been established for the purpose of investigating one of the three great classes of rocks

REPORT OF THE DIRECTOR.

27

described in an earlier paragraph, the eruptives or volcanic rocks. It has been placed in charge of C. E. Dutton, captain of ordnance, U. S. A., who has been detailed to this Office by the honorable the Secretary of War under authority of a specific statute. -
Volcanic rocks occur in all of the Western Territories, and, in less volume, in most of the older States. The lavas of which they are formed have been extravasated during various geologic periods; they have affected the different sedimentary formations with which they have been brought in contact in a great variety of ways; in certain portions of the country they are of vast thickness and areal extent; some of the precious metals and gerns occur within them; they are important elements in the orographic structure of many mountain systems; the extravasation of their materials is intimately connected with orogenic movements, and they are consequently involved in the taxonomy of mountains; and by their constitution they afford some insight into the condition of the interior of the earth. It is therefore important upon many grounds, both scientific and economic, that researches upon this class of rocks should be as thorough and profound as the knowledge and capabilities of man will permit.
As indicated in his report, Captain Button's journeys during the past fiscal year have extended over considerable areas in California and Oregon, and have led him to such notable but little known points as Mount Shasta, Lassen's Peak, and Crater Lake, and over considerable portions of the Cascade and Sierra Nevada ranges. Much of the territory traversed is little settled or even totally unexplored, and portions of it are desert; and his observations and those of his assistants, therefore, contribute to our knowledge of the geography as well as to our knowledge of the geology of an interesting portion of the country.

THE INVESTIGATIONS IN THE LOWER MISSISSIPPI REGION.
One of the most recently established of the divisions of the Survey is that which has for its object the investigation of the iron ores, the sulphur and salt deposits, and the various other

28 REPORT OF THE DIRECTOR.
mineral resources of the States of Mississippi, Louisiana, and Texas. It is in charge of Mr. Lawrence C. Johnson.
Mr. Johnson's efforts have been directed to the ascertainment of the geologic relations of the various beds yielding valuable minerals and the detailed structure of the entire region ; for in a region of such simple general structure as that of the Gulf States, it is possible to predicate the positions' and depths beneath the surface of formations containing mineral deposits with a good degree of accuracy, provided the relations between the mineral deposit and its country rock have been determined. It is a source of gratification to find that while Mr. Johnson's investigations have not yet reached such a stage of completeness as to warrant publication, he has been able to impart valuable general information to individuals interested in the material resources of the territory over which his operations have extended.
' THE INVESTIGATIONS ON THE POTOMAC RIVER.
When the Geological Survey was organized very little was known of the geologic structure. of the District of Columbia and contiguous portions of Maryland and Virginia; but as soon as possible after its organization geologic investigations were undertaken within this region, as has been mentioned in preceding reports. The work is in charge of Mr. W J McGree. During the past year his studies have covered a considerable area along the principal transportation routes between the north and south in Eastern Virginia and Maryland, and have also extended up the Potomac River well into the Appalachian region. Among the results reached in this division of the Survey may be mentioned the determination of the stratigraphy and general structure beneath the National Capital, and their bearing upon the question of water supply. Some information relating to this subject was communicated to the Health Officer of the District of Columbia during the year.
Just after the close of the fiscal year 1885-'86, and pending the completion of this report, Mr. McGree undertook an investigation of the geology of the region about the head of Chesapeake Bay for the purpose of ascertaining the probabilities

REPORT OF THE DIRECTOR.

29

of finding artesian water there. The area about the head of Chesapeake Bay is representative in geographic position and geologic structure of a zone upon which are located the cities of Trenton, Philadelphia, Wilmington, Baltimore, Washington, Alexandria, Fredericksburg, Richmond, Petersburg, Weldon, and others, in all of which the question of artesian water supply is important; and it was accordingly deemed wise to make the investigation as thorough as possible in order that its results might apply with only local modification to the various parts of this zone. Moreover, it seemed desirable that the investigation should be made public at the earliest possible day. Accordingly the requisite observations and studies were made as rapidly as possible and the report thereon is ready for publication as one of the general papers accompanying this report.

PALEONTOLOGIC WORK.
THE RESEARCHES IN VERTEBRATE PALEONTOLOGY.
It has been pointed out on a preceding page that paleontology furnishes the most important basis for general geologic classification and that paleontology is thus an essential part of geologic science. But one of the most important results of paleontologic research has been the development of the fact that the different classes of organic remains yield diverse units of geologic time. Thus, plants are little susceptible to the climatic and geographic changes that have occurred from time to time in the geologic history of the earth; modifications in vegetal organisms have consequently proceeded slowly; and hence the plant remains found in the rocks by their changes record great periods of time. The lower and less differentiated animal forms, the mollusca, radiata, &c., that.inhabit the ocean, yield more freely to conditions of environment, and are much less stable than, the plants; they have accordingly undergone greater and more rapid modification; and the chronologic units marked by these modifications are shorter. But the most sensitive geologic chronometer and that marking the shortest time units is afforded by the vertebrata, and especially by the more highly developed.land animals. Now

30 REPORT OF THE DIRECTOR.
in order to reduce the records of these different measures of geologic time and indices of taxonomic relations to a common standard, thorough investigation of the three great classes of fossils is demanded. Moreover, it frequently happens that formations containing plant remains are destitute of both vertebrate and invertebrate fossils; that beds yielding invertebrate fossils are without the remains of vertebrates or plants; and that great deposits characterized by vertebrate remains are destitute of the slightest traces of other, remains of life; and hence the determination of age and taxonomic relation depends now upon one, and again upon another, class of fossils. Thus different lines of paleontologic investigation have grown up in the Survey.
Among the rockmasses of the Western Territories, important by reason of their vast area and their immense thickness, there are many that were deposited in extensive lakes during late Mesozoic and Cenozoic time. These lakes were fed by great rivers; and within the sediment swept into these lakes there were preserved the bones of vertebrate animals that lived within the lacustral waters and upon the adjacent shores; and by means of comparative study of these bones the paleontologist is enabled to correlate the deposits laid down in different portions of the same lacustral area with each other and with the deposits of contemporaneous lakes, and at the same time to repro duce some of the most interesting scenes in the world's history. Prof. 0. C. Marsh has had charge of the investigation of these remains for some years, and has already made several contributions to our knowledge of extinct animal forms, and brought to light data of importance in the development of geologic taxonomy. During the past year his investigations have extended into different portions of Nebraska, Kansas, Wyoming, and Colorado; and much work has been done in investigating and classifying his extensive collections, together with those made by other divisions of the Survey, in the paleontologic laboratory in New Haven.
THE RESEARCHES IN PALEOZOIC INVERTEBRATE PALEONTOLOGY.
The organic remains useful in correlating and classifying the lower third of the fossiliferous series of rocks are pre-

dominantly those of. invertebrates, and accordingly this great class of fossils has been diligently studied, both in their biotic relations and in their relation to the strata within which they occur. This investigation is in charge of Mr. C. D. Walcott,. whose paleontologic laboratory is in the National Museum.
As will appear from Mr. Walcott's report, the investigations of the division during the past fiscal year, which were sometimes made in conjunction with the geologic parties of different divisions, have extended into Alabama, Georgia, Nevada, Tennessee, Utah, and various parts of New York;.and in addition there have been examined collections made by several geologists in other parts of the country. These studies have traversed the entire range of the Paleozoic groups, from the summit of the Carboniferous to the base of the Cambrian. Moreover, they have not been confined to the fossils themselves, but have in nearly all cases extended to the positions, of the fossils in the strata and the development of the stratigraphy of the regions in which they were found.
One of the most important of the conclusions reached by Mr. Walcott and his assistant, Prof. H. S. Williams, relates to the local modifications of animal life by environment and the shifting of faunas.from place to place with changing conditions in depth of water and configuration of shores, and consequent changes in sedimentation, in the Paleozoic ocean. These investigations are valuable in determining the limitations within which fossils are trustworthy criteria in the classification of rocks.

THE INVESTIGATION OF MESOZOIC INVERTEBRATE FOSSILS.

At its inception paleontology was little more than a set of empiric rules for the classification of formations by means of their, contained fossils, viewed as accidental or petrographic characters; but in the present stage of geologic science the value of paleontology to the stratigraphist, as well as to the student of historic geology, depends largely on the power which it gives of restoring and mentally picturing the geographic, topographic, climatic, and other conditions prevailing Jn the various parts of the globe during each geologic epoch.

32 REPORT OF THE DIRECTOR.
Studied in this broad way, fossils serve not only as data for the empiric correlation of the strata, but they enable the geologist properly to weigh and, in many cases, properly to interpret their own testimony, and thus mutually adjust the different time units of the three great classes of organic remains. It is with this view of the purposes of paleontologic investigation that researches by Dr. C. A. White have been made on the invertebrate fossils of the Mesozoic system of rocks in the United States.
During the past year Dr. White has performed field work in Utah, Wyoming, and Colorado, and has investigated collections from various parts of the country. One of the most important results of his field studies was the recognition of several distinct coal horizons within different early Tertiary and later Mesozoic formations. Another important result was the discovery of a large number of fresh water invertebrate remains associated with vertebrate fossils, which has added much to our previous knowledge of the continental invertebrate fauna of North America during Mesozoic time, and thus has been gained another vantage point from which insight may be obtained into the stratigraphic succession in the Rocky Mountain region and into the geologic history of the continent.
THE STUDY OF CENOZOIC INVERTEBRATE FOSSILS.
Fringing the Atlantic and G-ulf coasts of the United States there is a broad zone of fragmental deposits, constituting the upper part of the fossiliferous column as represented in the American continent: the Cenozoic system of rocks. These deposits comprise a number of distinct formations representing . different geologic periods. Within them are found the extensive greensand and phosphate deposits, which constitute the most important source of natural fertilizers in this country and which are thus far only partially developed. In the same formations there occur vast accumulations of iron ore, .and some of the formations contain deposits of sulphur, salt, and other valuable minerals. Geologic investigation has already commenced within the portion of this zone covered by the operations of the Mississippi Division of Geology; but it is irn-

EEPOET OP THE DIEECTOE.

33

portant that before extended geologic investigations are carried into this field a general study of its representative fossils shall be made, in order to facilitate prompt and trustworthy classification of the strata upon paleontologic grounds. This general investigation has been commenced by Mr. W. H. Ball. The details of his work in the important field to which he has been assigned, together with his collateral and accessory labors, are fully set forth in his administrative report.

THE EESEAECHES IN PALEOBOTANY.
Although plant 'impressions were among the first fossils to stimulate popular curiosity and attract scientific investigation they were among the latest to acquire importance as criteria for the classification of the rocks in which they occur. Their utility for such purposes is now generally recognized; and a division for their investigation has been established in the Geological Survey, and Mr. Lester F. Ward, whose extensive col lections and laboratory are in the National Museum, is in charge of it.
In this, as in the other lines of paleontologic investigations pursued by the Survey, the primary object of study is not alone empirically to classify fossiliferous formations by means of their contained fossils in accordance with existing knowledge, but rather to develop the fundamental principles involved -in the relations of rocks and fossils ; and this necessitates a knowledge of the organisms fossilized, of the manner in which the fossils became imbedded, and of the various circumstances and conditions attending these processes. Thus the value of plants as indices of geologic vicissitude must be ascertained before their reliability as bases for a comprehensive geologic taxonomy can be determined. Accordingly, as sufficiently indicated by his report, Professor Ward's studies have thus far been general and philosophic, and his results are contributions to the science of paleobotany rather than applications of the science to geologic technology.
The investigations of the geologists of the last generation, during which there was great activity in geologic work in the Eastern United States, have shown that there is an important hiatus in the geologic column as represented in the Appalachian
7 GEOL 3

34 REPORT OF THE DIRECTOR.
Mountains and along the Atlantic coast. This hiatus occurs about the place of the lower and middle portions of the Mesozoic system of rocks ; and it is impossible to form definite conceptions as to the succession of events in the geologic development of the continent until this gap is filled. Fortunatelysome epochs of the periods generally unrepresented in Eastern America are sometimes represented locally by stratigraphically and geographically unimportant formations. One such formation is the Trias of 'Connecticut, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Maryland, and portions of Virginia; another is the probably distinct series of deposits of Southeastern Virginia, by some geologists regarded as the American equivalent of the European Rhsetic; and a third is the formation intercalated between the Piedmont crystallines and the known Cretaceous rocks of the Atlantic slope, which probably belongs to a late Jurassic or early Cretaceous period unrepresented elsewhere in America, to which the name " Potomac formation " has been applied. The last two formations are practically destitute of animal remains, but each yields abundant traces of a unique and luxuriant flora; and with the hope of completing the geologic history of the American continent, the floras of these formations have been critically investigated in the division of paleobotany by Prof. William M. Fontaine.
Professor Fontaine's labors have already resulted in the preparation and publication of a monograph treating of the flora yielded by the older Mesozoic of Virginia; and, as set forth in his administrative report, his attention during the past year has been concentrated upon the equally interesting and yet more abundant flora of the Potomac formation of Virginia and contiguous portions of Maryland. His collections have been very large, and the material brought together will unquestionably add much to our knowledge of obscure points in American geology.
THE RESEARCHES IN FOSSIL INSECTS.
In accordance with the general theory held by the Survey, that collateral investigations ought to be simultaneously carried forward along as many convergent lines as possible, a.

study of the fossil insects found in the Paleozoic and Mesozoic rocks in different parts of the country has been instituted. The investigation has been put in the hands of Mr. S. H. Scudder, the eminent specialist to whom the world is indebted for an important share of existing knowledge of the insect faunas of past ages. It is especially important that the study of fossil insects should be prosecuted in connection with that of fossil plants; for, as shown by the most eminent biologists, the history of plant life has been intimately connected with that of insect life; many of the most important modifications in plants are..directly attributable to the agency of insects; and thus insects are as reliable indices of climatic and other conditions that have prevailed during the various geologic epochs as the plants themselves. Moreover, insects, like plants, tell of terrestrial conditions, while a large share of the other fossil remains that have been subjected to examination tell only of the sea and of aqueous conditions; and it is as important to geologists, whatever be the ultimate aim of their researches, to understand the various stages in the development of the land as to interpret the history of the seas.
Professor Scudder's brief report on the initial work of his division appears in its proper place.

MISCELLANEOUS.
. WOEK IN THE DIVISION OP CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS.
As will appear from the report of Prof. F. W. Clarke, chief of this division, satisfactory progress has been made in the analyses of rocks, ores, mineral waters, &c. These analyses cover materials from Arizona, California, Colorado, Illinois, Iowa, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine, Massachusetts, Michigan, Montana, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, .Utah, Virginia, West Virginia, Wyoming, Yellowstone Park, and several States and Territories not named above.
While the chemic work of the Survey is ever regarded as subordinate to geologic investigation and its character and specific objects are determined from time to time by the needs

_36 REPORT OF THE DIRECTOR.
of the geologists of the Survey, original investigation in different collateral lines is encouraged, it is believed with beneficial results. Thus, during the past year interesting questions relating to the genesis of certain minerals and to the agency of certain waters in forming minerals have been investigated in this division of the Survey. Many of the researches carried on in this division have a direct practical bearing upon questions connected with the development of the mineral resources of the country. Among these may be mentioned the investigation of methods of salt manufacture by Mr. T. M. Chatard, submitted herewith among the special treatises prepared to accompany this report.
Hitherto the geologist engaged in the discussion of problems involving coefficients of friction, moduli of elasticity, constants expressing the effects of pressure, temperature, &c., upon rocks, and other questions such as continually arise in dynamic geology has generally been compelled to confine himself to the use of constants determined in connection with the arts; but such constants are unsatisfactory, since they are applicable only to a much more limited range of conditions than those encountered by the dynamic geologist. Accordingly, an adequate discussion of such phenomena demands more accurate determination of constants applicable under a wide range of conditions; and this involves the improvement of methods of determination and the devising of special apparatus therefor. These are the ends kept in view by Dr. C. Barus and his associates, the physicists of the division, and satisfactory progress has been made in their attainment.
RESEARCHES ON SEA LEVEL AS AFFECTED BY THE ATTRACTION OF ADVENTITIOUS MASSES.
The principal function of the astronomic and computing section and that which it was specifically established to perform is the making and reduction of such astronomic and geodetic observations as are required in the accurate determination of points lying within the areas topographically surveyed and in the co-ordination of the topographic sheets. Much work of this character has been performed in a satisfactory manner during the past year, and a special report thereon will

shortly be issued. But there arise from time to time important questions in physics and pure geology whose discussion involves the application of the higher mathematics, and the geologists are assisted in the investigation of such subjects by the astronomer of the Survey, Mr. K S. Woodward.
One of the fields of original investigation inherited by this Survey and greatly expanded through its efforts relates to the ancient beaches and shore terraces that have been discovered and traced out in different parts of the country, far from the present shore lines. In many cases these ancient water lines are not horizontal. Now, it is important, upon purely scientific grounds as well as for utilitarian purposes, to ascertain the causes and the limits of the shifting of the great water bodies of the earth that these records indicate. It is also important that the different hypotheses which have been entertained from time to time as to the nature of this shifting should be tested by comparison with known facts. Among these hypotheses is that which attributes the shifting of the shore lines to the deformation of the sea level of the glacial period arising from the attraction of the northern ice sheet. The amount of deformation producible in the terrestrial spheroid by the attraction of a given ice mass is susceptible of determination to any required degree of precision by mathematic methods; but, in order to eliminate the possibility of error from the formulas of different investigators who have at various times dealt with related questions and to render practicable the numeric evaluation of the disturbing effects of local masses (either forming a part of the earth or superimposed upon its surface) on the sea level, it was necessary that the entire subject of the gravitative action of such masses should be critically reviewed. Such a review has been undertaken by Mr. Woodward during the past year, with valuable results. He has derived a new set of formulas, applicable not only to the discussion of the specific questions for which they were designed but to the entire class of questions to which these belong. Thus, the same formulas are of value in determining the relative positions of level (equipotential) surfaces in lake basins; they are applicable in determining the deformation of the ocean surface by contiguous continents;

38 REPORT OF THE DIRECTOR.
within certain limits they are applicable in determining the relative density of different mountain ranges, or of mountain ranges and contiguous plains; and they are also applicable in discussions relating to the distribution of density in the earth's crust and other important problems in geology.
The results of Mr. Woodward's investigations will be published at an early day.

WORK IN THE DIVISION OF MINING STATISTICS AND TECHNOLOGY.

The principal function of the Geological Survey is the discovery of mineral resources before unknown and the collection of facts of importance to the industries involved. In order that this function may be properly performed it is necessary that attention shall be given to the technology of mining and that information relating to the best methods of mining different ores under various conditions shall be disseminated. Moreover, statistics of mining operations and of mineral products are essential to a thorough comprehension of the great mineral resources of the country, the mineral interests involved therein, and the industries that grow out of them. A division has been established for the performance of this work. The scope and character of the work of the division are clearly set forth in Mr. Albert Williams's final administrative report. The division is now in charge of Dr. D. T. Day.

WORK IN FORESTRY.

It is well known that the pineries of the Upper Mississippi and Great Lake regions, from which a large proportion of the lumber consumed in the country has been derived during past decades, are rapidly disappearing and that their complete ex-

40 REPORT OF THE DIRECTOR.
haustion is a question of only a few years. It is therefore important that the eyes of the lumber manufacturer and of the lumber consumer should be directed to other regions of supply. Among such are the wooded portions of the Appalachian mountain system, the Adirondack region in New York, and other considerable areas in the Eastern United States which are naturally forested with woods available in the manufacture of various grades of lumber and within which the land is comparatively worthless for other purposes than timber growth. But the American people have now passed that pioneer stage in the settlement and utilization of the national domain in which man can avail himself of the fruits of the land without thought for the morrow. The time has come for considering questions of reproduction of ephemeral products and of perpetuating the natural supplies thereof. Moreover, the interests growing out of the various products of the soil are intimately but intricately connected with various other interests. It is'therefore important not only to ascertain and classify the present forest resources of the country, but also to determine (1) what portions of the country can be profitably reserved for arboriculture and (2) what kinds of trees are best adapted toeach region.
Such is the work of'the division of forestry. In the administrative report of the chief of that division, Mr. George W. Shutt, the plan of operations and the preliminary results already secured are set forth in detail.
SUPERVISION OF PUBLICATION.
As stated on a previous page, the publications of the Survey already numbered 41 at the beginning of the fiscal year. Adding to this the number of monographs, bulletins, annual reports, and statistical papers since published or in various stages of completion, the total number is brought up to 58 at the present time. These publications, emanating from the several scientific divisions of the Survey, are varied in scope and frequently of a highly technical character. To secure clear and accurate statement in the material sent to press,. careful proof-reading, and uniformity in the details of book-

making, as well as to assist the Director in exercising a general ' supervision over the publications of the Survey, it has been found expedient to provide a small corps to which work of this character may be intrusted; and Mr. Thomas Hampson has been placed in charge of it.

WORK IN THE DIVISION OF ILLUSTRATIONS AND IN THE DIVISION OF THE LIBRARY AND DOCUMENTS.
Attention is directed to the reports of the chiefs of these divisions, in which the operations for the past fiscal year are set forth in detail.

OFFICE OF THE SURVEY.

During the year the Survey offices, with the exception of the paleontologic and chemic laboratories, have remained in the F street building rented by the Government for the purpose ; and it has been found that the transaction of business has been greatly facilitated by reason of the satisfactory arrangement of rooms, &c., in this commodious building. Most of the laboratories remain in the National Museum. The laboratory of vertebrate paleontology has been retained at New Haven, in one of the buildings of Yale College, for lack of space in the National Museum; and the offices 'knd chemic laboratories of the Colorado and California divisions of geology are retained respectively in Denver and in San Francisco.

ACKNOWLEDGMENTS.
It is a pleasure to report that the relations of the various members of the Survey among themselves and with the Director have been most harmonious, and that there has been a complete co-operation between the several divisions. The Director desires to express his deep gratitude to the different gentlemen employed under his direction, who have so fully appreciated the ends of the Survey and so energetically carried out the plans whereby it is hoped these ends may be attained.
As heretofore, the Survey is deeply indebted to the honorable Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution, Prof Spencer

42 REPORT OF THE DIRECTOR.
F. Baird, for the use of laboratory rooms in the National Museum and for the care and proper exhibition of the voluminous collections sent in from all parts of the country.
To the railroads of the United States the Survey is profoundly indebted not only for free transportation, whereby its work in some cases has been greatly facilitated, but for plans, profiles, and other valuable results of their surveys. Such data, have been of incalculable service in the prosecution of the topographic surveys of this institution, as has been indicated in a pre ceding report.

DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR, U. S. GEOLOGICAL SURYEY, DIVISION OF GEOGRAPHY,
Washington, D. G., July 1, 1886.
SIR : I have the honor to submit the following report of the operations of the Division of Geography during the fiscal year ending June 30,1886:
During the year geographic work was carried oii in all the areas occupied during the preceding year, including Massachusetts, New Jersey, the Appalachian Mountains south of Mason and Dixon's line, Kansas, Missouri, Texas, Arizona, the Cascade Range in Northern California and Southern Oregon, and in the Yellowstoue National Park. Furthermore, work was begun, upon a scale of 1 mile to an inch, in the area adjoining the District of Colnmbia, and, upon a publication scale of 2 miles to an inch, in the Gold Belt, upon the western slope of the Sierra Nevada, in California. The total area surveyed during the season is 81j829 square miles,1 distributed as follows among the various areas under survey:

The average cost of the work done during the year was, approximately,. $2.75 per square mile.
There were completed during the year no fewer than ninety sheets of the General Topographic Atlas, several of which, "although surveyed only last summer, are already engraved, while many others are in the hands of the engraver.
ORGANIZATION.
The organization of the division was very similar to that during the preceding year. The work in Massachusetts and New Jersey, constituting the northeastern section, was until recently under my immediate supervision. On the 19th of April, 1886, Mr. Marcus Baker, formerly an assistant in the United States Coast and Geodetic Survey, was appointed geographer, and shortly afterward was assigned to the charge of the northeastern section.
All work done in the country south of Mason and Dixon's line and the Ohio Eiver and east of the Mississippi, constituting the Appalachian section, was as heretofore in charge of Mr. Gilbert Thompson.
The work west of the Mississippi Eiver (with the exception of that done in the Yellowstone National Park), including the Missouri-Kansas, Texas, Arizona, Gold Belt, and Cascade subsections, was in charge of Prof. A. H. Thompson.
The work done in the Yellowstone National Park and the region immediately adjacent thereto constituted a separate section, in charge of Mr. John H. Eenshawe.
In the office there was a section of drawing, in charge of Mr. HarryKing, and there was a section for the manufacture and repair of instruments, in charge of Mr. Edward Kiibel.
NORTHEASTERN SECTION.
Massachusetts subsection.— The opening of the fiscal year found Mr^ Sumner H. Bodfish, with Messrs. C. C. Bassett, E. H. Phillips, Laurence Thompson, Clifford Arrick, E. B. Clark, W. J. Grambs, H. L. Smyth, and Van H. Manning, jr., at work in Bristol County, in the southeastern part of the State. Mr. Bassett was subsequently detailed to Mr. Johnson's party, and two additional assistants were added to Mr. Bodfish'a party, making altogether ten men under his orders. These men prosecuted work during the season in Plymouth and Bristol Counties, and with such good effect that by the end of the season the area of these two counties was surveyed, with the exception of parts of the towns of Plymouth and "Wareham, in the southeastern part of Plymouth County. There remained to be completed, however, in various parts of the region, small areas of swamp, marsh, ponds, &c., which could be surveyed to advantage during the winter, when frozen, and for this purpose two or three of the members of the party were left in the field during the winter, while the rest returned to Washington early in December. During the winter and early spring these swamp areas were sur-
