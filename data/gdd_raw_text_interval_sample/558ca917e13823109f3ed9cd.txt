INTRODUCTION
The Caballo Resource Area is a Bureau of Land Management (BLM) designated region that includes all of Sierra and Otero Counties, south-central New Mexico. Within this resource area of more than 21,000 square miles, nearly one fourth of the land is administered by the BLM. At the request of the BLM, geological and geochemical investigations were carried out at the Three Rivers Petroglyph Site and surrounding area, approximately 32 miles north of Alamagordo, New Mexico in northeastern Otero County (Fig. 1).
The BLM-administered Petroglyph Site contains more than 21,000 examples of rock art carved by Mogollon Indians between about 900 and 1200 A.D. The Site occupies about five square miles of land along Three Rivers, whose tributaries drain the western slopes of Sierra Blanca. This report discusses the geology of the Petroglyph Site and the mineral resources and environmental geochemistry of the Petroglyph Site and surrounding area.
GEOLOGY Regional Setting
The Three Rivers area is located in the northeastern part of the Tularosa basin and lies within the Sacramento section of the Basin and Range physiographic province of Fenneman (1931). The study area is located near the eastern margin of the Rio Grande Rift; major riftmargin faults occur less than three miles west of the study area (Woodward and others, 1975). The Three Rivers area is located within a north-trending zone of Tertiary intrusive rocks that includes some of New Mexico's most important gold deposits. The intrusions and related volcanic rocks are alkalic in composition and the associated deposits contain both precious and base metals.
Sierra Blanca is a prominent peak east of the study area and marks the northern-most extent of the adjacent Sacramento Mountains. The nearly 12,000-foot-high Sierra Blanca is drained on its western flank by Three, Indian, and Golondrinas Creeks that comprise the headwaters of Three Rivers. The peak is underlain by numerous alkalic plutonic stocks and related volcanic rocks of Tertiary age (Moore and others, 1988; Seagerstrom and others, 1979; Thompson, 1972). Most of the upper Three Rivers drainage basin is underlain by the midTertiary Walker Andesite Breccia (Seagerstrom and others, 1979). The Godfrey Hills which lie less than two miles northwest of the Petroglyph Site are also composed of the Walker Andesite that is overlain by the Godfrey Hills Trachyte of Thompson (1972). Black Mountain on the southwest flank of Sierra Blanca and directly east-southeast of the Petroglyph Site is underlain by igneous rocks that consist of hornblende syenite, quartz syenite, and numerous dikes of alkali gabbro and syenogabbro (Moore and others, 1988). Sedimentary rocks of Permian and Cretaceous age were intruded by igneous rocks of the Sierra Blanca region.
The area surrounding the Petroglyph Site is one of low relief and consists of coalecing alluvial fans whose source is the Godfrey Hills and Black Mountain to the east. Three Rivers drainage basin is located between the Godfrey Hills and Black Mountain and the main channel of the river is within the Petroglyph Site. Indian rock art carvings are preserved along the crest of a northwest-trending ridge that is the main physiographic feature at the Site.

Geology of the Three River Petroglyph Site Most of the rock units within the boundaries of the Petroglyph Site consist of surficial
deposits (Fig. 2). Stream floodplain alluvium fills the active channel of Three Rivers and was also deposited in wide ephermal stream channels that drain the west side of the Godfrey Hills. Stream gravels that cap low terraces adjacent to Three Rivers represent older stream floodplain deposits. Alluvial and fluvial deposits ranging from silt to cobble gravel were deposited in narrow, anastomozing stream channels and on broad alluvial slopes. Thick deposits of caliche cap the higher parts of the petroglyph ridge and are characterized by white, calcareous deposits containing angular fragments of the underlying sill. Colluvium is well developed on most bedrock surfaces, is generally abundant in calcium carbonate, and is typically one to two feet thick; deposits labeled Qck (Fig. 2) overlie Cretaceous sedimentary rocks: those labled Qci overlie Tertiary intrusive rocks. Talus deposits derived mainly from igneous rocks that cap the petroglyph ridge cover much of the west side of the escarpment. Young alluvial fan deposits encircle the main ridge within the Petroglyph Site and overlie older, broad and now partly dissected alluvial fans shed from the nearby Godfrey Hills.
Sedimentary rocks exposed at the Petroglyph Site consist of the Cretaceous Mesa Verde Group. The Mesa Verde is poorly exposed within the boundaries of the study area; the best and most complete exposures are along the west side of the northwest-trending ridge (Fig. 2). The sedimentary rocks consist of an interlayered sequence of predominantly yellow-colored sandstone, siltstone, and shale. Sandstone ranges from olive-tan, platy, fine-grained lithic arenite interlayered with informational mud chip conglomerate to tan-white, medium-grained, crossbedded quartz arenite with calcium carbonate cement. Some sandstone beds contain abundant marine shell fragments. Shale and siltstone are typically yellow-brown, locally sandy and calcareous, and poorly exposed.
The main body of igneous rock within the Site underlies the elongate ridge that contains the prehistoric Indian petroglyphs. The rock is a dark green fine-grained trachybasalt that contains hornblende phenocrysts up to two inches long. A well developed patina of manganese oxide or desert varnish coats most exposed surfaces of the rock outcrops. The surface coating is easily scratched and provided prehistoric Indians an accessible medium upon which to make petroglyphs.
The main ridge is an elongated trachybasalt sill intruded into the Cretaceous sedimentary rocks. Maxium thickness of the sill is around 30 feet. The sill is associated with several smaller concordant to plug-like bodies intruded both above and below the main intrusive (Fig. 2). Baked sedimentary rocks at the contacts of the sills are common and extend no more than a few feet from the intusive contact. Quartz veins and evidence of hydrothermal alteration and mineralization associated with these intrusions were not observed. The sill is latest Eocene in age; 40Ar/39Ar age of the main sill, obtained during this study, is 36.32±0.35 million years.
KNOWN MINERAL RESOURCES OF THE REGION
Some of New Mexico's largest gold deposits occur along a north-south belt roughly along the boundary between the Great Plains physiographic margin, the Rio Grande rift on the south and Rocky Mountains physiographic province on the north (McLemore, 1996). These deposits

have similar characteristics that define a class of ore deposits referred to as Great Plains Margin deposits by North and McLemore (1986, 1988).
Great Plains Margin (GPM) deposits contain both precious and base metals, but precious metals, especially gold, are typically high compared to other metal deposits in the state. These deposits consist of six deposit types: (1) placer gold, (2) porphyry copper-gold (± molybdenum) and gold,(3) gold-silver and polymetallic veins and breccia deposits, (4) copper, lead/zinc, and/or gold skarns or carbonate-hosted replacement deposits, (5) iron skarns and replacement bodies, and (6) thorium-REE-fluorite epithermal veins and breccias. Mineralization is usually associated with silica-saturated (monzonite) or oversaturated (quartz monzonite) rocks of Eocene or Oligocene age (Segerstrom and Ryberg, 1974; McLemore and North, 1987; McLemore and others, 1991; Thompson, 1991). Lamprophyre dikes or sills are common in areas containing mineralized rocks, but their association to deposits is unknown.
Placer gold deposits Placer gold deposits are low grade, disseminated deposits consisting of small sized gold. In New Mexico, they generally occur in late Tertiary to Recent alluvial fan deposits, bench or terrace gravel deposits, river-bars, and stream deposits or as residual placers formed directly on top of lode deposits typically derived from Proterozoic, Cretaceous, and Tertiary source rocks (McLemore, 1994a). Gold also concentrates above cemented gravels and clay layers within the gravel deposits, which constrain downward migration of gold particles. Most deposits are thin and less than 45 ft below the surface (Lindgren and others, 1910; Johnson, 1972).
Copper-molybdenum-gold porphyry deposits Copper-gold and/or gold porphyries, locally with significant quatities of molybdenum (Cox and Singer, 1986, 20c, 2 la) are found in some GPM deposits in New Mexico. Disseminated molybdenum and copper minerals occur in the Rialto stock in Lincoln County, northeast of Three Rivers, but the low grades and proximity to a wilderness area has hampered development (Thompson, 1968). At the Mudpuppy-Waterdog prospect in the Nogal-Bonito mining district, northeast of Three Rivers, a copper-gold porphyry deposit is hosted by a syenite to monzonite stock that is concentrically zoned from outer propylitic to argillic to inner phyllic alteration to a core of silicified and oxidized breccia (Fulp and Woodward, 1991).
Alkaline-related gold-silver and polymetallic veins and breccia deposits Many polymetallic veins are associated with gold-bearing breccia deposits and quartz veins in many GPM districts (McLemore, 1996). Breccia fragments of igneous and/or sedimentary rock are typically highly altered and vary in size, ranging from large blocks 10's of feet in diameter to clay-sized particles. The origin of these breccia deposits is related to igneous intrusion and associated volcanism. Brecciation was followed by flooding of hydrothermal fluids forming cement of the breccia fragments and quartz veins that may carry base and precious metals..
Copper, lead-zinc, and gold skarns or carbonate-hosted replacements Numerous GPM districts host copper, lead-zinc, and gold skarn deposits in New Mexico (Cox and Singer, 1986,18a, b, c). Most skarns are copper skarns, but they contain considerable gold concentrations. Most gold skarns occur as carbonate-hosted deposits in Ordovician to Permian limestones (White, 1991; Giles, 1991). The skarns typically occur in metasomatized limestone adjacent to or in the vicinity of an intrusive contact with stocks, dikes, and/or sills.
Iron contact metasomatic-replacement and skarn deposits Numerous iron skarn and

replacement deposits (Cox and Singer, 1986, 18d) occur throughout the GPM alkaline igneous rock belt. Most deposits are small and insignificant (Griswold, 1959; Kelley, 1949) and none are economic gold deposits.
The iron deposits consist of hematite and magnetite and occur as lenses or irregular bodies in limestone and as veins filling fractures, faults, and along bedding planes adjacent to Tertiary intrusions. Calc-silicate minerals are rare.
Thorium-rare-earth elements-fluorite and niobium vein deposits Thorium-rare-earth elements-fluorite epithermal veins and breccias (Cox and Singer, 1986, lid) occur throughout the GPM area (McLemore, 1996). They typically occur as tabular bodies, narrow lenses, and breccia zones along fractures, faults, and shear zones and vary from a few feet to over 900 feet long and from less than an inch to 9 feet wide (Staatz, 1985, 1986; Perhac, 1970; McLemore and Phillips, 1991; McLemore and Guilinger, 1993; Schreiner, 1991, 1993). The deposits are typically spotty, discontinuous, of variable grade, and contain local concentrations of REE, yttrium, thorium, uranium, niobium, and gold (McLemore and others., 1988a,b). Bastnaesite was produced from the Gallinas district, north of Three Rivers (Griswold, 1959). Gold is typically low, rarely exceeding a few parts per million in concentration.
Three Rivers area The study area has probably been prospected for a variety of metals, but to date, no
known development or production has occurred. Alkaline igneous rocks are present in the vicintiy of the study area and, as discussed above, are known in New Mexico to have potential for deposits of gold and silver deposits. The closest mining took place in the Three Rivers district, several miles to the east. The Tularosa district, approximately 10 miles southeast of the study area, contained sandstone-hosted red-bed type copper mineralization. The production is not known but was probably small (Anderson, 1957).
Three Rivers mining district The Three Rivers mining district is one of several districts in the Sierra Blanca area. The
largest, most productive districts are located northeast of the Petroglyph Site in Lincoln County. The Three Rivers district extends to Black Mountain on the south to Three Rivers Canyon on the north in Lincoln County; the district includes much of the upper Three Rivers drainage basin. The Three Rivers Petroglyph Site lies about seven miles west of the mining district. Many of the mines and prospects are on the Mescalero Apache Indian reservation (Table 1). Three minor prospects are located near and within the southwestern portion of the White Mountian Wildereness Area. In 1943, H. Stain shipped 87 tons of 58 % Fe and 0.138 % P from deposits on the east side of Black Mountain in sec. 18, T12S, Rl IE (Harrer and Kelly, 1963; Kelley, 1949). Additional, but minor prospecting for replacement iron-copper and volcanic-epithermal vein deposits has occurred (Table 1). Production, if any, from these deposits is unknown.
Replacement iron deposits are the most important mineral deposits in the Three Rivers district. The largest known replacement iron deposit is in sec. 18T12S,R11E, where magnetite and hematite with barite, azurite, malachite, and calcite are found in a tabular zone approximately 600-700 ft long and 20 ft wide (Kelley, 1949; Harrer and Kelly, 1963). The zone strikes N40°W. The host rock is San Andres Limestone and the deposit occurs near a porphyritic dike

which strikes northeast. Iron content varies (Harrer and Kelly, 1963). Copper is low, 0.01% Cu (Table 2). The deposit may contain several tens of thousands of tons of iron ore (Moore and others., 1985). Smaller replacement iron deposist are found in sec. 23, T12S, R10E and sec. 19, T12S, Rl IE. In sec. 23, magnetite and hematite occurs in small tabular bodies in San Andres Limestone along a porphyry dike.
Volcanic-epithermal vein deposits South of Three Rivers Canyon in Lincoln County (sec. 34, 35, T10S, R10E), three shafts and two pits expose small volcanic-epithermal veins in Walker Andesite Breccia that contain quartz, fluorite, malachite, azurite, and calcite (Table 1). The veins are up to 1 ft wide in a zone 5 ft wide, 20-50 ft long, and exhibit banding and crustification of quartz. Argillic alteration consisting of chlorite, kaolinite, illite, and quartz is common. One sample reportedly assayed 0.3-0.5 oz/ton Ag and 0.57% Cu (Table 3; Segerstrom and others., 1979). Additional volcanic-epithermal veins are scattered throughout the Black Mountains (Table 1; Moore and others., 1985), but are low in gold and silver (Tables 2 and 3).
ASSESSMENT OF ENVIRONMENTAL GEOCHEMISTRY AND MINERAL RESOURCE POTENTIAL OF THE THREE RIVERS AREA
In the Spring of 1996, field work was carried out in support of a mineral resource and environmental geochemical investigation of the Three Rivers study area which surrounds the Three Rivers Petroglyph Site, on lands administrated by the U. S. Bureau of Land Management, Las Cruces, New Mexico.
Three Rivers, in its upper reaches, is the only perennial stream in the study area, therefore water quality is an important issue. Because of the importance of water quality, the determination of water chemistry and the processes responsible for the controls on the mobility and attenuation of elements in water is the focus of the environmental geochemistry investigation.
Three Rivers Area The Three Rivers area, which includes the Petroglyph Site is characterized by small
Tertiary-age dikes and sills that intrude Triassic and Cretaceous sediments. Much of the surface is low relief and consists of coalescing alluvial fans whose source is the Godfrey Hills and the western flank of Black Mountain to the east.
The study area lies within the northern Chihuahuan desert. The climate is semi-arid with hot dry summers and mild winters. Average annual precipitation (Fig. 3) is around 12 inches. About 60 % of the precipitation occurs during May through September as thunderstorms (Hood and Herrick, 1965). Vegetation is mostly mixed desert scrub and desert grassland.
The upper reaches of Three Rivers is the only perennial stream in the study area. A dendritic pattern of ephemeral streams is present and after storms, these ephermal streams may flow for short periods of time. These ephermal streams drain into Three Rivers and the Tularosa Basin. Regional ground water flow, based on ground water surface elevations (Fig. 4), is to the Tularosa Basin to the west. The source of recharge to the water bearing formations is local precipitation and runoff from the upper western slopes of the Sierra Blanca massif to the east.

Methods for collection and analysis of samples Waters were collected from 4 wells, 5 springs, and Three Rivers (Fig. 5) within the
ACSC area during April 25-26, 1996. Generally, wells were pumping prior to arrival at the site. If the wells were not pumping, they were allowed, if possible, to pump for 15 minutes before collecting the sample. Temperature, pH, and conductivity were measured at the site. Samples were collected into high-density polyethylene acid-washed bottles. For the dissolved cation analyses, a 60-ml sample was filtered through a 0.45 um-membrane filter and acidified with reagent-grade concentrated nitric acid to pH<2. A second 60-ml sample was collected and acidified without filtering to determine total cations in solution. A 125-ml sample was filtered but not acidified for anion analyses. The samples were stored in an ice chest and kept cool until analyzed.
Upon return to the laboratory, alkalinity as HCO3", was determined by titration with H2SO4 using a Grans plot technique (Orion Research, Inc., 1978). Ca, Mg, Na, K, and SiO2 were determined by flame atomic absorption spectrophotometry (Perkin-Elmer Corp., 1976). Sulfate, chloride, nitrite + nitrate, and fluorine were determined by Water Resource Division (W. D'Angleo-analyst) by ion chromatography (Fishman and Pyen, 1979). The remaining elements (Table 4) were analyzed by ICP-MS by ACTLABS, Wheatridge, Colorado.
Stream sediments were collected by compositing the sample across the width and depth of the active drainage channel. The drainages were dry at the time of collection. In the laboratory, the samples were sieved at 0.180 um and the less than fraction analyzed by instrumental neutron activation analysis or inductively coupled plasma emission (Table 6) after total digestion by ACTLABS, Wheatridge, Colorado.
Results of the geochemical survey of the Three Rivers area surrounding the Petroglyph Site Few rock outcrops are exposed in the Three Rivers area. Therefore a geochemical survey
utilizing water and stream sediment samples was carried out. The chemical analyses for the 10 water samples (Fig. 5) collected from wells, springs, and one stream are shown in Table 4 . The waters are high in dissolved solids. Conductivity ranges from 1504 to 5090 uS/cm. The pH values range from 7.16 to 8.18. The waters are fresh to slightly saline and classified according to the dominant cation and anion. All ten sampes are Ca2+- SO42+ dominant waters. The U.S. Public Health Service (1962) recommends that a drinking water supply should contain less than 250 ppm sulfate or chloride, where better water is not available. Using this classification, the well waters are of poor quality for domestic use, but better water is not available. The waters are used mostly for watering livestock. The most objectionable element in the well waters is sulfate followed by chloride. Moderate concentrations of nitrate, up to 4.4 ppm (Table 4) are present in the waters. This may be due to leaching of cattle waste. Cattle will congregate around wells and springs. Leaching of nitrate from cattle waste during runoff after storms and leaking of nitrate into the ground water in the vicinity of the well may account for the high values. Addition investigation would be needed to document this.
The concentrations of the heavy metals is generally low. The highest concentrations is manganese, with values up to 720 ppb, zinc, with values to 380 ppb, and iron, with values to 124 ppb. The remaining heavy metals are lower in concentrations. Of the base metals, only Cu, Mo, Cr, and U occur in anomalous concentrations above normal background abundances (Table 4).

When water is pumped from the wells, the water comes into contact with metal pumps, pipes, and rods, which may be the source for the anomalous values of Fe, Zn, Cu, and Mo in the well water. Most of the remaining trace elements are generally at background-type concentrations of less than 1 ppb, except for the rare earth elements (REE). The concentrations of REE La, Ce, Pr, Nd, Tb, Yb, and Lu are highly anomalous compared to average stream waters (Table 5). Most of the remaining trace elements are generally at background-type concentrations of less than 1 ppb.
In addition to the water samples, stream sediment samples were collected in fall, 1996 in the vicinity of well site TR01 (Fig. 5), which was anomalous in REE (Table 4). The high concentrations or REE in the well water suggest that the source is in the immediate vicinity and upstream from well site TR01 and that the source is a soluble REE-bearing mineral. No other water sources were available for sampling in the immediate area, therefore a stream sediment survey was carried out to determine the potential sources for REE mineralization (Fig.6).
The results of the detailed stream sediment survey is shown in Table 6. Copper concentrations in the stream sediments are low, a few sites are weakly anomalous in Pb and Zn, and the REE elements are probably above background values. The most significant geochemical anomaly is gold, which reaches a value of 0.4 ppm at site SOI. Other sites are weakly anomalous in gold concentrations.
Stream sediments were also collected in 1976 as part of the U.S. Department of Energy's National Uranium Resource Evaluation (NURE) program. Geochemical data for 18 sites in the Three Rivers area were obtained from Hoffman and Buttleman (1994) and is shown in Fig. 7 and Table 7. Anomalous Zn is present at site N01 and anomalous Zn and Cu are present at site Nl 8. Except for these two sites, the remaining sites contained mostly normal background values for the elements shown in Table 7, and no anomalous patterns are discernable . Au and Ag were not determined.
Chemical modeling of the waters To gain understanding of processes such as speciation of elements, redox conditions, and
identification of minerals that may control the mobility, attenuation, and concentrations of elements in the waters, chemical modeling of the well waters was carried out using PHREEQC (Parkhurst, 1995). The modeling program assumes mineral-solution equilibrium. For some chemical reactions with slow kinetics, this may not be the case. The dominant cations in the well waters are simple cations of Ca2+, Na+, Mg2+ and K+ or sulfate complexes CaSO4° and MgSO4°. The dominate anions are SO42", HCO3~, Cl~, and F". Other dominant species include Fe2+, FeSO4°, Mn2+, MnSO4°, Zn2+, ZnSO4°, Cu+, and Cu2+.
Saturation indexes were calculated for a suite of minerals to determine if concentrations of trace metals in water were controlled by mineral phases. The saturation index is a convenient means of expressing saturation states of minerals (Barnes and Clark, 1969 where: SI=log10 IAP/KT. In the expression, SI is the saturation index, IAP is the ion activity product, and KT is the equilibrium constant of the dissolution reaction at the temperature in question. We considered mineral phases supersaturated at SI>0, saturated or near saturation at SI= -0.3 to 0, and under saturated at SK0.3
The results (Table 8) indicate that calcite and chalcedony are near or supersaturated with

respect to the waters, indicating that these mineral phases play a major role in controlling the concentrations of Ca2+, HCO3", and SiO2 in the waters. Waters at sites TR05, 26,27, and 28 are saturated or near saturation with respect to gypsum, suggesting that these waters are in contact with and readily dissolve the gypsum. All the waters are saturated or supersaturated with respect to dolomite, indicating that the waters are in contact with dolomite. All the waters are undersaturated with respect to fluorite.
The oxidation potential (Eh) of the well waters were calculated using PHREEQE, assuming equilibrium of the waters with respect to ferrihydrite. The Eh values ranged from the 0.172 to -0.011 volts (Table 8). The most reducing conditions are Golondrina well, TR07 and Crosby spring, TR28.

Processes controlling water geochemistry The source of the water in the study area is precipitation which falls within the immediate
area and the Godfrey Hills and Black Mountain to the west. The chemical composition of the water is derived from the minerals in which the water comes into contact. Therefore the composition of the bedrocks is a major factor in the type of natural waters generated within the study area. In addition, wind-bourn dust picked up within the study area or from outside the study area can be deposited as eolian material within the study area. Waters, coming into contact with this material, can pick up additional constituents. The most dominant processes controlling ground water chemistry within the study area are the dissolution of gypsum and the interaction of water with carbonate rocks.
Waters in contact with limestone and dolomitic limestone will have increased concentrations in Ca2+, Mg2+, and HCO3~. The presents of the HCO3~ ion imparts an acid buffering capacity on the waters proportional to the concentration of H+. The bicarbonate ion will consume FT ions and raise the pH (reaction 1).

Buffering of the H+ by bicarbonate ion: H+ + HCO3- -> H2CO3

[1 ]

The pH of water in equilibrium with calcite at 25°C and PCO2 = 10'240, which is the calculated average PCO2 of the waters using PHREEQEC, will be buffered by the calcite to a pH value of approximately 7.7 ( see Drever, 1982, p.46-49 for details on the calculations). If these waters come into contact with acid waters from processes such as oxidizing sulfides or acid rain, the waters have a natural buffering capacity for neutralizing the introduced acid.
The dissolution of gypsum is responsible for the high concentrations of Ca2+ and SO42~ of most of the waters within the study area. Gypsum occurs within several formations within the Permian sedimentary rocks. In addition, gypsum which dissolves easily, has done so in the past and reprecipitated when runoff containing high concentrations of Ca2+ and SO42" evaporated or formed temporary shallow lakes which dried up. This material then can be easily picked up by the wind and redistributed where it is again available for dissolution. So the gypsum is ubiquitous in both the surface and subsurface within the study area.
The presence and dissolution of gypsum is probably causing the process of dedolomitization in the subsurface. This process, described by Black and others (1983), begins with gypsum dissolutions and the release of Ca2+ ions to the water. With the increase in Ca2+,

28

calcium carbonate precipitates, decreasing the carbonate ions. The decrease in carbonate ions from the waters causes undersaturation and dissolution with respect to dolomite. The net effect of this process is the increase of Ca2+, Mg2+, and SO42", a decrease in pH, and a slight decrease in bicarbonate concentration (see Miller, 1997 for details).
Other processes within the study area include: 1) dissolution of halite; 2) the precipitation of halite in the surface because of capillary action and evaporation; 3) oxidation of organic material in the aquifer causing a reduction in oxidation potential. The elevated chloride contents of the ground waters is probably due to dissolution of halite present in rocks such as the Mancos shale. Halite is often present during deposition of shales because of the high content Cl' in sea water. Because of the presence of gypsum and halite, ground waters in contact with the Permian shales will be high in Ca2+, Na2+, and SO42'.
Chemistry of waters in contact with the igneous alkalic rocks will be much different from waters in contact with the Permian sedimentary rocks. These waters will evolve to Ca2+ - HCO3~ waters of low ionic strength with pH values of neutral to slightly alkaline. They will not be as well buffered as the waters in contact with carbonate rocks. No waters within the study area are derived solely from areas of igneous rocks. The small amount of precipitation which falls on the alkalic igneous rocks and the subsurface water which comes into contact with the igneous rocks will evolve toward low-ionic strength waters, but then will mix with waters derived from the Permian sedimentary rocks.
As shown earlier, water at 25°C and PCO2 = 10~240 in contact with carbonate minerals, which are abundant in the bedrocks of the study area, should be buffered to a pH value of approximately 7.7. The average pH values of the waters is 7.52, which is slightly lower than buffering by calcite, indicating that other processes may be responsible for the lower pH. In the Cornudus Mountains to the south, pH was significantly lower then that predicted by buffer by calcite only (Miller, 1997). In the Cornudus Mountains area, much of the lower pH values were attributed to the oxidation of sporatic petroleum and organic material present within the sedimentary rocks. This does not appear to be the case in the Three Rivers area. The process which is probably responsible for the slightly lower pH values is dedolomitization which lowers pH. Another process which could also lowering pH is that some of the sulfate, which is abundant in the ground waters, may be reduced to HS" or H2S by the reducing environment. The process will generate acid which will lower the pH of the waters. The reducing environment and acid pH values will also cause the release of iron and manganese to the ground waters.
Environmental geochemistry of the Three Rivers study area Natural and anthropogenic-related sources can contribute heavy metals and acid to the
environment. The purpose of this section is to determine environmental problems that may presently exist or potentially exist if mining occurs within the study area in the future. The study area is sparsely populated, no industry is present, and no mining has taken place. Therefore, environmental concerns must be considered in the context of geology and in particular, the composition of the rocks. Any present geochemical environmental problems are the result of natural processes that occur when the rocks of the study area are subjected to chemical and mechanical weathering. The oxidation of pyrite will have the greatest effect of releasing acid and heavy metals to the natural waters of an area. Pyrite appears to be absent in the surface rocks

of the Three Rivers area, and the subsurface rocks are not known to contain significant amounts of pyrite. In addition, the rocks present in the study area, namely limestones, sandstones, and alkalic igneous rocks, generally contain normal low concentrations of trace elements such as Zn, Cu, Pb, Cd, and Hg. Shales, particularly black shales, can have anomalous concentrations of metals, but this does not appear to be the case for shales in the study area. Other trace elements in the rocks, such as As, are also apparently low. Consequently there are minimal heavy metals and acid released from the rocks to the waters during normal weathering.
Two lithologies present in the surface and/or subsurface of the Three River area are effective for mitigation any acid drainage that may presently or in the future be generated: 1) limestones and dolomites and 2) caliche that is abundant and often cements Quaternary alluvium. Tertiary lacustrine beds containing calcite may also occur. The carbonate minerals react with the waters, buffer the H+, and raise the pH. Heavy metals such as Cu and Zn, if present, will hydrolyze and precipitate at the higher pH values.
The other major rock group in the study area are the alkaline intrusive rocks. These rocks have less buffering capacity than the carbonate rocks, mainly form minerals such as plagioclase. But the ubiquitous occurrence of calcite in the surficial material will provide buffering capacity to neutralize any acid generated in the surface environment.
Climate plays a significant role in geochemical processes. Water is necessary for chemical weathering to occur. The climate of the study area is semi-arid. Because of the low annual precipitation, chemical weathering at the surface probably takes place in pulses when water is present following runoff from storms. Within the zone of ground water, water is in contact with the rocks and chemical processes are taking place.
The geochemical environmental consequences of future mining depend on the type of mine that would be developed. If a REE, base metal, or precious metal deposit containing pyrite was developed, acid and metal release would occur, but the large amounts of carbonate minerals in the surrounding rocks and surfical material would quickly buffer the acid and metals. So the effect on the surface would be minimal.
In summary, the main geochemical environmental concern presently in the study area is: (1) the presence of slightly saline water due to the abundant gypsum and sometimes halite; (2) the neutral to slightly acid ground waters due to dedolomitization or reduction of sulfate; and (3) the moderately elevated concentrations of nitrate, possibly due to leaching of cattle wastes in the vicinity of well sites. These problems, except for the nitrate, are due to natural processes that have operated for at least 1000's of years. Possible future mining would probably have no significant impact on the chemistry of the surface or ground waters.
Mineral resource potential of the Three Rivers Petroglyph Site In order to not disturb the protected prehistoric site, no solid samples were collected from
the Petroglyph Site. Samples for mineral resource evaluation were collected from the BLM land surrounding the site and are discussed later. Exposed rocks within the Petroglyph Site show no evidence of hydrothermal alteration or mineralization. The trachybasalt sills and small plugs appear to lack any associated alteration or mineralized zones; the only alteration associated with their implacement is the structural dilation of the intruded rocks and the baking of those rocks near the intrusive contacts. Based on observation of surface outcrops only, no evidence was seen
30

to indicate potential for mineral resources at the Three Rivers Petroglyph Site.
Mineral resource potential of the Three Rivers study area The high concentrations of rare earth elements La, Ce, Pr, Nd, Tb, Yb, and Lu in the
alkaline waters indicate that the REE-bearing minerals are soluble in water. Most REE-bearing minerals are refractory, such as monozite, xenotime, or cerite, and are generally insoluble in waters, except under extreme acid conditions. The most likely mineral that is the source for the REE metals in the alkaline waters in the Three Rivers area is bastnasite, a REE-bearing fluorcarbonate. Bastnasite is an important ore mineral in REE deposits such as Mountain Pass, California. Bastnasite occurs along with copper and fluorite in the Gallinas Mountains, about 40 miles to the north of Three Rivers. The deposits, which are small in size, are associated with a trachyte laccolith, and consist of low-temperature epithermal veins and breccia fillings in the Yeso Formation (Perhac, 1970).
The results of the stream sediment survey during the NURE program in the Three Rivers area indicate two anomalous sites but no discernable pattern. Au and Ag were not determined. A detailed stream sediment survey in 1996 indicates that gold mineralization as well as REE mineralization may be present. Highly anomalous concentrations of gold occur at site SOI as well as weakly anomalous concentrations of Au, Pb, and Zn at other sites (Fig. 6 and Table 5).
The belt of alkalic intrusive rocks (Kelly and Thompson, 1964) that occurs to the north and east of the study area is associated with mineralization, particularly gold deposits as discussed earlier.
REE metals and precious metal deposits occur to the north of the Three Rivers area as intrusive breccia-pipe deposits and epithermal veins at Nogal and White Oaks districts in Lincoln county (McLemore, 1991). If REE and Au mineralization is present in the Three Rivers area, it is likely that the age and occurrence is similar to these districts to the north.
The anomalous concentrations of REE metals in the water samples and the anomalous concentration of Au in stream sediments is permissive evidence for moderate potential for REE and gold mineralization in the Three Rivers area. The bedrock in the study area is mostly covered with coalesced alluvial fans. Only a few small outcrops of intrusive rock are present. The intrusive rocks are mainly lamprophyric sills and dikes striking approximately north-south. The intrusive rocks are associated in age with the Sierra Blanca igneous complex. Based only on cursory look, the intrusive rocks show no obvious signs of hydrothermal alteration at the surface. Well site TR01 is probably less than 200 feet deep and contains water which is anomalous in REE. This suggests that the mineralization is probably in the shallow subsurface.
It should be noted that this anomaly is based on scant evidence and further studies, particularly subsurface drilling, are needed in order to confirm or deny the presence of subsurface mineralization.
