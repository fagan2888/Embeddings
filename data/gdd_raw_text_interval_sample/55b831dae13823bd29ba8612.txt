The Miocene Pi llarian and Newportian (Molluscan) Stages of Washington and Oregon and Their Usefulness in Correlations From Alaska to California

By Ellen J. Moore and Warren 0. Addicott

Abstract
Mollusks are common to abundant in shallow-water facies, which predominate in many geographically isolated Tertiary basins, and are reliable for correlation. The global cooling that began during middle Miocene (Newportian Stage, in part) and increased in intensity across the middle to late Miocene boundary (Newportian, in part, to Wishkahan Stage) strongly affected the usefulness of mollusks for correlating these stages from California to Alaska. The warming trend that peaked during the late early and early middle Miocene, however, allows good correlations between the "Temblor" Stage of California and the middle part of the Newportian Stage of the Pacific Northwest. Mollusks restricted to either the Pillarian or Newportian and those with first or last occurrences in either stage have helped to identify the two stages and to differentiate between them. Additional collecting and appraisal of faunas show that these molluscan stages can be further refined and divided on the basis of peak occurrences of molluscan species that are related, in part, to global changes in climate.
Unnamed Miocene sediments at Coos Bay, Ore., are Newportian in age but probably somewhat older than the Astoria Formation in the Newport embayment, Oregon. The lower part of a section of unnamed Miocene sediments in northern California is Newportian in age, based on the occurrence of Molopophorus matthewi Etherington, and the upper part of the section is no younger than Newportian.
INTRODUCTION
The initial chronostratigraphic framework for the marine Cenozoic of the Western United States was proposed by Arnold (1906) for California. He used names of formations in the sense that we use our present stages and defined the biostratigraphic units mostly by distinctive invertebrate assemblages, principally pectinids. These units were refined and modified on the basis of mollusks by subsequent workers (Smith, 1912; Clark, 1921, 1929; Loel and Corey, 1932) who variously termed them "faunas," "formations," or "horizons." Kleinpell (1938) proposed Miocene benthic

foraminiferal stages for California and reviewed the relations of the molluscan sequence to his stages.
In contrast to California, Neogene strata are distributed less widely in Oregon, Washington, British Columbia, and Alaska, where marine basins, most extensive during the early and middle Miocene, consisted of isolated coastal embayments from southern Oregon to the Queen Charlotte Islands and the Gulf of Alaska (fig. 1). Weaver (1916a) proposed faunal zones for western Washington on the basis of molluscan faunas and key species and later correlated the Tertiary sequence of the Pacific Northwest with the California formations by using the existing formational names as stages (Weaver, 1942).
In 1944, a basic framework for all Pacific Coast Cenozoic molluscan correlation was prepared under Weaver's chairmanship (Weaver and others, 1944). In that correlation scheme, Neogene stages were first used, and zonal index fossils were cited. These stages, however, were based primarily on type sections in California and were difficult to use in correlating within and beyond the Pacific Northwest. Previously, Schenck (1936) had proposed three biozones for Oregon and Washington on the basis of species of the bivalveAcila, and Durham (1944) proposed seven megafossil zones for northwestern Washington. These zones proved so useful for provincial correlation that they still are used today.
For the Pacific Northwest, Addicott (1976b) proposed a series of six Neogene molluscan stages that have type sections in Washington and Oregon and correlated them with California benthic foraminiferal stages; later, he somewhat modified the ages of the molluscan stages (Addicott, 1981, 1983). Armentrout (1975) proposed the late Eocene and early Oligocene Galvinian and Oligocene Matlockian (molluscan) Stages; to avoid conflict with the late Oligocene part of the Juanian (molluscan) Stage of Addicott (1976b), he (1977, 1981) subsequently revised the Matlockian to include only the early Oligocene. Using Durham's (1944) megafossil zones for the Oligocene, Addicott (1976b) also

proposed new molluscan zones for his Miocene molluscan stages. These stages and zones, intended originally for provincial correlation, have been used to correlate these units with Tertiary units north to Alaska (Allison, 1978; Marincovich, 1983; Allison and Marincovich, 1981) and south to middle California (Moore, 1984).
Armentrout and others (1984) have summarized the correlation of Cenozoic molluscan stages of Oregon and Washington with microfossil datum planes and with megaflora! and mammalian stages and radiometric dates. Poore and others (1981) have presented a biochronology standard for the Miocene of the Eastern Pacific by correlating planktic foraminifer, coccolith, and diatom zones with California molluscan stages.
This paper focuses on the early Miocene Pillarian and the early and middle Miocene Newportian (molluscan) Stages proposed by Addicott (1976b) that have type sections in Washington and Oregon, respectively. These stages primarily are based on range zones of taxa, mostly endemic species. Some difficulty may be encountered, however, in distinguishing the Pillarian and Newportian Stages when the key zonal species Vertipecten fucanus (Dall) and Patinopecten propatulus (Conrad) are not present. Additional collecting and appraisal of faunas has led to the recognition of more molluscan species that serve to distinguish the Pillarian and Newportian Stages and also has led to distinguishing times of peak abundance for some species that permit subdivisions within a stage.

PILLARIAN AND NEWPORTIAN STAGES
The Pillarian Stage (Addicott. 1976b) is defined in rocks which contain an inner sublittoral molluscan fauna and is of early Miocene age. The Clallam Formation. designated as the type section of the Pillarian. directly overlies the type section of the Juanian of late Oligocene and early Miocene

age, and the lower boundary of the Pillarian is placed at the contact between the Twin River Formation and the overlying Clallam Formation. The Clallam Formation is not overlain by younger strata at its type section along the Strait of Juan de Fuca. Wash .. so the top of the Pillarian Stage could not be defined in that area. Therefore, the upper boundary stratotype was defined as the contact between the Nye Mudstone and the overlying Astoria Formation exposed south of Yaquina Bay. Ore. (fig. I). The Pillarian originally was dated as late early Miocene but subsequently has been revised to include the early early Miocene (Allison. 1977. 1978: Addicott. 1983 ). and this usage is here accepted.
Mollusks recognized by Addicott ( 1976b) as restricted to the Pillarian Stage in the Eastern Pacific include the pelecypods Vertipecten .fitcanus (Oall), Mytilus n. sp. aff. M. tichanm·itchi Makiyama of Allison and Addicott ( 1976), and Macoma optira (Yokoyama). and the gastropods Prisn~fltsus aff. P. geniculus (Conrad) of Moore ( 1963) and Aforia tricarinata Addicott. Additional mollusks now known to be restricted to, or with their last occurrence in, the Pillarian are the pelecypods Acila (Acila) gettysburgensis (Reagan) and Anomalocardia carmanahensis (Clark) and the gastropod. Epitonium (Cirsotrema) clallamensis Durham.

The Newportian Stage (fig. 1) is based on the molluscan fauna in the Astoria Formation in the Newport embayment on the coast of northwestern Oregon. Originally dated as middle Miocene, it subsequently has been revised (Addicott, 1977) to include the late early Miocene (fig. 2). The lower boundary is placed at the base of the Astoria Formation, best exposed in sea cliffs between Yaquina Head and Newport. Ore. The top of the Newportian is best defined in the Astoria Formation in southwestern Washington (Addicott. 1976b), where the upper part is conformably overlain by the Montesano Formation of Fowler (1965) that contains shallow-water molluscan assemblages referable to the late middle Miocene Wishkahan Stage (ftg. 2). Allison (1977, 1978) revised the Wishkahan to include the late middle Miocene as well as the late Miocene, and this usage is here accepted.
Mollusks recognized by Addicott (1976b) as restricted in stratigraphic occurrence to the Newportian Stage include the pelecypods Aequipecten andersoni clemonensis (Etherington), Mytilus (Plicatomytilus) middendorffi Grewingk, Patinopecten propatulus (Conrad), and Saccella amelga Moore and the gastropods Acteon boulderanus Etherington, Antillophos posunculensis (Anderson and Martin), Chlorostoma pacificum (Anderson and Martin), "Nassarius"

N. lima Gmelin of Moore (1963), Opalia williamsoni (Anderson and Martin), Priscofusus medialis (Conrad), Spirotropis washingtonensis Etherington, and Trophon kernensis Anderson. Other mollusks now known to be restricted to the Newportian are the pelecypods Macoma flagleri Etherington, Spisula (Mactromeris) selbyensis Packard, and Yoldia carnerosensis Clark and the gastropods Cancellaria ocoyana Addicott, Molopophorus anglonanus (Anderson), Molopophorus mattewi Etherington, Nucella packi (Clark), and Olivella ischnon Keen.
In addition to the mollusks known to be restricted to either the Pillarian or the Newportian Stages, the combination of first and last occurrences of species further identifies the two stages, and some of these ranges are shown graphically in table 1. The Newportian Stage can be correlated with the "Temblor" Stage of California (Weaver and others, 1944) on the basis of the cooccurrence of molluscan species. Correlation of the Pillarian Stage with the "Vaqueros" Stage of California (Weaver and others, 1944) has not been feasible using mollusks. The predominately tropical and subtropical molluscan fauna of the "Vaqueros," from the northwardtransported west side of the San Andreas fault, has not been recognized in Washington or Oregon.
RATIONALE OF MOLLUSCAN DISTRIBUTION AND CORRELATION
Past discussions of climate, as interpreted by molluscan distribution and by most other biologic groups, were premised on two assumptions: temperature tolerances of species remained the same through time and the continents were fixed. Tectonic reconstructions have shown that fragments of the Pacific coastal areas of North America have been transported long distances along strike-slip faults and that terranes from distant areas to the south and east have been accreted to the coast of North America at various times. In addition, the cooccurrence of both subtropical and cold-water molluscan genera within the same stratigraphic interval, especially in Alaska, indicates that some parameters of past molluscan distributions do not match those of today; for example, in the Narrow Cape Formation of Newportian age on Kodiak Island, the warm-water genera Dosinia s. s., Securella, and Anadara s. s. are found with genera of cool-water aspect, such as Neptunea and Mya. Nevertheless, some patterns of distribution that are related to climatic events seem evident.
Post-Eocene steepening of latitudinal climatic gradients and the accompanying development of restricted molluscan faunal provinces isolated the faunas of the Pacific Northwest from California for prolonged periods of time. Warming events interrupted this pattern, most noticeably in the late early and early middle Miocene, when the warm temperate and subtropical to tropical molluscan faunas of California reached as far north as the western part of the Gulf of

Alaska. This Miocene warming and its wide dispersal of species allows both tentative and definite assignment of formations to the Newportian Stage from Alaska south to California ("Temblor" Stage). The occurrence in the Newportian of genera such as the pelecypods Dosinia s. s. and Securella and the gastropod Ficus, genera now living in subtropical to tropical regions, indicates that, during the early middle Miocene, the ocean as far north as the Alaska Peninsula may have been much warmer than it is today. Warming was not sufficient during the older Pillarian Stage, however, to make definite ties between the Pacific northwest and California, although the cephalopod Aturia flourished during the late Juanian and early Pillarian.
The global warming trend across the early and middle Miocene boundary (Woodruff and others, 1981) allowed the dispersal of subtropical to tropical molluscan genera as far north as the western part of the Gulf of Alaska (Addicott, 1969). As stated above, warm-water genera are found in the Narrow Cape Formation of Newportian age on Kodiak Island (Allison, 1978). However, in the northeastern Gulf of Alaska, the middle Miocene faunas in the lower part of the Yakataga Formation (Addicott, 1969) and in the Topsy Formation (Marincovich, 1979) include no warm-water genera. Thus, the Topsy and Yakataga faunas presumably coincide with or postdate the major cooling event.
The distribution in Oregon of the warm-water genus Dosinia s. s. is particularly interesting. It is extremely common in the dredgings of unnamed Miocene sediment in the Coos Bay channel, where more than 200 specimens were collected in a short period of time (Moore, 1963). Yet Dosinia s. s. has not been collected from the Astoria Formation in the Newport area, about 140 kilometers north of Coos Bay, despite its record from the Gulf of Alaska in the Newportian. We believe, therefore, that the maximum warming trend occurred in the early Newportian and that the unnamed Miocene sediment at the Coos Bay channel is older than the Astoria Formation at Newport, although still assigned to the Newportian on the basis of Mytilus (Plicatomytilus) middendorfi Grewingk. The upper part of the Astoria Formation in southwestern Washington is the youngest unit assigned to the Newportian.
ALASKA
Formations Assigned to the Pillarian Stage
The uppermost part of the Poul Creek Formation, in the northeastern Gulf of Alaska, was assigned to the Pillarian (Addicott, 1977) on the basis of the occurrence of the zonal fossil Vertipecten fucanus and associated mollusks such as Acila (Acila) gettysburgensis, which are not known to occur in younger strata (Allison, 1978). The lower part of the Yakataga Formation on Kayak Island, also in the northeastem Gulf of Alaska, was assigned to the Pillarian on the basis of the cooccurrence of the pelecypod A. (A.) gettysburgensis

with foraminifers of Saucesian or Relizian age (Allison, 1978).
Formations Assigned to the Newportian Stage
The type Narrow Cape Formation on Kodiak Island was assigned to the Newportian on the basis of the occurrence throughout the section (Allison, 1978) of Mytilus (Plicatomytilus) middendorffi Grewingk, a mytilid that occurs in the Newportian as far south as central California. The Unga Conglomerate Member of the Bear Lake Formation on the Alaska Peninsula is believed to be late Newportian in age on the basis of the combined ranges of a few molluscan taxa (Allison, 1978). Strata near the base of the Yakataga Formation at Yakataga Reef, Alaska, were assigned to the Newportian on the basis of the presence of Macoma arctata (Conrad), not known to occur in strata younger than Newportian, and the genus Lituyapecten, not known to occur in strata older than Newportian (Addicott, 1974). On the basis of overlapping ranges ofPillarian and Newportian mollusks, the Topsy Formation in the Lituya district was inferred to be of Newportian age (Marincovich, 1979).
BRITISH COLUMBIA
Strata that can be assigned to either the Pillarian or Newportian Stages have not been found in British Columbia. Division D of Jeletzky (1954, 1973) and the type Sooke Formation are assigned to the late Oligocene and the earliest Miocene Juanian Stage.
WASHINGTON
Formations Assigned to the Pillarian Stage
The Clallam Formation, exposed in northernmost Washington along the Strait of Juan de Fuca, was designated the type section for the Pillarian Stage (Addicott, 1976b). The zonal fossil, Vertipectenfucanus, is the most characteristic mollusk in faunal assemblages from the Clallam. The Hoh Formation of Weaver (1915), just to the south on the westem side of the Olympic Mountains, also was assigned to the Pillarian on the basis of the occurrence of Vertipecten fucanus. Strata assigned to the Astoria Formation in Wahkiakum and Pacific Counties, Wash. (Wolfe and McKee, 1972) include faunas characteristic of the Pillarian and the Newportian Stages. On the basis of the occurrence of pectinid zonal fossils and on first and last occurrences of associated mollusks, unit I (Wolfe and McKee, 1972) in the lower part of the Astoria Formation in southwestern Washington was assigned to the Pillarian (Addicott, 1976b).

Formations Assigned to the Newportian Stage
The Astoria Formation in the southern part of the Montesano quadrangle east of Grays Harbor and units II and III in the Astoria Formation in the Grays River quadrangle, Wahkiakum County (Wolfe and McKee, 1972), were assigned to the Newportian on the basis of the zonal fossil Patinopecten propatulus and associated mollusks and benthic foraminifers (Addicott, 1976b).
OREGON
Formations Assigned to the Pillarian Stage
Vertipecten fucanus and Patinopecten propatulus, zonal fossils from the Pillarian and Newportian Stages, respectively, are present in the Dana collection from the type area of the Astoria Formation in Astoria, Ore. (Conrad, 1849). The original exposures of the Astoria Formation are now covered by the city of Astoria, thereby prohibiting verification of the occurrence. Other mollusks from the type Astoria Formation that have their last occurrence in the Pillarian (Addicott, 1976c) are Acila (Acila) gettysburgensis (Reagan) and Aturia angustata (Conrad) (Addicott, 1976b; 1976c). On the basis of the available data, the lower part of the type Astoria Formation is assumed to be Pillarian in age.
In the Astoria Formation in northwestern Oregon, some exposures contain meager and poorly preserved molluscan faunas that seem to be late Pillarian or early Newportian in age, but no definite assignment can be made. Specimens believed to represent Patinopecten oregonesis cancellosus Moore have been found in some of these collections. This species originally was described from the unnamed sediment at the Coos Bay channel, but it has since been found in the uppermost part of the Nye Mudstone at the northeast side of the Newport embayment. Future study likely will show that this pectinid is restricted to the late Pillarian and early Newportian. It is not known to cooccur with Vertipecten fucanus or Patinopecten propatulus. Dosinia (Dosinia) whitneyi (Gabb) also occurs in the unnamed sediment at the Coos Bay channel and has been found in southem California in the Wygal Sandstone Member of the Temblor Formation [previously known as the Phacoides Sand Member of Stinemeyer and others (1959)] (Addicott, 1973), the San Ramon Sandstone (Clark, 1918), and the "Sobrante Sandstone" (Lutz, 1951). All but possibly the "Sobrante Sandstone" are pre-Newportian in age. Loel and Corey (1932) have called attention to the abundance of the pelecypod Dosinia s. s. in the "Vaqueros" Stage, which is represented by a subtropical to tropical fauna. Today, Dosinia s.s. lives no farther north than Baja California. The post-Oligocene warming trend reached a peak probably in the late early and early middle Miocene. This was followed

Miocene Pillarian and Newportian Stages of Washington and Oregon A7

during the middle Miocene by global cooling that intensified across the middle and late Miocene boundary (Barron, 1985). In northwestern Oregon, Dosinia s. s. whitneyi has been found in the Astoria Formation of Newportian age and in the unnamed Miocene sediment at Coos Bay channel, where it is exceptionally abundant and occurs with Mytilus (Plicatomytilus) middendorfi, which is considered to be restricted to the Newportian Stage (Moore, 1963). It has not been found in the Newportian part of the Astoria Formation in the Newport area, however, and may have become extinct in Washington, Oregon, and Alaska at the end of the early Newportian. Dosinia (D.) whitneyi also is found associated with Patinopecten oregonensis cancellosus rather than with Patinopecten propatulus. Thus, the unnamed Miocene sediments at Coos Bay may represent the earliest part of the Newportian Stage, a time when Newportian mollusks were first evolving. In northwestern Oregon, Dosinia (D.) whitneyi is found in the Angora Peak Member of the Astoria Formation of Niem (1975) associated with Mytilus (P.) middenforffi.
All but the lowermost part of the Nye Mudstone in the Newport embayment was assigned to the Pillarian (Addicott, 1976b). This assignment is based on the occurrence of Vertipectenfucanus in the Nye Mudstone south of Newport and on associated mollusks and benthic foraminifers. The occurrence of Patinopecten oregonensis cancellosus in the uppermost Nye northeast of Newport may indicate that the uppermost part of the Nye is early Newportian. On the basis of Vertipecten fucanus and associated mollusks, the upper part of the Yaquina Formation south of Newport is assigned to the Pillarian.
Formations Assigned to the Newportian Stage
The upper part of the type Astoria Formation at Astoria is assigned to the Newportian on the basis of Patinopecten propatulus and associated mollusks (Conrad, 1848, 1849; Moore, 1963). Exposures of the Astoria Formation on Big Creek east of Astoria and near Cannon Beach to the south also are assigned to the Newportian (Addicott, 1976b), as is the Astoria Formation in the Cathlamet, Saddle Mountain, Cape Foulweather, and Yaquina quadrangles in northwestem Oregon (Moore, 1963). The sandstone of Floras Lake at Cape Blanco is assigned to the Newportian (Addicott, 1983) on the basis of the gastropods Molopophorus matthewi Etherington and "Nassarius" arnoldi (Anderson) and the pelecypods Mytilus (P.) middendorffi Grewingk and Macoma flagleri, all restricted to the Newportian, and on the cooccurrence of other species with longer ranges.
CALIFORNIA
The Pillarian Stage is coeval with the upper part of the "Vaqueros" Stage, and the Newportian Stage is coeval with the "Temblor" Stage, both of California.

Formations Assigned to the Pillarian Stage
Vertipecten fucanus occurs in the Jewett Sand and in the upper part of the Olcese Formation in southern California which can be correlated with the Pillarian. The Juanian and Pillarian gastropod Epitonium (Cirsostrema) clallamensis Durham also is found in the Jewett Sand. As stated above, the tropical and subtropical fauna of the "Vaqueros" Stage did not reach as far north as Oregon, and correlations between Oregon and California are difficult.
Formations Assigned to the Newportian Stage
The "Temblor" Stage of California is characterized by the restricted stratigraphic occurrence of molluscan species that also are restricted to the Newportian Stage. Species common to the two stages and restricted to them include the pelecypods Mytilus (Plicatomytilus) middendor.ffi Grewingk and Patinopecten propatulus (Conrad) and the gastropods "Nassarius" arnoldi (Anderson), Crepidula rostra/is (Conrad), Antillophos posunculensis (Anderson and Martin), Opalia williamsoni (Anderson and Martin), and Olivella ischnon Keen (Addicott, 1972). Thus, the Buttonbed Sand Member of the Temblor Formation of Stinemeyer and others (1959) as well as the Round Mountain Silt in southern California can be correlated with the Newportian (Addicott, 1970).
The pelecypods Acila (Truncacila) conradi (Dall), Delectopecten peckhami (Gabb), Katherinella (Katherinella) angustifrons (Conrad), Securella ensifera (Dall), Tel/ina emacerata Conrad, and Thracia trapezoides (Conrad) and the gastropods Ficus modesta Conrad, Megasurcula wynoocheensis (Weaver), and Molopophorus matthewi Etherington were discovered recently in unnamed Miocene sediments in northern California on the south flank of the Coast Range in the Garberville area southeast of Eureka (Barry Roth, oral commun., 1984). All of these mollusks except Acila (T.) conradi and Molopophorus matthewi are found in both the Pillarian and the Newportian. One locality that is near the base of the section (Julie Menack, oral commun., 1984) yielded the gastropod Molopophorus matthewi, restricted to the Newportian, and these unnamed sediments are assigned here to the Newportian.
BAJA CALl FORN lA
Miocene molluscan faunas in Baja California have been poorly known until recent years (Minch and others, 1970; Smith, 1984), and precise age determinations based on faunal analyses and potassium-argon dating are much less precise than those in California. Currently, the Rosarito Beach Formation is assigned to the middle Miocene (Minch and others, 1970), the Isidro Formation to the earliest Miocene to early middle .Miocene, the Tortugas Formation to the early middle Miocene, and the San Ignacio Formation to the late middle Miocene (Smith, 1984).

A8 Shorter Contributions to Paleontology and Stratigraphy

PEAK OCCURRENCES OF KEY SPECIES
Patinopecten propatulus (Conrad) is the zonal fossil of the Newportian Stage, whereas Vertipecten fucanus (Dall) identifies the Pillarian. Vertipecten is differentiated easily from species of Patinopecten when the left valve is preserved (pl. 1, fig. 5; pl. 4, figs. 9, 11) but not as easily distinguished when only the right valve is preserved (pl. 1, fig. 1; pl. 2, fig. 9; pl. 4. fig. 1). The left valve ofV.fucanus has three ribs raised above the others: the middle rib and the third rib on either side of the middle. The left valve of P. propatulus has evenly spaced, low, rounded ribs (pl. 1, fig. 4). The right-valve auricles of V. fucanus (pl. 1, fig. 9) are relatively much larger than those of P. propatulus (pl. 1, fig. 1; pl. 3, fig. 6); on V. fucanus, the length of the auricles is more than half the width of the valves, whereas on P. propatulus the auricles are less than half the width of the valves. The ribbing on right valves of V. fucanus is much more irregular than that on P. propatulus; many specimens have one or more irregular ribs in the middle part of the disk (pl. 1, fig. 10), and most specimens have a widening and deepening of the medial interspace that corresponds to the strongly raised opposing rib on the left valve.
Patinopecten propatulus is abundant in units II and III in the Astoria Formation of southwestern Washington (Wolfe and McKee, 1972) and in the Astoria Formation in the Newport embayment, and its peak occurrence is in the early middle Miocene.
Patinopecten oregonensis cancellosus Moore, originally described from the unnamed Miocene sediment of the Coos Bay channeL Oregon (Moore, 1963), has been found in abundance in the upper part of the Nye Mudstone in the Newport embayment northeast of Newport, Ore., and it has been recognized in a few collections of Newportian age from northwestern Oregon. Its peak occurrence is in the late early Miocene part of the Pillarian. Patinopecten oregonensis cancellosus may have been confused in the past with P. propatulus and V. fucanus. The right valve of P. oregonensis cancellosus (pl. 2, figs. 1, 4) has regularly spaced, strongly undercut ribs that look like railroad ties in cross section (pl. 4, fig. 5) and no strongly raised ribs on the left valve (pl. 2, fig. 5; pl. 3, fig. 1). These characters differentiate it from V. fucanus. Patinopecten oregonensis cancellosus differs from P. propatulus by having a heavier shell and by both valves having fewer ribs that are higher and more undercut than those on P. propatulus, which has a low rib profile (pl. 1, fig. 7).
Anadara (Anadara) devincta (Conrad) ranges from the late Pillarian to the Wishkahan Stages. The occurrence in the Pillarian is based on the rare occurrence of this species in the Nye Mudstone. It is not found in other stratigraphic units assigned to the Pillarian. Abundant in the Astoria Formation in the Newport embayment, this species was not found in the unnamed Miocene sediment dredged from Coos Bay channel. We believe that this indicates that the Astoria

Formation at Newport is younger than the unnamed sediment at Coos Bay channel and further suggests that the peak abundance of A. (A.) devincta was in the middle Newportian. In California, A. (A.) devincta has been collected in the Sobrante and Briones Sandstones and in the Temblor Formation.
Dosinia (D.) whitneyi (Gabb), when found in abundance, probably indicates an early Newportian age. This species occurs in Alaska in the type Narrow Cape Formation (Louie Marincovich, Jr., written commun., 1978), in Oregon, rarely in the Angora Peak Member of the Astoria Formation of Niem (1975), and abundantly in the unnamed Miocene sediment dredged from Coos Bay channel (pl. 3, fig. 13) and in California in the San Ramon Formation (Gabb, 1866; Stewart, 1930), the Wygal Sandstone Member of the Temblor Formation (Addicott, 1973), and in the "Sobrante Sandstone" of Lutz (1951). Dosinia (D.) whitneyi has not been found in the Newportian Astoria Formation in the Newport area.
Securella ensifera (Dall) ranges from the Pillarian Stage through the Newportian. Although the species is present in the Newportian and common in the unnamed Miocene sediment of Coos Bay, Ore., its peak abundance is in the Pillarian; for example, it is one of the most abundant bivalves in the Clallam Formation in Washington (Addicott, 1976a) and is common in the Nye Mudstone south of Newport, Ore. (pl. 3, fig. 9).
Anomalocardia carmanahensis (Clark) ranges from the Juanian Stage through the Pillarian and is not found in the Newportian. It is distinct and easily differentiated from the more common Pillarian and Newportian chionid Securella ensifera (pl. 3, fig. 9). Anomalocardia carmanahensis is differentiated on the basis of its very thick and rounded concentric ridges (pl. 3, figs. 4, 5) that disappear near the anterior margin. Originally described from the Sooke Formation of British Columbia, this species has been collected from strata of Pillarian age in northwestern Oregon.
Bruclarkia yaquinana (Anderson and Martin) and Bruclarkia oregonensis (Conrad) sometimes cooccur in the Pillarian Clallam Formation, but typical B. yaquinana is the most common. Typical B. oregonensis occurs almost exclusively at the top of the Clallam, and B. yaquinana occurs at or near the base (Addicott, 1976a). In the Kern River area of California, B. yaquinana is restricted in occurrence to the basal early Miocene part of the Jewett Sand. Bruclarkia yaquinana occurs in Washington in the Clallam Formation, in Oregon in the Astoria Formation and in the Nye Mudstone, and in California in the Jewett Sand and Painted Rock Sandstone Member of the Vaqueros Formation, both of early Miocene age, and in the basal part of the Saltos Shale Member of the Monterey Shale of Hill and others (1958), also of early Miocene age. The peak occurrence of B. yaquinana is in the middle early Miocene. Bruclarkia oregonensis occurs in Washington in the Clallam Formation and the Hoh Formation of Weaver (1915), in Oregon in the

Miocene Pillarian and Newportian Stages of Washington and Oregon A9

Scappoose and Astoria Formations and in the sandstone of Flores Lake (Addicott, 1983), and in California in the Sobrante(?) Sandstone, the Oursan Sandstone, lower and upper parts of the Olcese Sand, the Buttonbed Sandstone Member of the Temblor Formation, the Twisselmann Sandstone Member of the Monterey Formation of Heikkila and MacLeod ( 1951), unnamed Miocene sediment in the Santa Cruz Mountains, and the Saltos Shale Member of the Monterey Shale of Hill and others (1958). These two species occur together in the Clallam Formation of Washington and the Astoria Formation of Oregon and possibly in the Saltos Shale Member of the Monterey Shale, California, of Hill and others (1958), although B. yaquinana is restricted to the basal part. Transitional specimens (pl. 2, fig. 3) that link the two species have been found in the Astoria Formation in Oregon (Moore, 1963) and in the Clallam Formation in Washington (Addicott, 1976a). Typical B. oregonensis (pl. 2, figs. 2, 8) differs from typical B. yaquinana (pl. 2, figs. 6, 7) by having uniformly fine sculpture through all stages of growth, whereas B. yaquinana has four or five coarsely noded spiral cords on the body whorl. The peak abundance of B. yaquinana seems to be in the Pillarian, possibly continuing into the early Newportian, and the peak abundance of B. oregonensis is in the middle Newportian.
Epitonium (Cirsotrema) clallamensis Durham ranges from the Juanian to the Pillarian Stages. It occurs in the upper part of the Poul Creek Formation of the Gulf of Alaska (Kanno, 1971), in the Sooke Formation in British Columbia (Durham, 1937), in the Clallam Formation in Washington, in the Nye Mudstone south of Newport, Ore. (pl. 3, fig. 3), and in the Jewett Sand (pl. 3, fig. 11; pl. 4, figs. 7, 10) in central California (Addicott, 1970). It also has been found in the Miocene Macoma optiva molluscan zone in the Tochilinski sequence of western Kamchatka (Gladenkov and Sinelnikova, 1984). The species is distinguished by the heavy bladelike to blocky costae and by the three to nine low, broad spiral ribs that cross the costae and form nodes on the central part of the whorl.
Musashia (Nipponomelon) shikami Moore (pl. 3, fig. 12; pl. 4, fig. 3) first appeared in the early Miocene within the upper part of the Juanian Stage (Moore, 1984). This species has a wide distribution: in Alaska in the upper part of the Poul Creek Formation; in Washington in the Clallam Formation, the upper part of the Pysht Formation of the Twin River Group, and the upper part of the Lincoln Creek Formation; in Oregon in the Nye Mudstone (Howe, 1922; Moore, 1984); and in California in the Freeman-Jewett silt of Matthews (1955) and the Vaqueros Formation. Musashia (N.) shikami lacks the deeply impressed, channeled suture and strongly twisted, keellike ribs of Musashia (Miopleiona) indurata (Conrad), the Newportian volutid (pl. 3, fig. 15).
Priscofusus aff. P. geniculus (Conrad) of Moore (1963) has been found in the lower part of the Clallam Formation

in Washington and in the Nye Mudstone south of Newport, Ore. (pl. 4, fig. 8). It occurs in strata of presumed Pillarian age in northwestern Oregon and is assumed to be restricted to the Pillarian Stage.
Molopophorus matthewi Etherington and Molopophorus anglonanus (Anderson) are restricted to the Newportian. Molopophorus matthewi (pl. 1, figs. 6, 8) has a smooth, rounded body whorl, whereas M. anglonanus (pl. 1, figs. 2, 3) has a sharply angulated and noded body whorl profile.
The cephalopod Aturia angustata (Conrad) is thought to have become extinct at the end of the early Miocene (late Pillarian). This extinction may be related to the global cooling that began in the middle Miocene. The species is doubtfully identified from the Clallam Formation of Washington (Addicott, 1976a) and is positively identified from the Pysht Member of the Twin River Group. It is extremely abundant in the southwesternmost Washington (Moore, 1984) at the top of the Lincoln Creek Formation of late Juanian (earliest Miocene) age and has been found in Oregon in the Newport embayment in the Nye Mudstone of Pillarian age.
Aturia angustata is very rare in the California Miocene with only two specimens reported from the upper part of the "Vaqueros" Stage of Addicott (1972). The scarcity of Aturia in California in the early Miocene cannot be explained by cooling because the "Vaqueros" molluscan fauna is subtropical to tropical. Nautilus, the only living relative of Aturia, lives today in the South Pacific, mostly near islands with shallow water near shore and nearby steep continental shelves where depths drop off rapidly to 600 meters or more. Aturia probably lived in similar geographic areas in the early Miocene, and its scarcity in California may be related to the absence of habitats with shallow water close to deep water. In addition, other ''Vaqueros'' faunas generally represent shallower water than the common depth for Aturia of 100-350 meters (Moore, 1984). Nevertheless, the worldwide extinction of Aturia probably is related to the middle Miocene global cooling event.
Some of the mollusks common to the Pillarian and Newportian Stages, and about equally abundant in both, are Ficus modesta (Conrad) (pl. 4, fig. 2), Cyclocardia subtenta (Conrad) (pl. 3, fig. 16), Lucinoma acutilineata (Conrad) (pl. 3, fig. 8), Katherinella (Katherinella) angustifrons (Conrad) (pl. 3, figs. 2, 10, 14), Macoma albaria (Conrad) (pl. 3, fig. 7), and Saccella amelga Moore (pl. 4, figs. 4, 6).
On the basis of peak occurrences of key species, we believe that the unnamed Miocene sediments at Coos Bay, Ore., and the type section of the Narrow Cape Formation, on Kodiak Island, Alaska, represent the late early Miocene part of the Newportian and that units II and III of the Astoria Formation in southwestern Washington (Wolfe and McKee, 1972) and the Astoria Formation in the Newport embayment, Oregon, represent the early middle Miocene part of the Newportian.

A New Species of lsogramma (Brachiopoda) From the Pennsylvanian of North-Central Texas

By Bruce R. Wardlaw, David E. SchindeP, and Ellis L. Yochelson

Abstract
lsogramma coopi, new species, is described from the Gonzales Limestone Member of the Graham Formation (Pennsylvanian) of north-central Texas. It is interpreted as having lived in a coralgal patch attached to corals and other hard substrate with its anterior commissure vertical. The lsogrammidae are transferred to the order Strophomenida.
INTRODUCTION
lsogramma has long been known from its distinctive shell fragments and has been reported from several localities and stratigraphic levels in the Pennsylvanian of north-central Texas. Several new, whole specimens of lsogramma coopi n. sp. were collected in apparent life position by the authors during summer 1976 and 1977 from the Gonzales Limestone Member of the Graham Formation, Cisco Group (Upper Pennsylvanian, Virgillian). These collections represent the only ones with abundant, whole, articulated specimens. None has been reported or illustrated. The collections provide an opportunity to reassess the genus lsogramma and its taxonomic position.
I. coopi is found in the Gonzales Limestone Member exposed in the bluffs and gullies approximately 200 meters east-northeast of the Mt. Zion Cemetery on the La Casa quadrangle, Stephens County, Tex. (fig. 1). This limestone caps an 8.5-m bluff of richly fossiliferous, medium-lightgray marine mudstone in the Finis Shale Member of the Graham Formation. Additional exposures occur in gullies approximately 150 m east of the cemetery, roughly 8 m stratigraphically below the sandstone on which the cemetery is built.

continues along strike virtually unchanged in composition or thickness for 11 km to the north-northeast and for 8 km to the south of the Mt. Zion Cemetery before pinching out. Beyond this limited lateral extent, the underlying Finis Shale Member and the overlying Gonzales Shale Member, both of Sellards, Adkins, and Plummer (1933), form an undivided shale sequence. The Gonzales Limestone is identified and mapped in other areas of north-central Texas primarily on the basis of its relative position in the stratigraphic sequence. The composition and thickness of limestone are markedly different in those other areas. Thus, the correlation between the several limestone bodies called Gonzales is not precise; these lentils may or may not be time equivalents. No evidence from field observations indicates that the Gonzales Limestone Member was at one time laterally persistent throughout north-central Texas and was subsequently limited in extent by erosion. It is more easily demonstrated that conditions under which this unit was de-

posited differed among areas that were separated by regions of clastic deposition in which limestone was prevented from forming.
The fauna of the Gonzales Limestone Member of central Stephens County is dominated by abundant solitary rugose corals. These lophophyllidioid corals are laterally compressed, and some reach lengths exceeding 6 centimeters. They shed conspicuously as yellow-tan debris onto the slopes of the Finis Shale Member below. Individual corals are found in situ, generally with apex lowermost, in positions ranging from upright to recumbent. Most specimens grow with straight axes, or with only slight curvature, suggesting that excavation and toppling of individuals by excessive water movement was not common. Algae and ectoprocts occurring as epibionts on the outer surfaces of the corals indicate shallow, gently agitated, normal marine conditions. Occurrence of a range of coral growth stages in life position strongly suggests lack of faunal mixing or winnowing, although the presence of clay in the Gonzales Limestone indicates sufficient current action for the influx of very fine clastic particles. These clay-sized particles probably settled quickly to the bottom as a result of the wave-damping effect on the coral cover.
Other constituents of the fauna in the Gonzales Limestone Member at the Mt. Zion Cemetery include colonial Syringopora corals, crinoid stems, the high-spired gastropod Taosia, robust spiriferoid brachiopods, Isogramma coopi, rare specimens of Enteletes, and infaunal pelecypods belonging to the genera Astartella, Schizodus, and Allorisma. All bivalved taxa are represented by at least a few articulated, unabraded specimens. Crinoid columnals remain articulated in lengths up to 10 em; many of these stems are encrusted and bleached lengthwise along one side, indicating an interval of post-mortem, preburial response on the bottom. These observations support the suggestion that this 20-km-long lentil of the Gonzales Limestone Member was deposited in a shallow, gently agitated, normal marine setting. This local limestone probably represents the growth of a meadowlike patch, densely carpeted by a coral-dominated assemblage, analogous to modem Thallassia-dominated subtidal meadows of the Caribbean.
Transition from the preexisting mud-bottom condition of Finis Shale Member deposition to the shelly-bottom condition under which the overlying Gonzales Limestone Member accumulated seems geologically rapid; the diverse mollusk-dominated fauna of the Finis Shale Member is replaced vertically by the coral-dominated assemblage within a few centimeters of strata. Rugose corals were not found in the underlying Finis, although extensive collecting from the weathered slopes of this unit has yielded a few lophophyllidioid corals, all of which are laterally crushed and stained yellow tan. We believe that these individuals originated in the Gonzales, as no rugosans have been found in situ below this unit. A vertical sequence of bulk sediment samples taken through the entire Finis Shale at the Mt. Zion Ceme-

tery was disaggregated and wet-sieved for fossils above the 200 mesh fraction (0.074 millimeter and larger). These 24 samples represented more than 60 kilograms of sediment and produced thousands of specimens greater than 1.0 mm; however, not a single coral adult, protocorallium, or fragment was among them (Schindel, 1979).
The presence of clay in the Gonzales Limestone Member shows that influx of terrigenous clastics did not cease before the growth of the coral thicket, though turbidity may have decreased to a level tolerable to the corals. Although we cannot demonstrate that environmental conditions changed at or near the level of faunal replacement, it is apparent that rugose corals were not pr~sent in the area before Gonzales deposition. We suggest that the initial arrival of coral colonists was the first step in the change from a quiet-water, mud-bottom environment, dominated by low-level depositand suspension-feeding mollusks, to a very quiet-water, wave-damped shelly bottom environment, dominated by epifaunal grazers and by filter-feeders, including/. coopi.
ISOGRAMMIDAE
Currently (Rowell, 1965, p. 359), the Isogrammidae are associated with the Eichwaldiidae in the superfamily Eichwaldiacea. Megapleuronia Cooper (1952) and its junior synonym, Schizopleuronia Liao (1983), are the only other genera included in the Isogrammidae. Megapleuronia is differentiated from /sogramma by its costate or plicated anterior margins. All other features are similar to Isogramma . The common features of the Isogrammidae and · Eichwaldiidae are shell punctation and a pedicle plate (urnbona! plate of Rowell, 1965). The Eichwaldiidae have an opening at the anterior end of the pedicle place communicating to the outside of the valve. This also results in an interior raised posterior plate in the pedicle valve anterior to the opening to the pedicle plate. This opening to the pedicle plate has been postulated for the Isogrammidae (Dittmar, 1872; Schmidt, 1931), but we find no evidence for it in our specimens or in those illustrated by Cooper (1952) or Cooper and Grant (1974).
The Isogrammidae differ from the Eichwaldiidae in having no teeth, a lophophore platform, and articulation achieved by a prominent trilobate cardinal process extending posterior to the hingeline as in the Productidina. Isogramma has a lophophore platform (brachial ridges? of Cooper and Grant, 1974) that is diagnostic of Strophomenida. The valve shape and fit of the Isogrammidae are like that of the Strophomenida, whereas the Eichwaldiidae valve shape and fit are more like the Rhynchonellida. The Isogrammidae occur in Carboniferous and Permian rocks, and the Eichwaldiidae are found in Ordovician and Silurian rocks, a significant hiatus between occurrences.
The punctation and shell structure found in the Isogrammidae differ from that of most brachiopods. The punctae are large and occupy as much space as the intervening shell.

The ridges of shell coalesce to form the exterior ornamentation of concentric ridges ; these ridges can cover the entire valve, as reported by Cooper and Grant (1974) or can leave interridge areas exposing punctae to the exterior (fig. 2; Schmidt, 1931) . Interior impunctate shell material forms the cardinal process , shaft , and long median septum. Similar impunctate shell is deposited to form the pedicle plate, with no punctate layer deposited over it. The pedicle plate narrows and ends at or near the posterior end of the beak and does not have an anterior opening to communicate with the exterior. The delthyrium of the pedicle valve is filled with the cardinal process of the brachial valve. It is hard to imagine how any pedicle could have been extended from

this shell. The pedicle plate is not covered by the external shell layers of the punctate shell and concentric ridges but appears internal to these layers. Because the pedicle plate is composed of impunctate shell material like some internal features that were covered by living mantle tissue and because it is internal to the normal punctate shell forming the exterior, perhaps it, too, was covered by living tissue. The pedicle plate, therefore, was probably not a "pedicle track" but may have been a specialized attachment surface. Communication to the interior may be maintained through the bordering punctae along the margin of the pedicle plate. These punctae appear to be the only "openings" available to the pedicle plate. Nevertheless, /sogramma has a different

attachment than members of the Eichwaldiidae which do have an obvious "pedicle track" and an obvious pedicle opening to the exterior at the anterior of the "track" and probably had a pedicle.
The Isogrammidae developed during the explosive radiation of the Strophomenida; they are articulated like the Productidina of the Strophomenida. Though the shell structure is aberrant for a member of the Strophomenida, the Strophomenida being pseudopunctate, or rare!y impunctate, all other features support a relationship with that order. This argument is not new; Schmidt (1931) also discussed this possible affinity. Modification of hollow taleolae, as in the Chonetidina, could lead to the shells of the Isogrammidae. The Stropheminida include the Oldhaminidina and many strange Productidina. In our view, the Isogrammidae can fit comfortably in the order without unduly extending its limits.

giving the overall impression of concentric ornament; ridges start at and perpendicular to hinge, ridges forming wavy ornamentation at various points on valve; punctae exposed in interridge areas, interridge areas approximately one-half the width of ridges; concentric ornament interrupted by narrow triangular pedicle plate, starting near posterior of beak and extending anteriorly for a variable distance commonly about one-third to one-half the length of valve; pedicle plate is notched in middle.
Pedicle valve interior rarely observed, with deep, troughlike posterior depression in middle of valve made up of impunctate shell representing interior of the pedicle plate, remainder of valve with radially arranged small ridges and depressions, anteriomedianly, representing muscle attachment or pallial marks. Brachial valve interior with thick, short, trilobate cardinal process supported by a thick shaft becoming a high median septum extending anteriorly nearly entire length of valve, all composed of impunctate shell; articulation accomplished by inner "socket" ridge that forms shallow groove to hinge, groove receives thickened margin of pedicle valve interarea; cardinal process completely fills delthyrium; muscle scars consisting of radially arranged ridges and depressions forming large triangular areas anteriormedianly, posterior one-third of muscle scars depressed, anteriorly muscle scars elevated; lophophore platform simple, outlined by low "socket" ridge posteriorly and low ridge laterally and anteriorly, forming symmetric wings, narrowing medianly about the posterior shaft and median septum (fig. 3). Brachial valve interior surface marked by numerous pits (punctae).
Discussion. -The pedicle plate has no direct connection to the interior of the brachiopod and, thus, probably does not represent a "pedicle track" (Cooper and Grant, 1974). It is composed of impunctate shell material, which in the brachial valve, represents inner shell. This implies that impunctate shell is secreted by mantle inside the mantle-shell margin where normal (punctate) shell deposition takes place. Because, in Isogramma, the impunctate shell appears to represent "inner" shell material that was probably secreted by covering mantle tissue, the inner shell exposed in the pedicle plate may have been covered by mantle. The pedicle plate seems to have been involved in attachment, and commonly corals are cemented to it. This cementation appears postdepositional, but the proximity of the fossils seems original. No evidence exists that /sogramma could cement itself to a substrate. However, the proximity of possible attachment objects implies attachment, and this may have been accomplished by a living attachment surface of exposed mantle. The occurrence of/. coopi in upright life position within a coral thicket also suggests some attachment. Communication to the interior for the live exposed mantle is difficult to demonstrate, but access could be through the open punctae bordering the pedicle plate. Mantle tissue probably existed in all the punctae, at least sometime during the brachiopod's life. The mantle in the

punctae bordering the pedicle plate was probably specialized and extended to cover the plate, which prevented outer shell development and made an attachment surface during life.
Isogramma coopi differs from /. renfrarum Cooper (1952), which occurs in the Finis Shale Member in northcentral Texas, in its smaller size, oval shape, and folding on brachial valve. This difference may be due to different living environments-/. renfrarum occurred on marine mudflats, and/. coopi, in a coralgal thicket. The folding in/. coopi may have been a response for sharper separation of incoming and outgoing currents in a crowded environment.
In its anterior folding, Isogramma coopi most closely resembles/. lobatum Cooper and Grant from the Leonardian (late Early Permian) of west Texas, though the folding is less pronounced in /. coopi. I. coopi differs internally in having a different-shaped lophophore platform and in having radial ornament confined to the muscle scars./. lobatum is based on only two brachial valves, so further comparison is precluded.
Occurrence. -Gonzales Limestone Member of the Graham Formation (Upper Pennsylvania, Virgilian), Mt. Zion Cemetery, Stephens County, Texas.

Middle and Upper Triassic Marine Ostracoda From the Shublik Formation, Northeastern Alaska
By I. G. Sohn

Abstract
Twenty-two taxa from beds dated by megafossils as Ladinian through Norian are described and illustrated in 7 new species, 13 in open nomenclature, and 1 as Gen. and sp. indet. The
Hungarella-Ogmoconcha problem is discussed, and specimens of Ogmoconcha from the Carnian of Hungary are illus-
trated as evidence that the genus was present during the Triassic. Twelve of the taxa are restricted to the Ladinian part of the Shublik Formation of the reference section, one taxon is restricted to the Carnian, and six taxa are restricted to the Norian. Related genera have been recorded from the Middle Triassic of the Primor'ye Zoogeographical Province of the Pacific Realm and from the Middle and Upper Triassic in the Tethyan Zoogeographical Province of Eurasia.
The following taxa are included: Cavussurella grammi n. sp., C.? sp. 1, C.? sp. 2, Covracytheridae n. fam., Covracythere binoda n. sp., C. gryci n. sp., Dettermania truncata n. gen., n. sp., Ogmoconcha tailleuri n. sp., 0. unicerata n. sp., 0. a/askaense. n. sp., 0. marquardti n. sp., 0 .? sp. aff. Hungarella limbata (Reuss, 1868), 0. aff. 0. owthropensis (Anderson, 1964), Cavussure/la? sp. 1, C?. sp. 2, "Healdia" sp. 1, "H" sp. 2, "H" sp. 3, Hyatobairdia? ex gr. H. arcuata KristanTollman, 1970, Recytella sp. 1, R. sp. 2, Triassocypris? sp., Pseudobythocypris? sp. Rhombocythere? sp., and Gen. and sp.
indet.
In addition, Cornutobairdia reidae n. sp. from the Lewes
River Formation (Norian), Yukon Territory, Canada, is described. This species is representative of an abundant and varied silicified ostracode assemblage that differs on the generic level from those in northern Alaska. This assemblage is similar to ostracodes from Nevada and to taxa described from the Carnian and Rhaetian of the Tethyan Zoogeographical Region. During the Middle Triassic (Anisian and Ladinian), the sea that became northern Alaska was located in the Primor'ye Zoogeographical Province not directly connected with the Tethyan Zoogeographical Region. During the Late Triassic (Norian and ?Rhaetian), that sea had connections with the Tethyan Zoogeographical Province of Eurasia. Northern Alaska is not one of the accretionary exotic terranes postulated for western North America and southern Alaska.

INTRODUCTION
Purpose and Scope
The discovery and production of oil in the North Slope of Alaska involved detailed geologic, stratigraphic, and paleontologic studies by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) and many private companies. This report deals with Middle and Late Triassic ostracodes from the reference section of the Shublik Formation, 10.4 kilometers N83°W of the confluence of Fire Creek and the Sadlerochit River (fig. 1) in the Mount Michelson quadrangle (Detterman and others, 1975, p. 14-16, fig. 6). Stage assignments for the units in this reference section are based on megafossils identified by N. J. Silberling (Detterman and others, 1975, p. 43). Because ostracodes also are present in boreholes in the North Slope (Sohn, 1984a, p. 334), description of the ostracodes from surface collections makes these microfossils available for surface and subsurface identification.
Previous Work
From 1857 through 1966, only 25 publications dealing with marine Triassic ostracodes were published (Sohn, 1968, p. 6, 64), and all were from Europe and Asia. During the past two decades, the number of publications on the Triassic ostracodes from Europe and Asia has increased dramatically. Sohn (1965) recorded Hungarella? spp., Paracypris? spp., Darwinula? sp., and unidentified steinkems in 30 collections of very poorly preserved pyritized ostracodes from the Shublik Formation on Dodo Creek about 10 km east-northeast of the Fire Creek reference section. In the same publication, the following taxa were recorded for silicified ostracodes from the Grantsville Formation (Ladinian), Shoshone Mountains, Nye County, Nev. (USGS Mesozoic loc. M76): Acratia? sp., Carinobairdia? sp., Cytherelloidea n. sp. 1, Cytherelloidea n. sp. 2, new genus Thlipsuracea?, Gen. indet. Beyrichicopina?, Gen. indet. Cytheracea, and Gen. indet. Healdiidae.

Middle And Upper Triassic Marine Ostracoda, Northeastern Alaska Cl

Harlan Bergquist gave me 37 slides with ostracodes he found while studying the foraminifers from the Fire Creek reference section of the Shublik Formation for R. L. Detterman. In 1973, I reported that they contained Hungarella spp., Bairdia sp. (one carapace), and steinkerns of undetermined genera. As result of my report, Detterman sent me 88 samples from the reference section of the Shublik Formation that had been prepared by grinding for mineralogical studies. Sixty-one of these contained ostracodes. Both suites of samples from the reference section were documented by collection numbers and by distances measured in feet above the base of the Shublik Formation. These samples were small, ranging in dry weight from 22 to 104 grams; the ostracodes recovered, which varied from 1 to more than 30 specimens per sample, provided the ostracodes for this study.
Acknowledgments
I thank the following colleagues in the Geological Survey for specimens, information, and advice: Jean M. Berdan, R. L. Detterman, J. T. Dutro, Jr., George Gryc, N.J. Silberling, I. L. Tailleur, and the late Harlan Bergquist. Kathleen M. Flynn, October 1981 to May 1982, Jane A. Bubek, June 1982 to August 1982, and T. Chad Walter, October 1982 to April 1984, processed and picked the samples, and Marija Balanc assisted with translations from the Russian. Pamela Reid, University of Miami, Florida, supplied etched residue

and limestone samples from the Lime Peak Formation (Norian), Yukon, Canada. Dr. M. N. Gramm, Vladivostok, U.S.S.R. , compared scanning electron micrographs of two taxa with the types and duplicates of taxa he had described from the Primor'ye Territory, U.S.S.R. The National Petroleum Reserve in Alaska provided technical support during fiscal years 1982 and 1983 to process these samples, as well as portions of borehole cores that I selected in Menlo Park during January 26 and 27, 1982.
Preservation and Laboratory Techniques
All the samples were treated in Quaternary-0, sieved and picked using a binocular microscope. Selected specimens were prepared for scanning electron microscope (SEM) photomicrography. Both methods have been described by Sohn (1983. p. 10).
Because the samples had been crushed previously, most of the ostracodes are either steinkerns or broken or corroded carapaces and are small, from 0.4 to 0.8 millimeter in greatest length. Clean dissociated valves are rare. The outer surfaces of many of the carapaces, particularly those taxa with smooth surfaces. are rough because they are coated with an as yet undetermined mineral (pl. 6, figs. 15-18). Some have adhering mineral grains (pl. 6, figs. 6-9), and others are pitted and gouged (pl. 9, figs. 15, 18). On some of the steinkerns and broken carapaces, either the hinge structure or the adductor muscle-attachment scar is exposed

(pl. L figs. 7, 8. 15, 16. 18. 20; pl. 5, figs. 14, 16; pl. 8, figs. 25. 26; pl. 9. figs. 11, 12, 22, 23; pl. 10. figs. 18, 19, 26; pl. 11, fig. 26). These two morphologic characters are particularly important in the generic and suprageneric classification of ostracodes.
GEOLOGIC SETTING
Current interpretations suggest that modern-day Alaska is composed of at least two unrelated blocks: A northern segment consisting of the North Slope and the Brooks Range that was once connected to the Canadian Arctic Islands (Grantz. Johnson, and Sweeny, 1982, pl. Ill) and a central and southern portion composed of accretionary terranes that are part of the active convergent Pacific microplates (Jones, Silberling, and Hillhouse, 1978, p. 71-74; Plafker and Jones, 1982. p. 78, fig. I). The Brooks Range and the Canada Basin may have formed simultaneously during the Late Jurassic or Early Cretaceous by the counterclockwise rotation of Arctic Alaska (Mull, 1984; Tozer 1982, p. 1085). Several studies, however, suggest no post-Triassic rotation (Churkin. 1972; Churkin and Trexler, 1981; Dutro, 1981). The affinities of the ostracodes, on the generic level, to those in the Primor'ye Territory support the latter view.
With one exception. Cornutobairdia reidae n. sp., from the Lewes River Formation (Norian), Yukon Territory, Canada, the ostracodes described herein are from the Shublik Formation in the northern segment of Alaska. The distinctive lithology, namely thin-bedded black phosphatic limestone and dolomite, shale and chert. and abundant fossils. make the Shublik Formation a readily recognized stratigraphic unit in northern Alaska. This formation represents a condensed sequence of rock of remarkably uniform thickness. Detterman and others ( 1975, p. 14-16) designated the Fire Creek outcrop section as the reference section of the Shublik Formation. They described the distribution of the formation and the stratigraphic relations, lithology, and age based on megafossils of the section. C. reidae is included to indicate that the accretionary terranes may contain entirely different Triassic ostracode assemblages.
Age of the Ostracodes
Silberling (Detterman and others, 1975, p. 15, fig. 6; p. 43) recorded Daonellaframi Kittl and Leiophyllites sp. in the basal siltstone member of the Shublik Formation at the reference section. USGS colin. M6052, collected from 8.2 to 21.9 meters (27-72 feet) above the base of the Shublik Formation, indicates an Anisian or Ladinian age. Only a small carapace of Ogmoconcha tailleuri (USNM 389916) was recovered from the siltstone member of the Shublik Formation at 25.9 m (85 ft) above the base of the Shublik Formation (USGS colln. 33106).
The lower part of the overlying limestone and dolomite member of the Shublik Formation yielded most of the ostra-

codes. The majority occurred from approximately 30 to 70 m (100-235 ft) above the base of the formation. Based on the megafossils, this interval is Ladinian in age. USGS colin. M6054 from the limestone and dolomite member, 30.5 m (100 ft) above the base of the Shublik Formation, contains Daonella frami Kittl, and USGS colln. M6053 in the same member, 30.5 to 33.5 m (100-110 ft) above the base of the Shublik Formation, contains D.frami, Lima sp., Camptonectes sp., and spiriferoid brachiopods; these indicate a Ladinian age for this interval. Only three ostracode taxa, Covracythere gryci n. sp., 0. sp. aff. 0. owthropensis (Anderson, 1964), and 0. tailleuri n. sp. extend above this interval into the Norian. The ostracodes from 30.5 to 70 m (100-230 ft) must be Ladinian because of the associated megafossils.
The middle part of the section, the limestone member of the Shublik Formation, from approximately 69 m (225 ft) to approximately 97 m (320 ft) above the base of the Shublik Formation is Carnian in age. Silberling (Detterman and others, 1975, p. 15, fig. 6, p. 43) recorded the following Carnian megafossils from USGS colln. M6056, from 68.6 to 71.6 m (225-235 ft) above the base of the Shublik Formation in the limestone member: Halobia cf. H. zitteli Lindstrom, Leptochondria nationalis Smith, Gryphea sp., Lima sp. , arcetid ammonites, rhynchonellid brachiopods, and gastropods. In USGS colln. M6057, from about 74 to 97 m (245-320 ft) Silberling recorded the following Carnian megafossils: Halobia cf. H. zitteli Lindstrom, H. ornatissima, and Sirenites sp. Only Pseudobythocypris? sp. is restricted to this interval.
The overlying clay shale member of the Shublik Formation, from approximately 106 to 145.5 m (350-477 ft) above the base of the Shublik Formation is Norian in age based on the megafossils from the upper part of this member, from about 127m (420ft) above the base of the Shublik Formation. Siberling (Detterman and others, 1975, p. 16, 45) recorded the following megafossils in USGS collns. M6058, M6059, and M6067: Halobia cf. H. fallax Mojsisovics, H. cf. H. lineata Mojsisovics, Monotis scutiformis pinensis Westermann, M. cf. M. scutiformis Westermann, M. cf. M. obtusicostata, Gryphea sp. and rhynchonellid brachiopods. Of the eight ostracode taxa recovered from the Norian, Ogmoconcha marquardti n. sp., 0. alaskaense n. sp., Hiatobairdia? sp. ex gr. H. arcuata Kristan-Tollmann, 1970, Triassocypris? sp., and Gen. and sp. indet. are confined to this unit; the other three taxa extend upward from the Ladinian.
The Triassic ostracodes described from northeastern Alaska are new species, taxa tentatively referred to related or known Triassic species, or undescribed species discussed and illustrated in open nomenclature. Except for Dettermania n. gen., Ogmoconcha Triebel, 1941 [originally described from the Liassic (Lower Jurassic)], and Pseudobythocypris Shaver, 1958 (previously known from the Paleozoic), all the taxa are related to genera known from the

Primor'ye Province from the Pacific Ocean Zoogeographical Region (Burij and Zharnikova, 1977, p. 90-92) or from the Tethyan Zoogeographical Region, as shown in table 1.

Paleogeographic Implications
The affinity of the ostracodes in northeastern Alaska with those in the Primor'ye Territory (table 2) poses a paleogeographical problem. Tozer (1982) based a model for the Triassic paleogeography on plate tectonics, paleomagnetics, and paleontology. The upper map of Tozer (1982, p. 10941095, fig. 2) represents the Triassic, and the lower map as well as a large scale map (Tozer, 1982, p. 1083, fig. 1) show the current world geography. The paleogeographic model shows the paleopacific (Panthalassa) to contain scattered shoals and islands. Plate-bound areas on Tozer's maps of the present are shown to include northeastern Alaska, where the ostracodes were collected. The Triassic model shows the Primor'ye Territory as part of a midpaleolatitude, about 40°N. of the Triassic equator (Tozer, 1982, p. 1086),

volcanic terrane that later became part of Japan and part of Asia (Tozer, 1982, p. 1095, fig. 2, no. 18). Blome and Reed (oral commun. , 1984) reported that some of the Triassic radiolarians in the Brooks Range, Alaska, are related on the generic level to those in Japan.
A different model for the Triassic faunal relation was proposed by Kristan-Tollmann and Tollmann (1981, fig. 1; 1983, fig. 9). They considered the Triassic Pacific Ocean as a gigantic ocean without any islands in which a major paleocurrent, the "Tethys current," transported the Triassic fauna from the west coast of North America to the Mediterranean (Tethyan) Zoogeographical Province.
Neither model explains the similarity on the generic level of the ostracodes in northern Alaska to those in the Primor'ye Territory. A combination of the above models may explain more closely the similarities. Although Tozer (1982) did not discuss paleocurrents, currents in the Triassic certainly influenced the distribution of marine organisms (Choi, 1984, p. 731). If the paleocurrent patterns proposed by Kristan-Tollman and Tollmann (1981) were modified, reflecting the presence of the various islands and shoals, the

C4 Shorter Contributions to Paleontology and Stratigraphy

new model could explain the similarity on the generic level shown in table 2.
Burij and Zhamikova (1977) used the Jaccard coefficient in the analysis of Triassic ammonite genera to determine paleozoogeographic provinces. They distinguished two latitudinal zoogeographic provinces in the northern Pacific Basin: a northern, colder, Yakutian-Canadian (including northern Alaska) subregion in the Boreal Zone and a warmer Primor'ye-Californian subregion in the Equatorial Zone. During the early Middle Triassic (Anisian), the Yakutian province was connected closely with the Primor'ye province (Burij and Zhamikova, 1977, p. 102). During the Ladinian, the Yakutian and Canadian provinces (including northern Alaska) were interconnected (Burij and Zhamikova, 1977, p. 104). Paleocurrents during the Anisian could have distributed the Primor'ye taxa described by Gramm (1969a, b, 1970, 1975) into the Yakutian province, and, during the Ladinian, paleocurrents could have transported those taxa into the area of northeastern Alaska.
Environment of the Ostracodes
The genera to which the taxa in northeastern Alaska are assigned indicate a benthic life style, probably less than 200 min depth. Dutro (1981, p. 25) proposed that the Shublik Formation was deposited in relatively deep water far from shore. He based his conclusions on the fact that the sediments consist of thin-bedded phosphatic limestone, shale, and chert. According to Dutro, the Shublik Formation represents a comparatively long period of time in which very little sediment was deposited.
Burij and Zhamikova (1977) considered Alaska to be located in a Boreal Paleozoogeographical Province. The presence in Alaska of taxa related on the generic level (table 2 ) to forms originally described from Britain and northern Germany that were connected to the Boreal Sea (Fisher, 1984) supports their interpretation.
The ostracode assemblage in northeastern Alaska differs markedly on the generic level from the ostracodes in the Lewes River Formation (Norian), Yukon Territory, Canada. This formation contains Cornutobairdia reidae n. sp., described herein, and undescribed taxa tentatively referred to the following genera: Acratia Delo, 1930, Paleozoic through Upper Triassic; Alatobairdia Kristan-Tollmann, 1971b, Rhaetian; Bairdia McCoy, 1844, smooth type, Paleozoic through Holocene; Bairdiacypris Bradfield, 1935, Paleozoic through Rhaetian; Carinobairdia Kollmann, 1963, Norian through Rhaetian; Ceratobairdia Sohn, 1954 sensu Kristan-Tollman, 1970, Permian through Rhaetian; Leviella Sohn, 1968, Anisian through Rhaetian; Lobobairdia Kollmann, 1963, Norian through Rhaetian; Polycopsis Muller, 1894, Scythian through Holocene; Ptychobairdia Kollmann, 1960, Norian through Rhaetian; Vavilovella Kozur, 1973, Norian; and additional, as yet unidentified, taxa.

THE HUNGARELLA-OGMOCONCHA PROBLEM
TheHungarella-Ogmoconcha problem was created when Mehes (1911 , p. 21 , pl. 2. figs. 14-18) described Bairdia ? problematica and stated (p. 22) that if subsequent investigations determined that the species belonged to a new genus, that genus should be named in the literature as Hungarella. The original description of Bairdia? problematica (Mehes, 1911, p. 21, 22) stated that the valves were very well preserved and not thick, were completely glassy, and were transparent. The above description suggests a Holocene or Tertiary contamination, either in the field or in the laboratory, of some of the collections that Mehes studied.
Triebel (1941 , p. 377) described and illustrated with excellent photographs the genus Ogmoconcha from the Liassic of Germany. Shaver (Moore, 1961, p. Q161), van Morkhoven (1963, p. 132), and Anderson (1964, p. 146) considered Ogmoconcha to be a junior subjective synonym of Hungarella because conditional names, such as Hungarella, were declared valid according to Article 17(8) in the second edition of the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature [Stoll and others, 1961, p. 17; article 5lc (ii) of the third edition (International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature, 1985, p. 97)]. Sohn (1968, p. 28) discussed the differences between Ogmoconcha and Hungarella Mehes, 1911. Since that time, the Hungarella-Ogmoconcha problem has been discussed by Kozur (1970b, p. 20), Bolz (197lb, p. 156, 243), Malz (1971, p. 434), Lord (1972, p. 332; 1982, p. 262), Gerry and Kozur (1973, p. 67-69), Kristan-Tollmann (1977, p. 133, 142, 143), and Bate (1978, p. 186). Except for Lord (1972, p. 352), the above writers did not take into account the possibility that Mehes included younger contaminants in his faunule (Mandelstam, 1960, footnote p. 292; Sohn, 1968, p. 39; Tappan, 1951, p. 7; Vadasz, 1933, p. 173). Lord (1982, p. 262) considered the relationship of Ogmoconcha and Hungarella to be unresolved until topotype material of Hungarella would be restudied and reillustrated.
The basic problem involves the presence or absence of a calcified inner lamella (duplicature), a denticulate hinge, and an aggregate, so-called healdiid, adductor muscle scar in Hungarella. An aggregate adductor muscle scar has been described in Ogmoconcha and also in the original and subsequent descriptions of Hungarella . Gerry and Kozur (1973, p. 67-69) reported that they examined a "cell" containing type material of Mehes (1911) at the Hungarian Geological Institute and noted the following regarding Hungarella "Bairdia"? problematica Mehes, 1911: "Syntype T685 AFL Ladinian, Felsors. Destroyed, some badly preserved fragments showing no calcified inner lamella. (Generotype of Hungarella! !)"
My experience with ostracode types (Zalanyi, 1959) at the Hungarian Geological Survey may provide a plausible explanation as to the condition of the types of Hungarella. I saw Zahinyi's Aptian types at the Hungarian Geological

Middle And Upper Triassic Marine Ostracoda, Northeastern Alaska C5

Institute, Budapest, on August 10, 1976. All the specimens were on one large, plastic, multicelled slide that was covered by similar material attached at the comers with tiny screws. The cover was inscribed with a grid covering each cavity so that the species in each cavity was identified by coordinates written in a notebook. I recognized in this multicelled slide that the specimen in the cavity identified as Metacypris aculeata Zalanyi, 1959, was not that species, and I saw many specimens, some crushed, that had moved into neighboring cavities with time and handling since Boda (1964) published his catalogue of Hungarian fossils. It is possible that the fragments examined by Gerry and Kozur (1973. p. 67, 69) in the Bairdia? problematica cavity may have had a similar history and belong to a different species, or they may represent different specimen than the one illustrated by Lord (1972, pl. 1, figs. la, b) with the same catalog number. Lord (1972, p. 321) stated that his illustration was provided by the Hungarian Geological Institute.
Hungarella? pricei Sohn, 1968, from the Ladinian of Israel, and Hungarella? sp. Sohn, 1970, from the Early Triassic of the Salt Range, West Pakistan, have calcified inner lamellas and denticulate hingements (Sohn, 1968, p. 29, pl. 2, figs. 28, 29, text fig. 3; 1970, p. 204, pl. 1, figs. 41, 42). Mehes (1911, p. 21) did not record a denticulate hinge in the type species, Bairdia? problematica , nor in the second taxon, B.? problematica var. reniformis. He did mention that two specimens of the variety reniformis have a strong ventroposterior spine. Kozur (1970a, p. 22, pl. 4, figs. 15-17) described and illustrated Healdia (Hungarella) reniformis (Mehes, 1911), from the Anisian and Ladinian of Hungary, and stated that the hinge is not denticulate ("Schlosselemente glatt").
Dr. 1. Fiilop, Director of the Hungarian Geological Survey, mailed me some washed samples from the Triassic of Hungary, including one from the Carnian marl that is equivalent to locality no. 5 of Mehes (USGS colln. 33172). He informed me (written commun., June 22, 1966) that it was (and still may be) impossible to collect at the localities studied by Mehes. Specimens with a posteroventral spine and a denticulated hinge are present in the collection, and one is illustrated herein as Ogmoconcha sp. (pl. 10, figs. 12, 13; Sohn, 1984b, fig. liE-G). Other specimens in the collection have thick valves and are opaque, and the adductor muscle scar could not be discerned even after treatment with hydrofluoric acid (pl. 11, figs. 13-16, 20--23).
A "healdiid" adductor muscle scar combined with a denticulate hinge were illustrated by Gramm (1982, p. 198, text figs. 6-8; pis. 2-5) for the Lower Carboniferous genus Healdianella Posner, 1951. Anderson (1970, fig. 1) and Sohn (1977, fig. lb; 1985, figs. 2.3, 2.7, 2.10, 2.14, 3.18) illustrated a similarly aggregate adductor muscle scar for the nonmarine genus Carbonita Strand, 1928, that does not have a denticulate hinge. The number of individual adductor muscle scars in the living Darwinula stevensoni (Brady and Robertson, 1870) is not related to growth stages and may
C6 Shorter Contributions to Paleontology and Stratigraphy

vary in opposite valves of the same individual (Sohn, 1976, p. 305). The "healdiid" adductor muscle scar is clearly developed in several different groups of Ostracoda; consequently, the "healdiid" pattern should not be used as the sole criterion for generic determination. To validate Hungarella Mehes, 1911, a neotype should be selected from the Hungarian Triassic, and the genus should be redefined, because, based on the present information, the taxon should be considered a nomen dubium.

Type species.-C. reticulata Kristan-Tollmann, 1970, p. 305, pl. 37, figs. 4-6. Rhaetian, "Plackles," Austria.
Original diagnosis (translated).-"Carapace elongated, strongly to moderately sculptured with three more or less elongated elements of which the two outer may join into a ring. The sculpture of both valves is different, in that the dorsal area of the left valve differs from the right; the left has additional strong sculpture, that expands into knobs and spines particularly in the posterodorsal area (compare generotype). In addition, the complete carapace is covered by a netforming pitted sculpture. The hinge is a simple, smooth bairdiid hinge terminated by numerous toothlets."
Discussion. -Kristan-Tollmann illustrated the type species with drawings of two carapaces that are dimorphic in width of dorsal and ventral outlines (1970, pl. 37), figs. 4a-d, 5a-d) and the hingement of a right valve (1970, pl. 37, figs. 61, b). She referred to C. reticulata a specimen from the same locality, illustrated by Kollmann as Triebelina sp./498 with photographs of the inside and outside of a right valve (Kollmann, 1963, 1979, pl. 8, figs. 11 , 13). Kristan-Tollmann (1970, p. 306) stated that the right valve illustrated in outside view by Kollmann (1963, p. 1979, pl. 8, fig. 12) as Triebelina sp. 158 represents an additional species in this genus and illustrated a juvenile left valve (Kristan-Tollmann, 1970, pl. 37, fig. 3a, b) as Cornutobairdia n. sp. from the Rhaetian Zlambachmergeln at Krautgartenalm, Austria. Kristan-Tollmann (1971b, p. 77, pl. 5, figs. 4, 5) referred the above specimen to C. trinodosa Kristan-Tollmann, 1971b. Bolz (1971a, p. 720) considered the above specimen as the A-3 stage of Triebelina sp./158 Kollmann, 1963, and illustrated a right valve of C. reticulata (Bolz, 1971b, p. 721, pl. 2, fig. 12). Bolz (1971a, p. 184, pl. 9, figs. 122-126, text fig. 24) considered Cornutobairdia a synonym of Triebelina and referred all the above taxa except C. trinodosa to Triebelina (Triebelina) reticulata (Kristan-Tollmann, 1970), republished his plate 2, figure 12 as plate 9, figure 124, and recorded the range of the species as Upper Norian- ?Liassic. Kozur (1972a, p. 652, pl. 2, fig. 2) republished Bolz's (1971b) plate 9, figure 122, as "Triebelina reticulata" and included Bolz's photograph on a plate illustrating a shallow neritic Upper Norian ostracode assemblage.
Bolz (1971a, p. 176-183) reviewed the literature on Triebelina van den Bold, 1964, and constructed a table showing characters of species in that genus. All the species of Tertiary to present ages, except Triebelina schulzi Hartmann, 1964, are from 0.59 to 0.75 mm in greatest length. The living T. schultzi Hartmann, 1964, is recorded to be 1.04 mm in greatest length, and the species is smooth (Hartmann, 1964, p. 44, pl. 4, fig. 14) and has a denticulated hinge (Hartmann, 1964, p. 45, pl. 4, figs. 20, 21); consequently, T. schulzi should not be classified with either Triebelina or Cornutobairdia. Van Morkhoven (1963, p. 35) recorded the length of species in Triebelina to be from

0.6 to 0. 9 mm. Specimens of Cornutobairdia are larger than 1.0 mm (Bolz, 1971b, text figs. 23, 24), and all the species described in the genus have a dorsoposterior hom on the larger valve or on both valves, a feature not recorded in Triebelina. Cornutobairdia, although related to Triebelina, is considered a valid genus for the above reasons. Combining the two taxa masks the stratigraphic utility of both genera.

Diagnosis.-Cornutobairdia with two subcentral nodes, dorsal margin of the larger valve with upward-trending spine near anterior and dorsolateral trending spine near posterior, minute spinelets on anterior and ventroposterior margins. Reversal of overlap and hingement present, but mostly left valve larger. Description.- The shells are heavily calcified, asymmetrical; larger valve overreaches the smaller along a straight dorsal hinge, overlaps slightly along the gently convex ventral margin. The surface of the larger valve bears a large node at or slightly below midheight in front of the greatest length of the hingeline and a second, smaller node located slightly higher than the subcentral node about equidistant from the hingeline and dorsoposterior margin. The dorsoposterior margin is obtuse, with about 130° angle from the posterior end of the hingeline, extends backward to about three-fourths of the height or below the posterior node, and then points to the rear to form a posterior spine; it then curves gently forward to meet the gently convex ventral margin.

the ventral and anterior margins and continues above the dorsal margins as a spine (pl. 3, figs. 2, 3, 6). From this spine, a straight, narrower ridge extends backwards to the posterior comer where it forms a posterolateral-pointing sharp spine. Above the dorsal ridge, the dorsal margin forms a pleatlike: ridge that bends inward to overreach the hingeline (pl. 3, figs. 2, 5).
The smaller valve has two nodes and a rounded rim along the ventral and anterior margins as well as along the posteroventral margin but lacks the dorsal spines and the pleatlike overreaching structure of the larger valve. The anterior and ventroposterior margins bear minute spinelets (pl. 3, figs. 4, 5). The duplicature is wide along the anterior margin, narrow or missing along the posterior margins on both valves.

Discussion.- The ostracodes are silicified, many are poorly preserved, and the adductor muscle scar is not observed. The marginal spines can be seen on the single valve (pl. 3, figs. 4, 5). This species is associated with specimens on which the subcentral nodes coalesce to form a ridge (USNM 389835, 389836) similar to those illustrated by Bolz (1971b, pl. 9, figs. 122-126) as Triebelina (Triebelina) reticulata (Kristan-Tollmann, 1970) = Cornutobairdia. A few specimens have three distinct nodes in a straight line, with or without the posterior node extending into a lateral spine (USNM 389836). These variants are not yet available in sufficient numbers for a population study to determine whether they represent one or more species. They are, however, distinct from C. reidae because the posterior node in the new species is located higher on the lateral surface than the subcentral node, and, on the variants, more than two nodes occur in a straight line.

Suborder unknown Superfamily unknown ?Family PARACYPRIDIDAE Sars, 1923 Genus TRIASSOCYPRIS Kozur, 1970 Type species.-Macrocypris? pusilla Kozur, 1968b, p. 500, pl. 2, figs. 14, 20-27. Lower and Middle Triassic, Thuringia. Diagnosis (translated).-"Carapace small, right valve larger than left; dorsal margin convex, not angled; posterior margin pointed; ventral margin almost straight. Shell surface smooth. Hinge adont. Calcified inner lamella and vestibule wide in front, otherwise narrow." Kozur assigned to this genus the holotype T. pusilla (Kozur, 1968b) and T. tenuis (Kozur, 1968b), both originally described as Macrocypris?. Discussion.-Kozur (1970b, p. 445) referred Triassocypris to the Paracyprididae. The Paracyprididae were defined in Moore (1961, p. Q245) as having a wide duplicature and large anterior and posterior vestibules. Triassocypris has a wide anterior and a narrow posterior vestibule and probably should not be classified in the Paracyprididae. Geolgoic range.- Triassic. Geographic distribution.-Known from Europe and, questionably, from northeastern Alaska.
Triassocypris? sp. Plate 11 , figures 1-4 Discussion.-The Upper Triassic specimen from Alaska is a poorly preserved carapace with most of the shell probably missing; consequently, the internal morphology of the valves is unknown. Because the specimen resembles Triassocypris in lateral outline, I am tentatively referring it to the genus.

Family COVRACYTHERIDAE n. fam. Diagnosis. -Small, less than 1 mm in length, elongated, with straight dorsal and gently convex ventral margins, with sulcus in front of midlength, two or more horizontal ribs that may or may not join at end margins, surface finely punctate or smooth. Hingement unknown, hingeline obscured by dorsal rib; overlap slight, left over right. Dimorphic in width of posterior. Discussion. -Gramm (1975) referred Covracythere and two additional Triassic genera to the subfamily Editinae Kniipfer, 1967, in the Bythocytheridae Sars, 1926. Although the nominate genus, Editia germanica Kniipfer, 1967, has a cytheracean adductor muscle-attachment scar, it has a well-developed eye tubercle that is not present in Covracythere nor the other genera referred herein to the new family. Except for the adductor muscle scar, the hingement and other internal morphology of Covracythere were unknown to Gramm (1975, p. 108) and are not known for the species in Alaska. When originally examined, the specimen illustrated on plate 7, figures 16-20, was tentatively referred to the Paleozoic family Beyrichiopsidae Sohn (Moore, 1961) because of the horizontal ribs (Sohn, 1984b, p. 21, fig. 111). SEM micrography, with the carapace tilted, disclosed the cast of the horizontal ribs on a specimen with a cytheracean adductor muscle scar (pl. 2, fig. 25), thus placing that specimen in the Cytheracea Baird, 1850. The specimens from the Triassic differ from Beyrichiopsis Jones and Kirkby, 1886, in lacking a marginal frill as shown by Sohn (Moore, 1961, p. Q183, fig. 6). The new family is established to include the nominate genus, Racvetina Gramm, 1975, Acvocarina Gramm, 1975, and, tentatively, Dettermania new genus because the aductor muscle scar of the new genus is unknown. Geologic range .-Known only from the Middle and Upper Triassic.
Genus COVRACYTHERE Gramm, 1975 Type species .-Covracythere kiparissovae Gramm, 1975, p. 108, pl. 1, figs. 23-27, 33. Middle Triassic, Primor'ye Territory. Original diagnosis (translated).-"Carapace small, nearly rectangular, with dorsal and ventral flattenings, and poorly defined transverse depression. Extremities rounded, the posterior narrower. Dorsal and ventral margins straight and parallel. Surface faintly pitted; a thin looplike ridge stretches along the anterior and ventral margins and the middle of the surface (parallel to dorsal margin). Adductor muscle scar comprises five elongate, obliquely directed spots juxtaposed in a vertical row. "Assigned species: Only the type species." Discussion .-Gramm's illustration of the adductor muscle-attachment scar (1975, pl. 1, fig. 33) is identical to those illustrated on the species from Alaska (pl. 2, figs. 20-26).

Paratypes .-USNM 389817, 389822, 389823, 389825389828, ?389829, ?389940. Type level.-Ladinian, from 36.4 to 37.9 m above base of Shublick, Formation. Other levels.-Norian, from 143.9 to 144.5 m above base of Shublik Formation. Diagnosis .-Covracythere with three horizontal ribs, lower two ribs joined to form elongated ellipse, middle rib unbroken across subcentral sulcus, surface finely pitted. Description.- The carapace is elongated, the greatest length is above midheight, about twice the greatest height; the greatest width is in the posterior quarter of the greatest length. The ends are rounded, the posterior margin meets the convex ventral margin slightly higher than it does the anterior margin. The sulcus is deep, concave towards the anterior, located in the front part of the central one-third of the greatest length. The adductor muscle-attachment scar consists of a vertical row of five scars concave towards the anterior and is located on the anterior wall of the sulcus. The dorsoanterior part of the sulcus curves forward above the central horizontal rib to outline a low rounded node on the interior of the valve (pl. 2, figs. 21, 23-25; pl. 7, fig. 24). The lower two horizontal ribs are joined at the ends to form an ellipse, the lower rib is located just below the bottom of the sulcus, and the middle rib crosses the sulcus (pl. 7, figs. 17, 19).

Covracythere binoda Sohn, n. sp. Plate 7, figures 1-3
Etymology of name.- Two small nodes in front of sulcus on each silde of the second rib.
Holotype.-Left valve, USNM 389818. Type level.-Ladinian, from 36.4 to 37.9 m above the base of Shublik Formation. Type locality.-Fire Creek section, Mount Michelson quadrangle, Alaska. USGS Mesozoic colin. 33111. Diagnosis.-Covracythere with four horizontal ribs, elongated posterior-trending sulcus below first to above third rib, and two small nodes in front of sulcus on each side of second rib. Description.- The valve is subquadrate, the dorsal and ventral margins are straight, the anterior margin is evenly rounded, the anterior is probably straight in the dorsal twothirds and probably truncated towards the venter. The dorsal rib is connected to the second rib, subparallel and slightly removed from the anterior margin, the second rib is connected to the third rib near the posterior margin, and the fourth rib is convex ventrad and connected to the anterior of the third rib. A straight sulcus extends backward from below the first rib to above the third rib. Two small rounded nodes are located on each side of the third rib in front of the sulcus. The second rib is broken by the sulcus. Discussion.- Although only a single left valve is available, it is formally described because it differs from the known taxa in the genus by having two nodes. Measurements (in mm).-USNM 389818, greatest length 0. 50, greatest height 0. 30. Geologic range.- Known only from the Ladinian part of the Shublik Formation, from 36.4 to 37.9 m (120-125 ft) above the base of the Shublik Formation.
Genus DETTERMANIA n. gen. Type species.-D. truncata n. sp. Etymology of name.-In honor of my colleague R. L. Detterman, U.S. Geological Survey, who collected the samples. Diagnosis.-Small, greatest length less than 1 mm. Straightbacked; sulcate, with anterocentral node anterior to sulcus. Smooth or finely punctate; with two or more horizontal ribs; dorsum flat, dorsal margin straight, ventral margin convex, rounded anterior margin and pointed posterior margin. Left over right overlap slight, dimorphic in width of posterior. Hingement and adductor muscle scar unknown. Discussion.- This genus differs from Covracythere Gramm, 1975, described from the Upper Anisian in the Soviet Far East and present also in Alaska, in lateral outline

and in having a subcentral node in front of the sulcus. Species assigned.-D. truncata n. sp. and
?Monoceratina subtriangulata Huang and Gou, 1977 (Ye and others, 1977) from the Norian of Yunnan, The People's Republic of China (P.R.C.).

Dettermania truncata Sohn, n. sp. Plate 7, figures 4-15
New genus, n. sp. Sohn, 1984b, p. 21, fig. III. Etymology of name.- Truncated posterior. Holotype.-Heteromorph, USNM 389820. Paratypes.- USNM 389819, 389821. Type level.-Ladinian, from 37.9 to 39.4 m above base
of Shublik Formation. Type locality.-Fire Creek section, Mount Michelson
quadrangle. USGS Mesozoic colln. 33112. Diagnosis.-Dettermania with four ribs, second rib from
top weakly developed; straight dorsal margin, convex ventral margin curving sharply backwards to form acute posterior margin, anterior margin evenly rounded. Sulcus wide, shallow, posterior to low rounded node extending from the third, strongest rib to level of weak second rib; fourth rib weaker than first. Dimorphic in width of posterior.
Description.- The shell is relatively thick as illustrated in plate 7, figure 4. The hinge margin is straight, the dorsum is flat, bounded by the straight dorsal rib. The ventral margin is convex, curves roundly into the anterior margin, and bends backward and upwards below the approximate posterior end of the third, strongest rib. A shallow, wide sulcus extends from below the dorsal rib to the third, best developed rib. This sulcus curves towards the anterior to delineate a subround node that extends upwards to the elevation of the very faint second rib (pl. 7, figs. 9-11).
Measurements (in mm).-USNM 389820, greatest length 0.43+, greatest height 0.5+; USNM 389819, greatest length 0.75+, greatest height 0.39+; USNM 389821, greatest length 0.98, greatest height 0.42.
Discussion.- This species is dimorphic in width of posterior. Plate 7, figure 9, illustrates the heteromorph which has a relatively wider posterior than the tecnomorph that is shown on plate 7, figure 14.
In lateral outline the species resembles Monoceratina subtriangulata Huang and Gou, 1977 (Ye and others, 1977, p. 282, pl. 1, fig. 21), from the Upper Triassic Shizhongshan Formation of Jinchuan, Yunnan, P.R.C. Although that species was described as having only one ventral rib, the original illustration shows also a dorsal rib and a deep subcentral sulcus; consequently, M. subtriangulata is questionably referred to Dettermania.
Geologic range.-Known only from the Ladinian, from 37.9 to 39.4 m (125-130 ft) above the base of the Shublik Formation.

Type species.-Rhombocythere wicheri Anderson, 1964, p. 138, pl. 9, figs. 1-8. Lower Rhaetian, borehole, Germany.
Original diagnosis.-'' Medium sized oblong-ovate carapace, smooth or with close small circular puncta set in wide shallow depressions. Normal pore canals open into the punctae frequently in pairs. Anterior and posterior margins flanged. Dorsal and ventral margins carinate. Venter flattened. Hinge straight, long and sunk. Dentition of Hemicythere type. In the left valve a crenulate bar terminates anteriorly in a small undivided tooth in front in which is a deep socket. A similar socket occupies the postero-dorsal angle. In the right valve a shallow socketted groove is succeeded anteriorly and posteriorly by large anvil-shaped teeth. Lamella free and wide, radial pore canals straight and widely spaced. General shape like Camptocythere. Left valve larger.''
Discussion.-In addition to the type species, Anderson (1964) described and illustrated R. ruegeri and R. schotti. He based the holotypes of the three species on specimens originally illustrated in open nomenclature by Wieber (1951) from Lower Rhaetian cores in boreholes, Germany. In addition, Anderson (1964) described and illustrated R. penarthensis from the Lower Rhaetian of South Wales.

Rhombocythere? sp. Plate 10, figures 10, 11 ; plate 11 , figures 28-31 Discussion.- A fragment of a left valve with the dorsal and end margins missing, and a poorly preserved steinkern of a right valve on matrix resemble Rhombocythere . Features in common with the genus are as follows: Straightbacked in lateral outline; carinate anterior and ventral margins (the posterior and dorsal margins are not preserved), anterior margin wider than posterior in lateral outline, in dorsal outline wider towards anterior; and puncta similar to R. penarthensis Anderson, 1964 (Anderson, 1964, pl. 10, figs. 18, 19; Bate, 1978, pl. 1, fig. 10) preserved near the

C12 Shorter Contributions to Paleontology and Stratigraphy

posterior margin (pl. 11, fig. 30). Because the dorsal and end margins are missing and the adductor muscleattachment scar is not preserved on the fragment, the internal morphology diagnostic of Rhombocythere is unknown for the specimens on hand.
The fragment of a left valve illustrated on plate 10, figure 11, was tilted in the SEM (to look for a possible adductor muscle-attachment scar) so that the dorsal edge was below the plane of the micrograph. The tilting resulted in the distortion of the ventral groove for reception of the smaller valve. Examination with reflected light at X160 shows the proximal boundary of the groove is at the edge of the valve surface as shown by arrows. I cannot interpret the thin ridge that is terminated by minute toothlets inside the groove. Anderson (1964, pl. 10, figs. 21-23) showed that the left valve overlaps the right along the free margins, and Will (1969, p. 69, text figs. 25, 26) illustrated widely spaced radial pore canals along the ventral margin of Notocythere (= Rhombocythere ). The thin ridge inside the groove along the ventral margin shown on figure 11 may represent infilling of the vestibule. The minute toothlets on either side of the ridge could possibly represent bases of radial pore canals; however, the entire structure may be an artifact resulting from fossilization.
The specimens on hand differ from all the known species in Rhombocythere in having a shallow kidney-shaped trough on the central part of the lateral surface; a shallow indentation from above into the dorsal boundary of the trough (pl. 10, fig. I0; pl. 11 , figs. 29, 30); and widest in front of midlength in dorsal outline.

Superfamily HEALDIACEA Harlton, 1933 Sohn (1965) discussed this superfamily. The aggregate adductor muscle-attachment scar also is present in nonmarine podocopids of Mississippian age (Sohn, 1985). This similarity indicates homeomorphy rather than phylogeny in the evolution of the so-called healdiid adductor muscle scar.

the stratigraphic range of Healdia to be Devonian to Permian, but Coryell (1963, p. 929) listed three Lower Jurassic species of Healdia. Sohn (1968, p. 52) recorded two taxa in the Triassic: Healdia bella Gerke, 1937, from the Lower Triassic of Siberia, as a nomen nudum, and Ostracode C Kristan-Tollmann, 1964, as Healdia? sp. However, Kristan-Tollmann (1971a, p.51) described the new genus Torohealdia and designated Ostracode C as the type species, T. amphicrassa n. gen. n. sp., from the NorianRhaetian of the Alpine Triassic.
The following species from the Triassic have been described in or referred to Healdia :
Will (1969, p. 52) described from the Rhaetian of north-
western Germany Healdia? tenuivirgata = Ogmoconcha
martini (Anderson, 1964) fide Bate, 1978, p. 82. Gramm (I969a) illustrated the adductor muscle scars in open nomenclature of Healdia sp. 1, H.? sp. 2, andH. sp. 3, and the carapaces of H. sp. I and H.? sp. 2 from the Upper Anisian of the Primor'ye Region, U.S.S.R. The next year, Gramm (1970) described the specimens and erected Healdia unitumulata and also H. zharnikovae to which he referred H. sp. 1 Gramm, 1969, and H. spp. 3 to 8 Gramm, 1969a. Kozur (1970a, p. 21-23) described from the Upper Anisian of Hungary Healdia (Healdia) anisica, H. (H.) felsooerensis, and H. (Hungarella) reniformis (Mehes, 1911) and stated that the three species have a nondenticulated hinge. Bolz (197lb, p. 742, 744, pls. 3, 4) illustrated Healdia spp. A to G from the Alpine Norian-Rhaetian. Kozur (1972a, table 1) listed from the Rhaetian of Germany Healdia (Hungarella) aspinata Drexler, 1958, originally described from the Lower Jurassic, H. (Hungarella) caudata Anderson, 1964, H. (Hungarella) martini Anderson, 1964, and H. (Hungarella) owthropensis Anderson, 1964. Urlichs 1972 (1973 fide Kristan-Tollmann and Hamedani, 1973, p. 210), p. 688, identified Healdia martini (Anderson, 1964) from the German Upper Norian-Rhaetian. Urlichs' illustrated specimens, however, do not have a posterolateral hump on the left valve; consequently, they are not conspecific with Anderson's species. Gheorgian (1976, p. 37) identified and illustrated Healdia (Healdia) felsooerensis Kozur, 1970, from the Ladinian of Rumania. The presence of two spines on each valve of the Rumanian specimen excludes that species from Healdia (H. ) felsooerensis. Hou and Gou, 1977 (Ye and others, 1977, p. 301), described and illustrated Healdia jingguensis from the Carnian of Yunnan, P.R.C.
Because Gramm (1969a, p. 457, figs. 1, 2; 1970, p. 45, figs. 1, 2) illustrated the adductor muscle-attachment scars of Healdia zharnikovae with a few scars, similar to those illustrated herein, I am referring the specimens from Alaska to "Healdia." The Triassic species lack the dorsoposterior flattening originally described in Healdia. The discovery of

These specimens are not formally named because only one carapace with part of the right valve and the posterior dorsal portion of the left valve retained is available; the others are steinkerns. Plate 1, figures 1-4, are of a steinkern with the same lateral outline as the other illustrated specimens. Although the posterior lateral ridge is not preserved, this specimen is included because the denticulate hinge is partly preserved on the posterior and dorsal views (pl. 1, figs. 1, 3). Plate 1, figures 5-9, are of a smaller steinkern that has a well preserved adductor muscle scar as well as dorsal attachment muscle scars (pl. 1, figs. 6-8) and a faint indication of a denticulate hinge (pl. 1, fig. 5).
Plate 1, figures 10-14, are of the largest available steinkerns that show straight posterior lateral ridges instead of curved ridges as on the illustrated specimens that follow. Plate 1, figure 13, has a poorly preserved adductor muscleattachment scar that is similar in number of individual spots (stigmata) to that illustrated on figures 7, 8, and 18. These scars resemble the pattern illustrated by Gramm (1969a, p. 457, fig. 1.1-1.5) for Healdia sp. 1 (=H. zharnikovae Gramm, 1970) from the upper Anisian, and the posterior ridge on H. sp. 3 Gramm [1969a, figs. 4g, d (4d, e in English translation)] resembles the specimen illustrated herein as figures 12 and 13.
Prof. M. N. Gramm kindly examined the illustrations and a preliminary version of this discussion. He stated (written commun., July 12, 1984) that the adductor muscleattachment scar pattern on the specimens from Alaska are close to those he had illustrated on specimens from the Primor'ye Region. He added that he had seen denticulation along the hinge of the right valve of Healdia sp. 3 (Gramm, 1970, pl. 7, fig. 2). Plate 1, figures 15-21 , show the adductor muscle-attachment scar pattern and denticulate hinge, but, because the posterior lateral ridges are curved on this specimen and appear to be straight on the steinkern illustrated on plate 1, figures 12 and 13, this specimen probably represents a different species. The specimens are illustrated herein as "Healdia" sp. 1, sp. 2, and sp. 3.
Geologic range.-Devonian-Triassic, ?Lower Jurassic. Geographic distribution.- Cosmopolitan.
"Healdia" sp. 1 Plate 1, figures 1-9 Discussion.- Two steinkerns and one measured specimen (USNM 389808) on which the right valve is missing and the anterior part of the left valve is missing are illustrated herein. The cast of the right valve on this specimen has a well-preserved adductor muscle-attachment scar that is similar to those illustrated herein (pl. 1, figs. 7, 8, 10), and the posterior of the left valve does not have a posterolateral ridge nor is one preserved on the cast of the right valve.

"Healdia" sp. 2 Plate 1, figures 10-14 Discussion.-One steinkern with straight posterolateral ridges that differ from the curved ridges of "Healdia" sp. 3 is illustrated. The adductor muscle-attachment scar is poorly preserved (fig. 13) but is within the limits of those illustrated herein for "Healdia". Measurements (in mm).-USNM 389805, greatest length 0.60, greatest height 0.40.

"Healdia" sp. 3 Plate 1, figures 15-21 Discussion.- In addition to the illustrated specimen, a steinkern (USNM 389807) from the Ladinian has an adductor muscle scar with four rows of stigmata arranged in a more circular outline than those illustrated. In addition, two specimens from the Carnian (USGS colin. 33143), one of which is a carapace and the other the posterior half of a carapace (USNM 389809), have curved posterolateral ridges. These specimens are probably conspecific with the one illustrated herein. Measurements (in mm).-Unfigured specimen, USNM 389807, greatest length 0.42, greatest height, 0.28; USNM 809806, greatest length 0.53, greatest height 0.35; two unfigured specimens, USNM 389809, broken carapace greatest length 0. 35, greatest height 0. 31, carapace, greatest length 0.50, greatest height 0.32. Geologic range.-Ladinian, limestone and dolomite member, from 35. 1 to 36.6 m (115-120 ft) above the base of the Shublik Formation, and Carnian, Limestone Member, from 97.5 to 99.1 m (320-325 ft) above the base of the Shublik Formation.
Genus PSEUDOBYTHOCYPRIS Shaver, 1958 Type species.-Bythocypris pediformis Knight, 1928 Discussion.-Sohn (1983, p. 27) discussed this genus and recorded the geologic range of Pseudobythocypris to be Mississippian through Permian, but, based on this possible Triassic occurrence, the range is here questionably extended into the Upper Triassic (Carnian).
Psuedobythocypris? sp. Plate 2, figures 14-17 Discussion.- The unique specimen is a thin-shelled, smooth carapace with a gently curved dorsal margin, a rounded anterior margin, and a truncated posterior margin.

C14 Shorter Contributions to Paleontology and Stratigraphy

The dorsal outline is elliptical, with gently curved sides and relatively blunt, equal ends. The greatest width is in front of the midlength. The carapace resembles the Pennsylvanian Bythocypris pediformis Knight, 1928, the type-species of Pseudobythocypris. Bolz (1971a, p. 235, pl. 8, figs. 120121) illustrated from the Norian-Rhaetian, Norten Alps, the right views of one instar and one adult of Bythocypris sp. B that differ from the specimen on hand in being slightly higher and larger (length 0. 80-0.91 mm, height 0.41-0. 50 mm, and width 0.38-0.43 mm). Bate (1978, p. 180, pl. 1, fig. 4) illustrated the left view of a carapace of Lower Anisian age as Bythocypris sp. B Bolz, 1971. The specimen from Britian has the right valve larger than the left instead of the reverse as in both Bythocypris and Pseudobythocypris and should not be considered congeneric with the specimens discussed above. Because the adductor muscle-attachment scar of the carapace from Alaska is unknown, it is only tentatively referred to the Paleozoic genus.

Type species.-0. contractu/a Triebel, 1941, p. 377, pl. 14, figs. 156-160. Liassic, borehole, Germany. Diagnosis (from Anderson, 1964, p. 146).-"A smooth genus in the Healdiidae with strong overlap of the left valve over right on all margins. Hinge margin of right valve with minute vettically oriented teeth which articulate with serial sockets in left valve. Adductor muscle-attachment scar aggregate." Description.- According to Triebel (1941, p. 378), Ogmoconcha is small to medium sized, with thick, smooth shells. The carapace is elliptical to egg-shaped in lateral, dorsal, and end views. The left valve has a marginal groove for the reception of the right valve. Abundant minute, normal pore canals are simple; marginal pore canals are barely discernable, and a definite zone of concrescence (Verschmeltzungszone) is not discernible. Discussion.-As indicated in the discussion of the Hungarella-Ogmoconcha problem, most of the Triassic species have been recorded as Hungarella Mehes, 1911. Lord (1972, p. 323) listed the Triassic species under Hungarella and the Liassic species under Ogmoconcha.

Because several Triassic ostracodes in Alaska have an aggregate adductor muscle-attachment scar and some of these have denticulate hinges, the genus Ogmoconcha is confirmed in the Triassic. Many, but not all, of the Triassic species referred to Hungarella Mehes, 1911, that have a denticulate hinge probably belong in Ogmoconcha.

Middle And Upper Triassic Marine Ostracoda, Northeastern Alaska C15

holotype equals 0. 720. Specimens from Alaska range in length from 0.41 to 0.61 mm and in height from 0.29 to 0.43 mm, and their h/1 ranges from 0. 700 to 0.800. In addition to size and h/1 index, these specimens have in common with 0. owthropensis a relatively straight ventral contact, a relatively blunt posterior outline in dorsal view with evenly curved sides that taper more towards the anterior than towards the posterior, and a similar outline in end view~ The hinge of a paratype of 0. owthropensis is denticulated and tripartite with a narrow central portion and wider end portions (Anderson, 1964, pl. 14, fig. 101; Bate, 1978, pl. 1, fig. 15). The specimens in Alaska have poorly preserved denticulate hingements. The posterior two-thirds of the right valve of the carapace illustrated on plate 5, figures 11-16, is missing, thus exposing denticulations only along the center of the hinge, and the left valve illustrated on plate 9, figures 9-12, has a denticulated hinge that may not be tripartite. Twelve specimens from Ladinian to Norian collections in Alaska are illustrated to show that they can vary. Better preserved material may disclose that more than one species may be represented.

Type level.- Norian, clay shale member of Shublik Formation.
Diagnosis.-A species of Ogmoconcha with a height to length index of more than 0. 700 and with an acute posterior outline in dorsal view.
Description.- The carapace is smooth, without any spines or pleats. In lateral outline, the dorsal margin is convex with the greatest height behind midlength, the ventral margin is straight, and the anterior margin is narrower than the posterior margin. The dorsal margin is elliptical, with the greatest width behind midlength, and the anterior end is slightly more acute than the posterior end. The hingement is denticulate.

Discussion.- Specimens with the height to length index of more than 0. 700 differ from the specimens illustrated herein as 0. sp. aff. 0. owthropensis (Anderson, 1964) in that they have a more acute posterior in dorsal outline. These specimens are not considered to be sexual dimorphs of the above taxon because they range in length from 0.40 to 0.55 mm, thus representing two or more growth stages younger than 0. sp. aff. 0. owthropensis of which the largest specimen is 0.61 mm in length. The hingement of a juvenile is denticulate (pl. 5, figs. 25, 28), but the adductor muscle scar of the new species is unknown. The holotype (pl. 9, figs. 24, 25) lacks part of the posterior of the right valve, but the outline of the posterior end of the left valve in dorsal view is definitely acute.
Geologic range.-Norian, clay shale member, from 112.8 to 143.3 m (370-470 ft) above the base of the Shublik Formation.

Paratype.- USNM 389856. Type level.-Ladinian. USGS colln. 33112. Diagnosis.-Ogmoconcha with a posteroventral spine on the smaller right valve. Description.- The carapace is small, less than 0.5 mm in greatest length, the valves are subovate, the ends are rounded, the dorsoanterior margin is more gently rounded than the dorsoposterior margin, and the overlap is even around all the margins. A stout spine, of which only the base is preserved on the specimens recovered, is located about equidistant from the ventral and posterior margins on the right valve. The greatest length is approximately at midheight, the greatest height is slightly behind midlength. The dorsal outline is subelliptical, the anterior end is narrower than the posterior end, and the greatest width is behind midlength. Measurements (in mm).-USNM 389855, greatest length 0.42, greatest height 0.30, h/1 0. 714; USNM 389856, greatest length 0.43, greatest height 0.29, h/1 0.674. Discussion.-Healdia (Hungarella) reniformis (Mehes, 1911) of Kozur, 1970, as illustrated by Kozur (1970b, p. 22, pl. 4, figs. 15-17) from the Anisian and Ladinian near Felsoc)rs, Bakony, Hungary, also has a ventroposterior spine on the right valve. The specimens from Alaska differ from Hungarian specimens not only in a more elongate lateral outline and in lacking a ridge below the posterior half of the dorsal margin of the right valve (pl. 10, figs. 12, 13) but also in the fact that the hingement of the Hungarian specimens is smooth ("Schlosselemente glatt"), whereas the specimens from Alaska have a denticulated hinge as shown herein (pl. 5, figs. 1, 2). The largest specimen from Felsoors recorded by Kozur (1970b) is 0.520 mm long. Mehes (1911, p. 22), however, recorded the length of his Bairdia(?) problematica var. reniformis as 0. 71 mm. Specimens as long as 0. 70 mm with a ventroposterior spine on the right valve and a denticulate hinge are present in the Lower Carnian marl from Csopak, Nesztery Valley, Hungary (Sohn, 1984b, figs. 11E-G; herein pl. 10, figs. 12-14). In addition, specimens in the same collection without a posteroventral spine on the right valve that have denticulate hinges (pl. 11 , figs. 13-16, 20-24) are present in the Hungarian Triassic. Unfortunately, I have not been able to determine the adductor muscle scar in my specimens from Hungary, even after converting some specimens to fluorite. Geologic range.-Ladinian, limestone and dolomite member, from 38.1 to 39.6 m (125-130 ft) above the base of the Shublik Formation.

Description.-The holotype, a carapace with a fragment of the shell missing on the posterior of the left valve, has a relatively thick shell as shown on plate 8, figures 12 and 14. The dorsal margin of the larger valve does not overreach and overlap the smaller valve as much as the ventral margin does (pl. 8, figs. 1, 12). The greatest convexity of the anterior margin of the left valve is lower in relation to the height than that of the posterior margin (pl. 8, figs. 14, 18; pl. 9, fig. 2; pl. 10, figs. 3, 5). The denticulate hinge ofthe right valve is not as distinctly tripartite (pl. 5, figs. 20-22) as it is in 0. owthropensis (Anderson, 1964) (Anderson, 1964, pl. 14, fig. 101; Bate, 1978, pl. 1, fig. 15), as well as in the Hungarian 0. sp. illustrated herein (pl. 10, figs. 12, 13). Although the adductor muscle scar is poorly preserved (pl. 8, figs. 18, 19; pl. 10, fig. 5), the aggregate outline is typical of Ogmoconcha.

Discussion.-The carapace from the Austrian Alps that was illustrated by Urlichs (1972, pl. 4, fig. 6) resembles a paratype illustrated herein (pl. 8, figs. 15-19) in lateral outline and in apparent surface punctation. I attribute the relatively thin shell of the illustrated specimen to corrosion which removed part of the outside of the shell. Urlichs' specimen also represents a corroded carapace as indicated by the missing shell material along the dorsoanterior margin. The puncta that are present on the anterior half on my specimen and that are barely visible on the posterior half of Urlichs' illustration are interpreted to be cross sections of normal pores.
Geologic range .-Anisian?, Ladinian through Norian, from 25.9 to 145.4 m (85-477 ft) above the base of the Shublik Formation. The Anisian age is questioned because USGS colln. 33106, from which a carapace (USNM 389916) was recovered, is located below the Ladinian as determined by megafossils.

Other level.-The same member as above, from 121.9 to 123.4 m (400-405 ft) above the base of the Shublik Formation. USGS colin. 33154. Diagnosis .-Differs from all other species of Ogmoconcha in subtriangular lateral outline, the anterior margin being much higher than the posterior margin. Description.-The carapaces are small, less than 0.5 mm in greatest length. The hingeline is almost straight; it extends forward from the posterior margin to about two-thirds of the greatest length of the valves. The anterior margin is broadly rounded and is about twice the height of the posterior margin, and its greatest convexity is located below the hingeline at or lower than the junction of the posterior margin with the ventral margin. The ventral margin curves steeply backward and upward to meet the posterior margin. The left valve overlaps the right along the free margins and overreaches slightly along the hinge margin. The paratype (pl. 10, figs. 23-26) lacks a small part of the right valve at the dorsoposterior, where the denticulated hinge is exposed (pl. 10, figs. 23, 26). Measurements (in mm).-USNM 389882, greatest length 0.23, greatest height 0.17, h/1 0. 739; USNM 389889, greatest length 0.43, greatest height 0.30, h/1 0.750; USNM 389905, greatest length 0.45, greatest height 0.35, h/1 0. 778.

Discussion .-Although only two carapaces and one steinkem of this species have been recovered, they differ in lateral outline from the described species in Ogmoconcha, thus warranting their description as a new species. Both carapaces have what appears to be a minute ventroposterior spine on the right valve (pl. 10, figs. 24, 28, 29). Because both carapaces are covered with adhering grains of an undetermined mineral, I did not use the presence of the spinelet(?) as an additional specific character. A minute steinkem (pl. 9, figs. 5-8) is referred to this species because of its lateral outline. Although the adductor muscle scar of specimens is unknown, this species is referred to Ogmoconcha because of the external morphology.
The Lower Pliensbachian (Jurassic) 0. eocontractula Park, 1984, from Europe, has a triangular lateral outline, but that species (0.87-0.91 mm long) is much larger than 0. marquardti , its ventral margin is not as truncated towards the posterior, and both valves have spinelets along the anterior margin-features that differentiate the two species. Cytherella inaequata Donze, 1966, as illustrated by Blaszyk and Gazdzicki (1982, p. 133, pl. 46, fig. 2) from the Hettangian (Late Jurassic) of Poland, differs from Donze's (1966) species in having a triangular lateral outline similar to the new species. This unnamed species is larger than 0.
marquardti (L = 0. 76 mm), and it has an obtuse posterior in
dorsal outline. Geologic range .-Norian, clay shale member, from
119.3 to 129.5 m (365-425 ft) above the base ofthe Shublik Formation.
Ogmoconcha sp. Plate 10, figures 12-14 Ogmoconcha n. sp. Sohn, 1984b, p. 21, fig. llE-G, Carnian, Hungary. Discussion .-See discussion under 0. unicerata n. sp. Kozur's species, however, does not have a denticulated hinge and does not belong to Ogmoconcha . The Hungarian species is not formally named and described because study of Hungarian material is beyond the scope of this paper. The Upper Triassic (Carnian) taxon illustrated herein has a tripartite denticulate hinge, suggesting that 0. unicerata from Alaska is not related on the generic level with the Anisian and Ladinian specimens illustrated by Kozur (1970a, p. 22, pl. 4, figs. 15-17) as 0 gmoconcha reniformis (Mehes, 1911).

?Ogmoconcha sp. Sohn, 1968, p. 29, pl. 3, figs. 1-3, 8. Ladinian, Italy. Discussion .-Because only one left valve on matrix from
the Ladinian part of the Shublik Formation (63.6-65.2 m
above the base) is available, the species is not named. The specimen is probably a left valve because of the well developed dorsal pleat and narrower ventral pleat or rim. This specimen differs from the left valves illustrated by Urlichs (1971 , pl. 1, figs. 3, 5, text fig. 4) in lateral outline and size of dorsal pleat. Because the interior of the valve is obscured by rock, neither the hingement nor the adductor muscle scar can be determined; it is only questionably referred to Ogmoconcha. To orient the specimen for measurement, an attempt to smooth the rock below the valve resulted in breaking the anteroventral part of the shell. Approximate measurements are 0.8 mm long and 0.6 mm high.
Because Reuss (1868, p. 108) did not illustrate Cytherella limbata, that species was listed as "Gen. and sp. indet." (Sohn, 1968, p. 45), and the illustrated specimens were identified as Ogmoconcha sp. (Sohn, 1968, pl. 3, figs. 1-3, 8). Unfortunately, the valve illustrated on fig. 8 is lost; consequently, only the three remaining carapaces illustrated above could be measured to compare them with Urlichs' measurements of an ontogenetic series.
Urlichs (1971, p. 708) stated that his collections were from Reuss' type locality, and he identified and illustrated the species based on the original description. He described the right valve as having a small ventroposterior spine (1971 , pl. 1, figs. 7, 8, 11) and a narrow frill along the anterior margin. The anterior marginal frill is not discernible on the thn~e carapaces from Italy in the National Museum. The illustrated carapace (Sohn, 1968, pl. 3, fig. 2) has a minute posteroventral spine not seen on the published magnification of X30, but the other two carapaces do not have that spine preserved.
Only the specimens discussed above have pleats on the left valve; all the other species in Ogmoconcha have smooth left valves. Figure 7 was included on the plate that illustrates specimens of the Ussuricavininae Gramm, 1969, to suggest that these Ogmoconcha specimens are possible relatives of the Ussuricavininae, a subfamily that is poorly known.

Subfamily USSURICAVININAE Gramm, 1969 Discussion .-Gramm (1969b, p. 55) described this subfamily for the Triassic marine genera Ussuricavina Gramm, 1969, Orlovicavina Gramm, 1969, and Cavussurella Gramm, 1969. The following year, Gramm (1970, p. 100) established the subfamily Recytellinae in the family Cytherellidae Sars, 1866, for the Middle Triassic genera Recytella Gramm, 1970, and Recytelloidea Gramm, 1970. Kozur (1972b, p. 18) considered Cavussurella Gramm, 1969, and Recytella Gramm, 1970, to be synonyms of Reubenella Sohn, 1968; Orlovicavina Gramm, 1969, to be a synonym of Issacharella Sohn, 1968; and Recytelloidea Gramm, 1970 to be a synonym of Leviella Sohn, 1968-all in the family Cytherellidae Sars, 1866. Sohn (1968, p. 21) questionably referred Leviella to the Cytherellidae Sars, 1866, because the adductor muscle-attachment scar pattern of this genus was not known. Kristan-Tollmann (1973, p. 360, 363, 370) illustrated aggregate adductor muscleattachment scars of several species of Triassic (Carnian) Levie/la similar to those in the Cavellinacea as defined in Moore (1961, p. Q368) but not to those in the Cytherellacea as defined in Moore (1961, p. Q382). The subfamily Recytellinae Gramm, 1970, was defined as having an external depression on the ventral portion of the brood pouch on each female valve (Gramm, 1970, p. 100), a feature absent in the Ussuricavininae. Cavussurella and Recytella are considered in this study to be valid genera. Geologic range .-Middle and Upper Triassic.

Discussion.-The holotype of C. kramtchanini Gramm (1969b, pl. 5, fig. 14) is a possible juvenile right valve 0. 775 mm long and 0.520 mm high. A paratype, the carapace of a male (Gramm, 1969b, pl. 5, figs. 15a-d), 0.925 mm long, 0.575 mm high, and 0.350 mm wide was illustrated in right, left, dorsal, and ventral views. Both speci- · mens have a weak subcentral pit and a marginal rim that is

Type /eve/.-Ladinian, limestone and dolomite member, from 48.8 to 50.3 m (160-165 ft) above the base of the Shublik Formation. Diagnosis .-Differs from Cavussurella kramtchanini Gramm, 1969b, in that the posterior margin is more broadly rounded, dimorphic in width of posterior. Description. -Although the specimens are poorly preserved, the following composite conception of the new species can be constructed. The valves are relatively thick (pl. 3, figs. 13, 14, 15-17, 18, 19; pl. 4, figs. 14, 18), subovate, almost elliptical. The dorsal and ventral margins are gently convex and are of approximately the same curvature and height. The right valve overlaps the left slightly along the ventral margin (pl. 3, figs. 16, 17; pl. 4, figs. 3, 12-14) and overreaches along the dorsal margin (pl. 4, figs. 5, 10); it is more convex along the dorsum than the smaller left valve (pl. 4, fig. 2). The right valve has a thicker marginal rim than the left valve (pl. 4, figs. 1, 3, 10-15), and the rim is more pronounced along the dorsum than along the ventral margin and is subdued along the end margins (pl. 3, figs. 14, 15; pl. 4, figs. 3, 4, 10, 14). The species is dimorphic in dorsal outline; the heteromorphs (females) are widest near the posterior (pl. 4, fig. 12), and the tecnomorphs (males and juveniles) are widest behind midlength (pl. 3, figs. 15, 18; pl. 4, figs. 1, 3, 9). One juvenile (pl. 4, figs. 1-5) has a punctate surface, and it is assumed that the smooth specimens were also punctate. The adductor muscle scar is not preserved, except possibly on the steinkem of the left valve (pl. 3, fig. 20) where it is too

poorly preserved to determine the individual rows of spots. Fragments and steinkems from the same collection as the paratypes (USGS colln. 33132) are tentatively referred to this species (USNM 390039). Because the genus is based primarily on the adductor muscle scar of the type species, the illustrations and a preliminary draft of the description of this species were sent to Prof. M. N. Gramm who very kindly compared the illustrations with the holotype and paratypes of C. kramtchanini. He stated (written commun., July 12, 1984) that, in his opinion, the forms are congeneric.

Cavussurella? spp. Plate 10, figure 9; plate 11, figures 25-27 Discussion .-Fragments and steinkems of specimens that cannot be assigned with certainty to Cavussurella grammi are provisionally assigned to the genus. A fragment of a left valve (pl. 10, fig. 9; pl. 11, figs. 25, 26) and a steinkem of a left valve (pl. 11, fig. 27) are illustrated. The fragment (pl. 10, fig. 9; pl. 11, figs. 25, 26), illustrated as Cavussurella sp. 1, has a relatively thick shell similar to C. grammi shown on plate 3, figures 13-21, and plate 4, figures 10-21, and has a pleat below the dorsal margin similar to those on plate 3, figure 10, and plate 4, figure 11. The hinge consists of a groove (pl. 10, fig. 9; pl. 11, fig. 26) hitherto not known in Cavussurella because neither Gramm (1969b) nor I have been able to observe the hingement on specimens of this genus. The groove along the venter for the reception of the smaller valve resembles the groove exposed on broken carapaces of C. grammi (pl. 3, figs. 16, 17; pl. 4, figs. 14, 15, 18). Neither ofthe two spots seen on plate 11, figure 26, represents the adductor muscle scar when examined in the SEM at X500. The steinkem of a left valve, illustrated herein as Cavussurella? sp. 2 (pl. 11, fig. 27), differs in lateral outline from

Genus RECYTELLA Gramm, 1970 Type species .-R. amnekhoroshevi Gramm, 1970, p. 101. text fig. 1, pl. 4, figs. 1-9. Ladinian (AGI translation, p. 86), Primor'ye Territory, U.S.S.R. Diagnosis .-"Cytherellid Recytellinae of average size. Inequivalvular. The adductor scar is of complex structure consisting of a double-row group and is in the stage of reduction of the supernumerary maculae." Discussion .-As stated in the discussion ofthe subfamily Ussuricavininae, Kozur (1972b) considered Cavussurella and Recytella to be junior synonyms of Reubenella. He stated (1972b, p. 19) that Ussuricavina Gramm, 1969b, and the Ussuricavininae belong in the Cavellinidae and that the Recytellinae, including Reubenella, belong to the Cytherellidae. The females (heteromorphs) of Reubenella have a ventroposterior lobe on the outside of the valves (Sohn, 1968, pl. 1, figs. 40, 43-45) that are represented on the inside by distinct cavities (Sohn, 1968, pl. 4, fig. 12). These cavities are lobes on steinkerns as illustrated herein (pl. 2, figs. 1-13) and by Gramm (1969b, pl. 4, figs. 1a, b, 4a). The adductor muscle-attachment scar of Recytella Gramm, 1970, consists of four rows of scars (Gramm, 1970, text fig. 1, pl. 4, figs. 4-9), including the supplementary maculae. The adductor muscle scar of Reubenella Sohn, 1968, consists of more than four rows (Sohn, 1968, pl. 4, fig. 12). The adductor muscle scars illustrated herein (pl. 2, figs. 2, 3, 5) are similar in pattern to the adductor muscleattachment scar illustrated by Gramm for Recytella and document the presence of Recytella in Alaska. Because of very poor preservation and inadequate material, the specimens from Alaska are placed in open nomenclature. Geologic range.- Middle Triassic (Anisian-Ladinian). Geographic distribution. -Primor'ye Territory, U.S.S.R., and northeastern Alaska.
Recytella sp. 1 Plate 2, figures 1-9 Discussion.-The adductor muscle scar illustrated on plate 2, figure 5, and the posterolateral bulge shown on figures 2, 4, 6, 8, 9 identify the two steinkerns as belonging in Recytella .

Measurements (in mm).-USNM 389810, greatest length 0. 72 + , greatest height 0.41 +; USNM 389811, greatest length 0. 7+, greatest height 0.4+.
Geologic range .-Ladinian, limestone and dolomite member, from 56.4 to 67.1 m (185-220 ft) above the base of the Shublik Formation.
Recytella sp. 2 Plate 2, figures 10-13 Discussion.-The illustrated specimen appears to have shell material retained on the right valve. The fact that this apparent shell material extends on the left over the area of the impression of the ventral contact on the steinkern (figs. 10, 11, 13) suggests that this is neither original nor replaced shell material. A steinkern of a left valve and the inside of a damaged left valve in USGS colln. 33132 (USNM 390010) probably belong to this taxon. Measurements in (mm).-USNM 389812, greatest
