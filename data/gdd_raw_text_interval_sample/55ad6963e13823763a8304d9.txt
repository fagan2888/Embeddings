STUDIES RELATED TO CUSMAP
This report supplements results of a geochemical survey of the Delta 1° x 2° quadrangle, Utah. Geochemical samples from within and close to the Delta quadrangle were collected as one of several multidisciplinary studies associated with the Conterminous United States Mineral Assessment Program (CUSMAP).
INTRODUCTION
Beginning in 1986 and continuing through 1989, the U.S. Geological Survey conducted a geochemical survey of the Delta 1° x 2° quadrangle and nearby areas, Utah and Nevada. The geology of the quadrangle and surrounding areas has been succinctly described by Hintze (1988). Rocks range in age from Late Precambrian to Recent and were subjected to compressive stresses during the late Mesozoic and extensional stresses during the late Cretaceous.
METHODS OF STUDY
These data represent geochemical abundances for rock samples collected from a number of mines and prospect areas in the study area. Analyses of altered or mineralized rocks may provide useful geochemical information about the major- and trace-element assemblages associated with a mineralizing system.
Sample Collection
Rock samples were collected from outcrops or mine dumps in the vicinity of the sample location maps provided for the entire set of rock samples collected in the Delta 1° x 2° quadrangle (fig. 1), except those collected in the Dugway mining district, (Zimbelman and others, 1991). These samples generally represent a variety of alteration or mineralization types in any given district or prospect area, including skarn, vein, replacement, source rock, and host rock types.
Sample Analysis
The samples were analyzed for five elements, Pt, Pd, Rh, Ir, and Ru using a fire assay method that employees nickel sulfide collection, followed by Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry (Meier and others, 1991). The limits of detection are 0.5 parts-per-billion (ppb) or less for Pt, Rh, Ir, and Ru, and Pd in a 10 gram sample. Precision is better than 5% relative standard deviation for replicate analysis of homogeneous materials.

DESCRIPTION OF DATA TABLE
Table 1 lists the results of analyses for rocks samples. In addition to the platinum-group elements presented here, gold analyses are also presented for comparative purposes. These gold analyses have been previously reported (Zimbelman and others, 1991) and were obtained by an atomic absorption spectroscopy method described by Thompson and others (1968).
SAMPLE DESCRIPTIONS
Appendix 1 provides a brief sample description, consisting of information gathered during field examinations. Zimbelman and others (1991) provide detailed sample location maps for the samples.
