METAMORPHIC ROCKS OF THE QUADRILATERO FERRIFERO, MINAS GERAIS, BRAZIL

By NORMAN HERZ

ABSTRACT
The metasedimentary rocks in the Qnadrilatero Ferrifero have been divided into the lower Precambrian (pre-2,700 m.y.) Rio das Velhas Series and the middle Precambrian Minas (pre1,350 m.y.) and Itacolomi Series (pre-1,000, perhaps pre-1,350 m.y.). Five thermal events occurred, four of which may have been accompanied by granitic intrusion or formation. All regional metamorphisms were, in general, Barrovian-type lowgrade greenschist facies, either chlorite or biotite isograd except near granitic intrusions where alinandine-aniphibolite facies conditions obtained and the staurolite isograd was developed. The last thermal event, 500 m.y. was accompanied by pegmatite formation and probable retrograde nietamorphism of many of the earlier formed higher grade minerals. In a general way, the metamorphic grade increases to the south and east. Metamorphic aureoles developed around the Bagao Complex and the granite north of the Serra do Curral, where the metamorphic grade falls from staurolite isograde adjacent to the granite to the regional chlorite isograde away from it.
In the chlorite zone, the most widespread assemblages developed in pelitic rocks include: chlorite-sericite (inuscovite)quartz, which is by far the most common, and chlorite-sericite (muscovite)-quartz-cliloritoid, with or without kyanite. Locally abundant are varieties rich in fuchsite, graphite, carbonate, iron oxides, or tourmaline. Because of the extremely high alumina (average 20.1 percent) and potash (average 4.5 percent) content compared to the low lime (0.15 percent and soda (0.35 percent) content, albite and epidote are not as common here as in low-grade rocks elsewhere. They occur with the chlorite-sericite-quartz assemblage.
With increasing nietamorphism, biotite apparently replaces chlorite and sericite. Chlorite changes from an Fe- to Mg-Alrich variety as metamorphic grade increases, but the compositions of associated biotite also appear to change from Fe- to Mg-rich. Grain size becomes coarser in the biotite zone. Both albite and epidote, as well as spessartite, are found locally. In the upper part of the biotite zone, oligoclase and almandine occur.
Staurolite is generally the highest metamorphic zone present in the area, although sillimanite and cordierite are found in the metamorphic aureole south of the Bagao Complex. In this zone, staurolite replaces chloritoid, almandine replaces chlorite and spessartite, and biotite is more abundant, although some

chlorite persists. Kyanite is found in this as in all metamorphic zones; oligoclase and andesine occur in places.
With increasing metamorphic grade, the only significant changes in "pure" itabirite are an increase in size of the quartz and hematite and a change from hematite to specularite. Rare accessory minerals in low-grade itabirite are kaolinite, talc, chlorite, and pyrophyllite; as the grade of nietamorphism increases, tremolite-actiuolite and finally, at the highest grade, cummingtonite-grunerite are found. In dolomitic itabirite, in addition to increase in grain size of magnetite, hematite- specularite, and quartz, with increasing nietamorphism, dolomite disappears, diopside and tremolite-actinolite form in medium-grade rocks, and pyroxene, andradite, and cummingtonite-grunerite form in high-grade rocks.
Carbonate rocks generally do not change their mineralogy with increasing metamorphisni, although they do become coarser grained. Some tremolite and clinozoisite formed near si ear zones; in higher grades cummingtonite also developed.
Quartzo-feldspathic rocks developed suites similar to tl ose in the pelitic rocks, except that plagioclase and microcline are much more abundant.
Amphibolites are found in areas where metamorphism exceeded the greensehist facies. Most of these amphibolites appear to be metamorphosed mafic igneous rocks, although some may be altered "dirty" carbonate rocks. A typical assemblage in these rocks includes hornblende, almandine, andesine, quartz, and some biotite and actinolite.
Major minerals of the Quadrilatero Ferrifero include: Chlorite. One of the most abundant minerals of the region, found in all rocks types and in all metamorphic zones. In changing from lower to higher grade rocks, chlorite appears to lose Fe and become more Mg-Al-rich, as well as coarser grained. It occurs with hematite in higher grade rocks; in rocks containing magnetite, biotite of a composition related to chlo^ite also appears. Chromian chlorite is associated with gold rtineralization. White mica. Includes mostly muscovite but also some fuchsite and pyrophyllite. No paragonite was found in any rock. Muscovite is one of the most abundant minerals of the area and is found in every rock type, except iron-formation, and in every metamorphic grade. In higher grade rocks, it is coarser grained; in the lowest grade, it is fine-grained "sericite." Biotite. Found in medium- to high-grade pelitic schists and in other rock types, but rarely found in low-grade pelites and itabirite. High-Mg biotite is found in carbonate-bearing and

THIS INVESTIGATION

This study of metamorphic geology of the entire area would not have been possible without the full cooperation of the Brazilian and American geologists who worked on the Quadrilatero Ferrifero mapping program. They provided preliminary maps and reports to me in advance of publication and made available their rock collections and thin sections. In all, more than 1,500 thin sections prepared for other geologic studies were examined.
Dr. Djalma Guimaraes, Chief of the ServiQO de

The author spent the period from January 1957 to August 1961 in Belo Horizonte. During that time, collections made by geologists then working or who had previously worked in the Quadrilatero were studied together with field notes and maps. Supplementary samples were also collected, but, because of the great area involved, the study would not have been possible without the availability of collections and maps made by others.
Some samples are represented only by thin sections

Spectrochemical determinations by C. V. Dutra at the Institute de Tecnologia Industrial, Belo Horizonte, were quantitative; those by the U.S. Geological Survey in Washington, D.C., semiquantitative. The methods used for quantitative analysis as well as their accuracy and precision are discussed elsewhere (Herz and Dutra, 1960). The semiquantitative analyses are reported either to the nearest number in the series 10, 3, 1, 0.3 or in the series 10, 7, 5, 3, 2, 1.5, and 1. Detection limits for spectrographic analyses are shown in table 1.

Metasedimentary rocks in the Quadrilatero Ferrifero have been divided into three series, f^om oldest to youngest, the Rio das Velhas, the Minas, and the Itacolomi. A fourth group of rocks, possibly older than these three, is found as roof pendants or xenoliths, like those near Engenheiro Corre?\, and cannot be mapped in detail. General description-' of the stratigraphy, as well as of the structure and physiography of the region as a whole, have been written by Dorr (1969).

rocks; oligoclase, microcline, biotite, muscovite, and clinozoisite complete the assemblage. Garnet-quartz amphibolite is associated with these quartzose gneisses.
These oldest metasedimentary rocks are gneisses that were laid down as feldspathic sandstone, arkose, and similar rocks, or they are garnet amphibolite forired from mafic volcanic material, graywacke, and argillaceous dolomite.
The exact relationship of these rocks to the Rio das Velhas Series is not yet known. Tolbert (1962) described a structural and lithologic unconformity within the Nova Lima Group, between rocks of the Morro Velho and the Raposas mines. If this unconformity separates rocks of greatly different ages, then it is

C6 REGIONAL GEOLOGY OF THE QUADRILATERO FERRlFERO, MINAS GERAIS, BRAZIL

possible that the rocks near Engenheiro Correa can be correlated with the lower part of the Nova Lima Group (Dorr, 1969, p. A16).
These rocks are pre-2,700 m.y., because they were already metamorphosed at that time (Herz and others, 1961).
RIO DAS VELHAS SERIES
The Eio das Velhas Series is divided into three groups, from oldest to youngest, Nova Lima, Maquine (Dorr and others, 1957), and Tamandua (Simmons and Maxwell, 1961). All three groups are separated by unconformities.
The Nova Lima Group is by far the most widespread in the area. It is composed largely of phyllite, mica schist, and quartz-mica schist; minor interbedded rocks are metamorphosed iron-formation, graywacke, subgraywacke, quartzite, conglomerate, metavolcanic rocks, graphitic schist and phyllite, quartz-ankerite rocks, and other metasedimentary rocks. The Maquine Group is found principally in a broad anticlinorium from the Nova Lima quadrangle southeast to the Sao Bartolomeu quadrangle and eastward to the Serra do Caraga. It consists of a lower formation, the Palmital, comprised of quartz-sericite schist and interbedded graywacke, sericitic quartzite, and conglomerate, and an upper formation, the Casa Forte, made up largely of quartzite, much conglomerate, and some phyllite and schist. The uppermost group, the Tamandua, which may actually be lower Minas (Dorr, 1969), underlies the Serra do Caraga, Serra das Cambotas, and the Serra do Tamandua. It consists of a lowermost quartzite followed by phyllite and quartzite schist, dolomite itabirite, and phyllitic schist.
Metamorphosed equivalents of the Rio das Velhas Series north of the Bagao Complex and on the west slope of the Serra da Moeda have yielded dates that range from about 2,300 m.y. to 2,800 m.y. (Herz, 1970), so it must be assumed that the Rio das Velhas Series is older than about 2,700 m.y.
MINAS SERIES
The Minas Series overlies the Rio das Velhas and is separated from it by a profound unconformity (Rynearson and others, 1954). It is younger than 2,700 m.y. and probably older than about 1,350 m.y., as it is intruded by the granite of Peti and metasomatized by that of Moeda, which have yielded dates of 1,230 m.y. and 1,320 m.y., respectively (Herz 1970).
The Minas Series underlies a large part of the Quadrilatero Ferrifero and is made up of, from oldest

to youngest, the Caraga Group, the Itabira Group, and the Piracicaba Group (Dorr and others, 1957).
The Caraga Group is divided into two formations, the Moecla (Wallace, 1958) and the Batatal (Maxwell, 1958). Both the upper and lower members of the Moeda Formation are composed predominantly of quartzite and quartzite conglomerate; the intermediate member is a quartz phyllite. The Batatal Formation
is largely fine-grained phyllite, in places arenaceous, and some pyrite. Some chert and lenticular beds of iron-formation are intercalated in the upper part of the formation.
The Itabira Group is divided into two formations, the Cane Itabirite and the Gandarela Formation (Dorr, 1958). The Caue is itabirite, a metamorphosed oxide-facies iron-formation composed of alternating laminae of quartz and hematite. Locally, dolomitic itabirite or dolomite is interbedded and, in places, amphiboles substitute for part of the quartz. Magnetite commonly occurs in the dolomitic itabirite. A few small lenses of quartzite or phyllite are found. The
Gandarela Formation normally consists of dolomite and subordinate dolomitic or siliceous iron-formation and phyllite; in many places, however, phyllite is the dominant rock. In the Dom Bosco, Sao Juliao, and the Catas Altas quadrangles, the Gandarela consists of a greenschist composed largely of chlorite and variable amounts of epidote, quartz, and magnetite.
The Piracicaba Group, overlying the Itabira Group, is divided into five formations. Local erosional unconformities exist between the lower four and the uppermost formation; other unconformities are found below and above the group. The five formations of the Piracicaba Group, from its base, are the Cercadinho
(Pomerene, 1958), the Fecho do Furil (Simmons, 1958), the Tabooes Quartzite (Pomerene, 1958), the Barreiro (Pomerene, 1958), and the ^abara (Gair, 1958b).
The Cercadinho Formation is composed of ferruginous quartzite overlain by phyllite. The ferruginous quartzite is made up of quartz grains and flaky specular hematite; the lowermost bed is locally conglomeratic. The Fecho do Funil Formation is dolomitic
phyllite and argillaceous dolomite, phyllite, and ferreginous quartzite. The Tabooes quartzite is a finegrained translucent quartzite containing irregular brown-stained cavities; in most places it weathers to a friable sand. The Barreiro Formation consists of interbedded phyllite and graphitic phyllite. The Sabara Formation is separated locally from the underlying and overlying formations by erosional unconformities and is a thick series of plrdlites, schists,

graywackes, subgraywackes, and, locally, metamorphosed tuffs, cherts, and thin iron-formation.
ITACOLOMI SERIES
Overlying the Minas Series with angular unconformity is the Itacolomi Series (Barbosa, in Dorr and others, 1959-1961, p. 81-84). It consists largely of quartzite but contains beds of phyllite and metaconglomerate. The quartzites are composed of quartz and muscovite, are generally schistose, and locally grade into mica scists. Hematite varies in amount from traces to quanties sufficient to make the rock a ferruginous quartzite.
No direct evidence bears on the age of the Itacolomi. The maximum angular unconformity between it and the Minas Series is about 15°, which may be the result of epeirogenic upwarp.
' AREAL STRUCTURE AND METAMORPHISM

trace elements in both the older and younger granitic rocks (Herz and Dutra, 1958) and by their close association.
After the 1,350-m.y. orogeny, thermal events took place about 1,000 and 500 m.y. ago. The effects of the two later thermal events are difficult to assess. Minor folding and extensive thrust faults and fracture zones modified the structural pattern that preceded them, and pegmatite formed during the 500 m.y. event. Stress appears to have been directed from the general area of the major Precambrian geosynclinal axis, represented today by the charnockite belt of eastern Minas Gerais and Espirito Santo; the deformation thrust rocks such as the Minas Series over the gneiss domes. This resulted in a westward and northward overturning of folds and the formation of thrust faults. Some of these fault zones may have been later filled by granitic rock around the Serra do Curral and Bagao Complex and diabasic rocks elsewhere, as in the Serra do Caraga.

The dominant structural feature of the Quadrilatero Ferrifero is the synclinal ridges of the Minas Series, the outline of which gives the region its name. Many of these ridges are overturned folds having amplitudes from 1 to more than 50 kilometers. The older preMiiias rocks have been subjected to several deformations and are poorly exposed, so that their detailed structures can only be determined locally in underground mines. The Itacolomi has been folded in the same general structural pattern as the Minas Series.
Five thermal events occurred, four of which may have been accompanied by granitic intrusions (Herz, 1970, table 2). The first datable event, about 2,700 m.y. ago, was a post-Rio das Velhas orogeny. Intrusion is known to have taken place at that date in the presentday area of the Bagao Complex and on the west side of the Serra da Moeda, and well-layered gneiss may have formed throughout the area at that time. An event about 1,930 m.y. ago is known only from Lagoa Santa, about 55 km north of Belo Horizonte and the Moeda Complex, and its effects on the metamorphic rocks is not known.
About 1,350 m.y. ago, after the deposition of the Minas and Itacolomi Series, granitic domes were reactivated and intrusion took place throughout the area. This orogeny masked most of the effects of the earlier one and imposed the present structural trends on the region. Synclines striking north and east formed between large anticlinoria of older metasedimentary rock and gneissic domes. Much of the granite of this orogeny may represent anatectic melts produced from the older rocks, judging by a striking similarity in

NORTHWESTERN PART
The most important structural feature of the northwestern part of the Quadrilatero Ferrifero is an overturned anticline of Minas rocks striking about north 70° E. along the crest of the Serra do Curral. It is the longest linear structure in the Quadrilatero Ferrifero, extending for more than 100 km from the extreme western edge to the Piedade quadrangle.
To the north of the anticline are gneisses which extend the length of the Serra. They are covered to the north by relatively undeformed Precambrian or lower Paleozoic carbonate rocks, pelites, and quartzites. In the contact area of the gneissic and Minas rocks, a possible thrust zone may have been a channelway for younger intrusives.
Toward the west side of the Quadrilatero Ferrifero, the north-striking Serra da Moeda runs into the south side of the Serra do Curral in the Macacos and Ibirite quadrangles. South of the Serra do Curral, and west of the Serra da Moeda, the Bonfim gneissic dome contains a core of gneiss surrounded by younger granitic rocks. Rio das Velhas rocks appear in and around the dome and have about the same low degree of metamorphism as have the Minas rocks, except within a contact aureole in the extreme west where staurolite and garnet have formed in pelitic rocks. Foliation is the dominant planar structure in the older rocks, whereas bedding is dominant in rocks of the Minas Series.
The Rio das Velhas uplift occurs east of the Moeda syncline. It is a northwest- to north-trending anti-

clinorium made up of Nova Lima rocks on the west flank and Maquine rocks in the Vargem do Lima syncline to the east of the uplift (Gair, 1962, p. 49). Eocks of the Eio das Velhas uplift have been metamorphosed at least twice. They are now at the greenschist facies, generally within the chlorite isograd but biotite is found in places.
Eetrograde metarnorphism may have accompanied or followed a deformation some time after the 1,350 m.y. post-Minas orogeny. It is a moot point whether or not the first metamorphism of the Eio das Velhas rocks was a high-grade rnetamorphism that was masked by late retrograde metamorphism which imposed a widely developed greenschist facies. Foliation or cleavage is generally well developed and bedding is not well shown in the Eio das Velhas rocks (fig. 1), whereas bedding is well preserved in rocks of Minas age.

greenschist facies, a higher grade than that bounded by the chlorite isograd is shown by the presence of biotite in pelitic rocks (fig. 2).

Quartz (q) comprises about 20 percent of the rock; it forms laminae about 0.5 mm thick in which grains are less than 0.15 mm. Sericite (s) is about 50 percent of the rock, forms bands about 3 mm thick, and is iiitergrown with chlorite (c) which forms clots, and composes about 25 percent of the rock. Accessories include altered sphene and leucoxene, tourmaline magnetite, and zoisite.

Chlorite (c) comprises about 80 percent of the rock with lengths as much as 0.1 mm. Flakes penetrate edges of quartz grains. Quartz (q) comprises about 15 percent, both in grains less than 0.1 mm scattered through the chlorite, and in isolated recrystallized augen up to 1 mm. Altered sphene, leucoxene (opaque), and sericite are accessory. This may be a metavolcanic rock, as indicated by the large amount of chlorite and the quartz augen representing phenocrysts.
The greenschist facies is typically shown in finegrained pelites by the assemblage chlorite-muscovitequartz, in quartzites by muscovite-hematite-chlorite or chloritoid-chlorite-hematite, and in carbonate rocks by dolomite-quartz-chlorite-muscovite. Locally within the

In the Nova Lima, Belo Horizonte, and Ibirite quadrangles (Gair, 1962; Pomerene, 1964), the grade of metamorphism rises north of the Serra do Curral from the chlorite to the staurolite isograd and the rock becomes coarser grained and porphyroblastic as it approaches the granite contact. Chlorite, biotite, garnet, and staurolite isograds appear to parallel both the bedding in rocks of the Minas Series and the
granite contact, but some of the higher grade minerals underwent retrograde metamorphism at a later time. Structural complications east of the Nova Lima quadrangle, in the Piedade and Santa Luzia quadrangles, make isograds difficult to map, but high-grade minerals have been found there. West of the Ibirite quadrangle, deep weathering has made mapping of isograds impossible, but Simmons (1968a, p. 31) has found garnet in the Sabara Formation as it approaches the granite contact.
Dynamic metamorphism has affected rocks in the western part of the Quadrilatero Ferrifero in general.

crushed quartz. Belts of extremely fine-grained quartzite, which strongly resemble Arkansas novaculite, extend for several kilometers north of the Serra do Curral in the Ibirite quadrangle (Pomerene, 1964, p. 28) (fig. 4). Feldspathization of the fine-grained quartzite and of Moeda quartzite near Samambaia (Pomerene, 1964, p. 32) occurred in zones parallel to the contact with gneiss, north and south of the Serra do Curral. Feldspathized zones are generally 5 mm to 1 m thick and are attributed to metasomatism by alkali-rich solutions. (See the section entitled, "Alkali Metasomatism.")
Kyanite occurs in quartz veins in aluminous chloritoid quartzite of the Moeda and Palmital Formations in the Gandarela quadrangle and may represent "recrystallization pegmatites" (Ramberg, 1952, p. 252). The Al content of the kyaiiite may have been largely derived from the country rock (Herz and Dutra, 1964).

SOUTHWESTERN PART
The Serra da Moeda separates the granitic rocks in the western part of the Quadrilatero Ferrifero from the Moeda syncliiie, a major structural feature in rocks of the Miiias Series, in the southwestern part.
Wallace (1965) has shown the Moeda syncline to be W-shaped in cross section, to have a north trend, and to be bounded by domelike gneissic structures both to the east and west. Rocks of the syncline are metamorphosed to greenschist facies. Toward the southern end, the syncline appears to swing to the east, passing around the south side of the Ba$ao Complex. Structures within the Moeda syncline can be explained as a result of compression between the Bagao Complex and the buttress of gneiss in the Moeda Complex to the west (Wallace, 1965, p. 31).
The Eiigeiiho fault lies between rocks of the Minas and Itacolomi Series in the Sao Juliao area and the Rio das Velhas greenschist to the south. It extends eastward from the Jeceaba quadrangle (Guild, 1957) to the eastern edge of the Quadrilatero Ferrifero (Johnson, 1962; Barbosa, A. L. M., written commun., 1965). The metamorphism of the area is generally of the greenschist facies but the grade appears to rise in the pre-Minas sediments south of the Engenho fault and also near granitic contacts.
Pelitic rocks in the Moeda syncline typically contain fine-grained assemblages of quartz-sericite-chlorite

CIO

REGIONAL GEOLOGY OF THE QUADRILATERO FERRIFERO, MINAS GERAIS, BRAZIL

or quartz-chloritoid-chlorite and accessory hematite or magnetite. Quartzite generally has cataclastic textures. Carbonate rocks are almost entirely dolomite and quartz, but they have accessory chlorite, muscovite, hematite, magnetite, talc, and tremolite or anthophyllite and, rarely, pyrite. Itabirite contains mostly quartz and specularite or quartz, dolomite, and magnetite, but it may grade into schistose itabirite containing either quartz, dolomite, magnetite, and actinolite, or quartz, magnetite, and antinolite.
Metamorphic anomalies in these low-grade rocks appear in the southwestern part of the Quadrilatero Ferrifero, as they do to the north. Northeast of Pogo Fundo, for example, fine-grained quartz-muscovitemagnetite phyllite of the Itacolomi Series has porphyroblasts of kyanite, garnet, chloritoid, and muscovite. Guild (1957, p. 38) attributes the porphyroblasts northeast of Pogo Fundo and similar occurrences elsewhere to a temporary temperature rise during thrusting.
Kyanite commonly occurs as uiioriented ragged grains along minute fractures and as rosettes on bedding planes in quartzite and phyllite of the Miiias and Itacolomi Series. Guild thinks the kyanite is hydrothermal in origin, but evidence presented later in this report indicates that it is related to bulk chemical composition and high pressure during metamorphism. (See the section entitled, "Kyanite.")
The grade of metamorphism appears to increase southward from the Engenho fault, but zoning could not be mapped in detail because of poor exposures. Schists rich in plagioclase-quartz-biotite and quartzhornblende-epidote are common, and a biotite-almandine assemblage was found in Congonhas in a drill hole into schist near a contact with granodiorite. Metamorphism in this area thus appears to be of the upper greenschist and lower amphibolite facies.
Intrusions of granodiorite in the extreme southern part of the area may have caused contact metamorphism; a later, largely deformational, event was responsible for retrograde effects. Near intrusions, sericitic phyllites and schists are coarser grained and contain biotite and almandine, which in some rocks was replaced by chlorite. Deformed ultramafic bodies in the Congonhas district are altered to talcose chlorite amphibole schist and are strongly foliated. Also present in that area is massive steatite containing talc, ankerite, actinolite, amphibole asbestos, and pyrite.
In places along the Minas Series-granite contact west of the Serra da Moeda, a gneissic rock, probably derived from Rio das Velhas sediments, is found. The gneiss contains quartz, microcline, muscovite, oligo-

clase, biotite, and epidote, and minor calcite, allanite, and sphene. In adjacent basal rocks of the Minas Series, the only contact effects of the granite intrusion are tourmaline-quartz veins and a 5-m-wide feldspathized zone.
BACAO COMPLEX
The Bagao Complex is a domelike structure of granitic, granodioritic, and gneissic rocks of more than one age (Herz and others, 1961). The northern part of the complex intrudes metasedimentary rock of the Rio das Velhas Series (J. E. O'Rourke, written commun., 1954). Many large areas of metasedimentary rock occur but are not mapped in the granitic rocks of the Bagao Complex and small bodies of granitic rock occur in areas of metasedimentary rock adjacent to the complex. Mappable outliers of granite are common north of the complex (Wallace, 1965).
Metasedimentary rock of the Rio das Velhas is continuous around the west and east sides of the complex. In places along the south side of the complex, Minas rocks are in contact with gneiss, but, in general, a thin septum of Rio das Velhas rocks intervenes (Johnson, 1962; Guild, 1957). The stratified rocks of the Minas Series strike parallel to and dip away from the contact, except at the southwest and southeast corners of the complex.
A metamorphic aureole is present in the Rio das Velhas rocks surrounding the complex. The basal Minas Moeda Quartzite is almost entirely quartz, which may account for its lack of contact-metamorphic minerals adjacent to the complex. On the other hand, the presence of cummingtonite in the Caue Itabirite at the southeast corner and of pegmatite and quartztourmaline veins within the schist of the Piracicaba Group on the south edge of the complex provide evidence that the intrusions affected the Minas to some extent.
The metamorphic aureole is about 500 m wide in Rio das Velhas rocks along the west and southwest sides of the complex (Guild, 1957, p. 39). The freshest examples of contact-metamorphosed pelitic rock in that area occur as float consisting of garnet, staurolite, kyanite, sillimanite, cordierite, quartz, biotite, muscovite, and chlorite assemblages. Float fragments of relatively coarse-grained quartzite and quartz-magnetite itabirite schists also occur along the west and southwest sides of the complex. A metasedimentary gneiss in Ribeirao Sardinha is quartz-plagioclase(oligoclase - andesine) - garnet - hornblende - sillimanite:biotite. Johnson (1962, p. 26) described similar rocks along the southern margin of the complex and

METAMORPHIC ROCKS

Cll

found that assemblages of quartz-aiidesine-cummingtonite-biotite-garnet occurred in both the contact zone and in xenoliths.
Because the metamorphic aureole is only about 500 m wide, Guild (1957, p. 39) thinks that the intrusion of the granodiorite took place at shallow depths Avith rapid cooling. Because the area just south of the Bacjio Complex is much folded and faulted, it is also possible that the aureole originally was thicker but was thinned by thrust faulting. Along the northern boundary of the complex, J. E. O'Rourke (written commun., 1954) concluded that a gradational contact between biotite schist and associated amphibolite and granite gneiss was caused by metasomatism rather than by isochemical reconstitution of minerals under higher pressure/temperature cinditions.

Pereira. The whole area is generally within the chlorite metamorphic isograd but biotite appears adjacent to granite in the extreme eastern part of the Catas Altas, Santa Rita Durao, and Antonio Pereira quadrangles.
South and southeast of the Bagao Complex, quartzchlorite-muscovite assemblages are ubiquitous, and some pelitic rocks also contain biotite, chloritoid, or epidote. Albite is comparatively rare. In high-grade pelitic rocks, staurolite and associated garnet and kyanite may have formed by the breakdown of chloritoid. Alkali amphiboles occur in dolomitic itabirite of the Passagem mine (fig. 5) (Guimaraes, 1935, p. 23).

SOUTHEASTERN PART

Essentially the same structures continue eastward from south of the Bagao Complex into the southeastern part of the Quadrilatero Ferrifero. In this area, the main part of the Piracicaba Group in the upper part of the Minas Series occupies a . synclinorium, which is actually the Dom Bosco syncline (Dorr, 1969) that extends eastward south of the Serra do Ouro Preto to the eastern limit of the Quadrilatero Ferrifero. Geologic structure south of this synclinorium is extremely complicated and includes many thrust faults along which displacement to the west has occurred (Johnson, 1962; A. L. M. Barbosa, written commun., 1965). An eastward continuation of the Engenho fault and its satellite faults separates Minas and Itacolomi rocks north of the fault zone from Rio das Velhas rocks to the south. The Serra do Ouro Branco, which is composed of poorly sorted quartzites and conglomerates that are tentatively correlated by Johnson with the Caraga Group, may -a]so lie just south of this great fault.
A wide area of Nova Lima phyllite and schist lies east of the Bagao Complex and differs from that on the other sides in that biotite apparently is the highest metamorphic isograd. A higher level of metamorphism than the greenschist facies is indicated by the association of oligoclase with biotite. Staurolite-bearing assemblages may have been faulted out by thrusts from the east.
The Serra de Antonio Pereira lies east of the Nova Lima rocks, which comprise the belt east of the Bacjio Complex. The Serra is underlain by Minas rocks and its structure is much complicated by faulting. Metasedimentary rock of the Eio das Velhas Series appears again in thrust sheets east of the Serra de Antonio

Rock contains well-developed layers of magnetite (opaque, m), dolomite (d), and quartz (q). Large quartz grains are strained. Alkali amphibole (a) up to 1-2 mm, generally prismatic and poikilitic, is abundant along certain layers. It is strongly pleochroic blue-green to yellowgreen. Pyroxene (p), (acmite) forms nonpleochroic green grains. Some garnet (g) is associated with the pyroxene.
In Rio das Velhas rocks, the metamorphic grade generally increases near the south edge of the southeastern part of the Quadrilatero Ferrifero and also increases in some folds in that area (pi. 1). The staurolite isograd is common in rocks of the Itacolomi Series in some folds and may have been caused by an increase in temperature and pressure brought on by folding and thrusting. Isograds related to folds has also been observed in regions of Alpine metamorphism (Niggli, E., 1960; Vrana, 1964).
The most common assemblage of the Itabira and Piracicaba Groups in carbonate rocks is dolomite-

The most important structures in the northeastern part of the Quadrilatero Ferrifero are syiiclines in metasedimentary rocks of the Minas Series, complex anticlinoria of pre-Minas quartzites, and extensive faults, especially thrust faults. The largest syncline is the Gandarela syncline which is continuous for about 45 km from the Gandarela quadrangle in the southwest to the Sao Gongalo quadrangle in the northeast. The pre-Minas rocks appear to have been isoclinally folded and deformed both by pre- and post-Minas deformation. Syntectonic and post-tectonic granitic gneiss occurs along the northern and eastern sides of the area.
Quartzitic rocks of pre-Minas or Minas age make up the Serra das Cambotas and the Serra do Caraga. The Serra do Caraga is cut by a network of northtrending faults, some of which are thrust faults that have low dips to the east. Other faults in the Serra do Caraga trend northwest and generally follow the fault pattern.
Structures in the Bio das Velhas rocks appear to be discordant to Minas structures (Moore, 1969), but, because schistosity or axial plane cleavage is the most obvious planar structure, examples of real discordance are difficult to find.
The metamorphic grade in this area is either of the greenschist or epidote amphibolite facies, except near igneous contacts. The typical assemblage in pelitic rocks is muscovite-quartz-chlorite and locally kyanite. Grain size is generally fine but ranges to coarse. In quartz-rich phyllite of the Nova Lima Group, O'Bourke (written commun., 1954) found plagiclase porphyroblasts with accessory iron oxides, graphite,

and itabirite. The metamorphic grade increases near igneous con-
tacts, but intense weathering prevents the mapping of contact aureoles. Contact aureoles occur in the extreme north and east parts of the Quadrilatero Ferrifero, near intrusive granitic rock as well as east and southeast of the Serra do Caraga near a metamorphosed ultramafic intrusive sequence. Shattered crystals of almandine-rich garnet as much as 2 cm in diameter occur in chlorite-muscovite schist and phyllite in the extreme eastern part of the area and near granite contacts throughout the area. Original sedimentary rocks adjacent to the ultramafic body contain garnet, staurolite, and kyanite. Magnetite crystals are found in nearperfect octahedra as much as 7 cm in diameter in the Catas Altas quadrangle, as well as large limonite pseudomorphs after pyrite crystals (Maxwell, 1972). Small quartz-tourmaline veins are possibly related to the intense faulting and regional shearing.
Maxwell (1972) described a transition zone of migmatite between pre-Minas rocks and Santa Barbara gneiss in the eastern part of the Catas Altas and Santa Bita Durao quadrangles and attributed it to pneumatolytic metamorphism. In the Cocais quadrangle Simmons (1968b) found evidence of contact metamorphism of quartzite adjacent to Cocais gneiss north of the Serra do Tamandua. The zone immediately adjacent to the gneiss contains large potassium-feldspar porphyroblasts and coarse muscovite plus plagioclase Ab85_95, biotite and epidote. Beyond this inner zone is a median zone containing similar porphyroblasts of potassium-feldspar and muscovite, and beyond this is an outer zone of sheared quartzite.

Dorr and Barbosa (1963) pointed out that in similar paragneiss in the Itabira area, bedding has generally been eliminated from the original Rio das Velhas rocks, the gneiss has much coarser grain sizes than rocks of the Minas Series, and that hornblende- and biotite-bearing schists are much more common in the paragneiss than in Minas rocks.

CHLORITE
Chlorite is one of the most abundant minerals in the metasedimentary rocks of the Quadrilatero Ferrifero. It is found in such diverse rocks as quartzite, ironformation, dolomite, phyllite, and schist and in different metamorphic environments from the staurolite zone to the greenschist facies.
Chlorite, when associated with muscovite, is generally assumed to represent rocks of the lowest grade

No metamorphic aureoles were mapped in this area because of deeply weathered as well as sparse outcrops. It can be seen, however, that the Rio das Velhas pelitic rocks have been more highly metamorphosed than those of the Minas: (1) assemblages of garnet, staurolite, and kyanite may crop out for as much as 200 m in the Rio das Velhas and for only about 10 m in the
lowermost Piracicaba (Dorr and Barbosa, 1963, p. 53-54) ; (2) bedding is no longer visible in most Rio das Velhas pelites, whereas it is seen in all Minas rocks; (3) amphibolites and biotite-rich rocks are seen only in the Rio das Velhas; and (4) the Minas rocks are generally finer grained than those of the Rio das Velhas.

of metamorphism, and, together with albite, epidote, and actinolite, it is diagnostic of the greenschist facies (Fyfe and others, 1958, p. 217). In Si- or K-poor rock assemblages, Mg-rich chlorite can be associated with almandine and is stable at temperatures greatly exceeding those attributed to the greenschist facies (Yoder, 1952).
Nelson and Roy (1958) found, on the basis of laboratory investigations, that the stability of chlorite was also a function of crystal structure. At temperatures below about 500°C, two-layered chlorite (or 7 A) is stable; from 500° to 700°C, four-layered (or 14 A) is the stable form. The former is generally finer

Quartzites of the Minas Series have been recrystallized and have an interlocking mosaic fabric. Coarsegrained muscovite is ubiquitous and biotite, potassiumfeldspar, and plagioclase may also be present. Common accessory minerals are zircon, apatite, staurolite, kyanite, garnet, and opaques. Although the min-

OPTICAL DETERMINATION

FIGURE 6. Photomicrograph, schist, Nova Lima Group, near granite contact, R-104-52, Itabirito quadrangle, plane light. Crenulation of interleaved and interbanded biotite (b) and chlorite (c) bands is pronounced. Garnet (g) has snowball structure in places or is fractured, and has kelyphitic, chloritic rims. Quartz (q) recrystallized in elongate grains. Platelike opaque mineral may be ilmenite.

In thin section, chlorite is seen either as fine-grained mats in the rock groundmass (fig. 1) or as larger discordant or concordant porphyroblasts that may average 1 mm in diameter. The first is typical of the lowest and intermediate grades of metamorphism found in the Quadrilatero Ferrifero; the second, of the intermediate and highest grades.
The median index of refraction was determined for many chlorite samples in different geologic environments and was used to divide the samples into low-, medium-, and high-iron (tables 3 and 4). Indices below 1.61, including such types as diabantite, pycnochlorite, and penniiiite, are here called low iron (high magnesia); between 1.61 and 1.63, including diabantite, brunsvigite, and ripidolite, medium iron; and indices above 1.63, ripidolite and brunsvigite, high iron (low magnesia) (from Hey, 1954).
In a general way, depth of pleochroism, in shades of yellow-green to colorless, increases with increasing index of refraction.

CHEMICAL ANALYSES
Chemical analyses were obtained on two samples (table 5), the first of which is from the biotite zone, although it does not have any biotite, and the second, from the chlorite zone. Because of the fine grain size of the chlorite and abundance of intermixed material, separation of pure samples was difficult. The high amount of CaO in both samples suggests either the presence of associated silicates or interlayering with clay minerals (Foster, 1962, p. 2).
Although neither sample was completely pure, certain conclusions can be drawn from the analyses. JG-28-55, from within the biotite isograd, has a lower Fe total/Fe + Mg ratio and a high Al4c/SiAl4c (4c=4 coordination) ratio than J-548 which is within the chlorite isograd. This agrees with observations elsewhere that chlorite stable under conditions of higher metamorphism is generally a Mg- and Al-rich variety. Ramberg (1952, p. 59) postulated the change muscovite + Al-poor chlorite-»biotite + Al-rich chlorite + quartz + water with the onset of conditions of the biotite zone. Fawcett and Yoder (1966, p. 378) found that the assemblage chlorite+quartz was stable to

about 600° 5kb PH2O, if the chlorite contained about 23 percent A12O3 ; Turnock (1960) found that at 2,000 bars pressure synthetic Fe-chlorite broke down at about 100°-150° lower than did Mg-rich chlorite.

ASSEMBLAGES

Chlorite of low metamorphic grade (table 3) was found typically in phyllites, greenstones, quartzites and ferruginous quartzites, dolomite, and fine-grained schists. The most common mineral assemblage throughout most of the phyllitic and quartzitic rocks of the Quadrilatero Ferrifero includes chlorite with sericite and quartz, with or without plagioclase (An0_5 ) or chloritoid (fig. 18). Hematite is the most common opaque mineral; others are ilmenite, pyrite, magnetite, and limonite. Tourmaline, epidote, sphene, and carbonate are common accessory minerals.
In dolomitic rocks of the Gandarela Formation east and west of Sao Juliao, chlorite is associated with dolomite and quartz; accessory minerals are magnetite, white mica, hematite or limonite, and rarely, rutile. In some carbonate-facies iron-formation in the Nova Lima quadrangle, deep-green chlorite occurs together with quartz, sideritic carbonate, magnetite, and accessory minerals (Gair, 1962, p. 17). A high median index of refraction of about 1.66 shows that the chlorite is iron rich. In ferruginous quartzites, chlo-
rite, hematite, and quartz are accessory minerals; and in greenstones, accessory minerals are epidote, quartz, sericite, and magnetite.
In greenschist, the assemblages are either chlorite tremolite-actinolite-apatite, or epidote (abundant)white mica-quartz-magnetite-albite-carbonate-sphene.
Chlorite occurs in schists, dolomites, and greenstones in higher grades of metamorphism (table 4), especially in the biotite zone, but also in the garnet zone. In preMinas felsic metavolcanic rocks, chlorite appears to have replaced former mafic phenocrysts (fig. 7).
In schistose rocks of moderate grade, as in the Sabara Formation of the Ibirite and Nova Lima quadrangles, chlorite is associated with quartz, biotite, muscovite, and epidote, with or without sodic oligoclase (about Ani5_2o), apatite, and opaque minerals (fig. 14). Microcline where present is abundant. In dolomitic rocks of the Dom Bosco quadrangle, chlorite is associated with quartz, dolomite, magnetite, with or without oligoclase (An20 ), tremolite, biotite, and muscovite. In greenstone-amphibolite just south of the Bacao complex, chlorite is a retrograde metamorphic product derived from hornblende; other associated minerals are sodic andesine (about An25_45 ), biotite, epidote and sphene.
Chlorite is found in metadiabase throughout the area. In the Ibirite and Capanema quadrangles, where metadiabase porphyry occurs, chlorite is abundant in the groundmass; other minerals are albite (An0 ), carbonate, muscovite, biotite, quartz, potassium-feld-

spar, and minor amounts of epidote, opaque minerals, and leucoxene.
A chlorite, presumably high in magnesia, is found in staurolite-garnet schist in the most highly metamorphosed part of the Sabara Formation in the northwestern part of the Quadrilatero Ferrifero. Quartz and muscovite are essential constituents; other minerals include Ca-oligoclase, tourmaline, and iron oxides. The chlorite is fine to medium grained and has persisted as a metastable form through progressive metamorphism. In other samples, it may have developed by retrogressive metamorphism of biotite (fig. 2). A metamorphic assemblage of the apparent high grade south and west of the Bagao complex includes chlorite and kyanite together with muscovite, quartz, and magnetite; accessory minerals are garnet and tourmaline.
CHROMIAN CHLORITE
Some chlorite, especially that associated with gold deposits, is unusually high in Cr. In six samples of chlorite from chloritic schist of the Raposos mine, Nova Lima quadrangle, Cr ranges from 0.072 to 0.580 percent; in seven samples from the Morro Velho mine, Nova Lima quadrangle, Cr ranges from 0.022 to 0.31

FIGURE 8. Photomicrograph, chlorite schist, pre-Minas rocks, Z-229A, Rio de Pedras quadrangle, plane light. Shear planes are filled with fine opaque matter and are alined more or less parallel to compositional layering. Quartz and oligoclase are essential minerals; sericite, sulfide, and magnetite are accessories. Large biotite (b) lies across layering, and is cut by shear planes; coarse chlorite (c) is in the "shadow." Large oligoclase grains have irregular quartz inclusions and occur in places, with chlorite, on carbonate (ca).

tween refractive indices of biotite and its associated chlorite is linear, of even slope, and has the indices of the biotite about 0.02 higher than the corresponding indices of chlorite (fig. 9). Thus Mg/Fe ratios of the two minerals vary uniformly and compositional tielines would not cross, which suggests formation under approximate equilibrium conditions.
In many rocks, the partial pressure of oxygen, whose fugacity was buffered by the FeO/Fe2O3 ratio, apparently determined whether chlorite or biotite would crystallize. In rocks containing hematite alone, chlorite crystallized readily (fig. 10), whereas, in rocks which have a lower oxygen fugacity and which contain magnetite as well as hematite, biotite also appears to have

been stable under otherwise similar physical conditions of metamorphism (fig. 2). In places, biotite appears to have formed by contact reaction between chlorite and magnetite (fig. 11).
These observations agree in part with the experimental work of Eugster and Wones (1962) on the stability field of the Fe-rich biotite, annite. They found that at about 430 °C and higher oxygen fugacities than determined by the magnetite-hematite buffer, annite was unstable. At lower oxygen fugacities, using buffers that included magnetite but not hematite, arinitequartz-magnetite is a stable association. At higher oxygen fugacities, hematite is stable but annite and magnetite break down.
WEATHERING
Chlorite-rich phyllites and schists are especially susceptible to weathering and occupy topographic lowlands in most places. Chlorite generally alters to a compact clay mineral of indeterminate composition.
WHITE MICAS
"White" micas described in this report are muscovite and sericite, KAl3Si3Oi0 (OH) 2, the chromian mica, fuchsite, and possibly the aluminum mica pyrophyllite.

White micas are common in almost every type of rock, except iron-formation, and in every metamorphic environment. In low-grade metamorphic rocks, the white mica is generally fine grained, forms mats, and may be associated with chlorite. In high-grade metamorphic rocks, discrete larger flakes occur amidst the fine-grained sericite.
White micas are thus stable from the lowest metamorphic grade to the amphibolite facies, that is, through a range of about 650°C (Eamberg, 1952). Yoder (1959) has shown that at a water vapor pressure of 2,000 bars, corresponding to a depth of about 8 km, paragonite is stable to about 650 °C and muscovite, to about 700°C. Between 250°C and 350°C at about 1,000 bars Pn2o,, the muscovite polymorphs change from a one-layer monoclinic form (1M) to a two-layer monoclinic (2M) form (Yoder and Eugster, 1955, p. 246).
These relationships were determined in silica-deficient environments, however, and should be considered only qualitative. In quartz-bearing assemblages such as are typical of the Quadrilatero Ferrifero, muscovite should break down at lower temperatures than indicated by Yoder and Eugster to potassiumfeldspar+Al2SiO5 +H2O (Turner and Yerhoogen, 1960, p. 520).
OPTICAL DETERMINATION
The intermediate indices of refraction of many muscovite micas were determined to see if they varied either with type of rock or grade of metamorphism. According to Winchell and Winchell (1951, p. 368), lower indices are to be expected in aluminum or magnesium-rich varieties and higher indices in ferric-rich varieties. The optical properties, however, were not found to vary systematically in the Quadrilatero Ferrifero, so that muscovite of any given mineral association had variable optical properties from one sample to another.
Of 40 determinations of the intermediate index of refraction of white micas, 11 (or 28 percent) fall between 1.586 and 1.591 and 16 (or 41 percent) fall between 1.598 and 1.605. These indices are within the limits of 1.582-1.610 for B of "normal muscovites" (Deer and others, 1962b, p. 21). Eocks of all types and grades of metamorphism are represented within both the lower and higher groupings.
Fuchsite and other chromian micas were easily distinguished from muscovite in thin section. The indices of refraction are similar, but fuchsite shows pleochroism, generally from colorless to yellowish-green, whereas muscovite has no color.
Pyrophyllite is associated with kyanite in veins,

The 2V's of seven pyrophyllite samples determined on a 4-axis universal stage varied from 52° to 63° and averaged about 58° (Herz and Dutra, 1964). These 2V's are higher than those in muscovite, which are all below 45°.

THE PROBLEM OF PARAGONITE
The appearance of paragonite in metamorphic rocks of the chlorite through kyanite zones probably depends on the bulk composition, especially the A12O3K2O/ Na2O ratio. Presumably A12O3 should exceed the amount needed to make feldspar, but Na2O should also be abundant. The pelitic rocks of the Quadrilatero Ferrifero have an unusually high proportion of both A12O3 and K2O and a low proportion of Na2O (Herz, 1962); therefore very little, if any, paragonite was formed. Average ratios in the Quadrilatero Ferrifero are Al2O3/Na2O = 8.42 and SiO2/K2O = 12.7 compared with 9.6 and 16.9, respectively, for worldwide lowgrade pelitic rocks (Shaw, 1956, p. 928). The A12O3/ K2O ratio, however, was ideal for the formation of abundant muscovite, and sodium must have gone into both paragonite, held in solid solution with muscovite, and albite, rather than into paragonite as a separate phase.
Because paragonite has been so widely reported in metamorphic rocks (Zen and Albee, 1964, p. 907), a search for this mineral was made by X-ray diffractometer. Mineral assemblages in 12 specimens were determined in the 20 region from 7° to about 60° (Cu K radiation, Ni filter) (table 6 and fig. 12). In this range, paragonite should yield strong basal reflections at 20 of about 9.2°, 18.4°, 27.7°, and 47.3° (Zen and others, 1964).
The strong reflections of muscovite in the ,X-ray diffractograms show that it is well crystallized and that paragonite did not form as a separate phase. In both samples, plagioclase is present, proving that sufficient Na2O was present to form a distinct mineral phase. Some Na2O probably did enter muscovite as

MUSCOVITE ASSEMBLAGES
Throughout the area, fine-grained muscovite (sericite), quartz, and chlorite make up the bulk of the phyllites -and low-grade schists. In many low- and medium-grade rocks, muscovite with both a fine and medium grain size is found (fig. 13). In the rocks of highest metamorphic grade, most of the sericite has

disappeared and coarse muscovite predominates (fig.
31). Chloritoid, kyanite, and hematite or magnetite or
both are associated with quartz-chlorite-muscovite in some of the low-grade pelitic rocks. Graphite is a common accessory, and epidote, sphene, and tourmaline are rare accessory minerals. In low-grade carbonate rocks, typified by the dolomitic rocks of the

Rock is composed almost entirely of quartz (q) and sericite-museovite(s), and has minor amounts of limonite (opaque, 1). Coarser-grained muscovite has two preferred orientations. Limonite may have replaced biotite or chloritoid.

Gandarela Formation in the Dom Bosco quadrangle (Johnson, 1962, p. 14), muscovite is associated with phlogopite and magnetite, and in places with epidote.
At the biotite isograd, sericite combined with available chlorite to form biotite (fig. 3). Most of the finegrained white mica, however, only recrystallized to coarser grain sizes (fig. 14). Some coarse-grained muscovite near contacts with granitic rocks may be partly the result of metasomatism by potassium-rich solutions.
Assemblages of muscovite-chlorite-quartz have in part given rise to veins of andalusite-muscovite-quartz and corundum-muscovite-feldspar at a granite contact north of Belo Horizonte and Sabara (Pomerene, 1964, p. 36). Because the material is badly weathered, it is difficult to tell exactly what mineral reactions took place, the nature of the feldspar, and whether other minerals also formed. The metamorphic grade here is best described as the lowest level of the pyroxene-hornfels facies (Turner and Verhoogen, 1960, p. 521).
North of Sabara in the Nova Lima quadrangle (Gair, 1962) sericite has broken down to form potassium-feldspar and biotite (fig. 15). In that area and elsewhere, however, some coarse-grained muscovite persists at the highest metamorphic grades reached

in the Quadrilatero Ferrifero, which suggests that conditions of the amphibolite facies were nowhere exceeded (Ramberg, 1952, p. 151). The coarse-grained muscovite typically is associated with quartz and: (1) kyanite, with accessory chlorite and garnet; (2) chlorite, calcic oligoclase, and accessory carbonate, magnetite, biotite, and sphene; (3) biotite with or without magnetite or garnet and tremolite.
FUCHSITE
Fuchsite and Cr-rich muscovites have been found in the basal part of the Moeda quartzite near granite contacts, in the Rio das Velhas and Minas Series near fault zones, and in some other quartzitic rocks (Herz, in Dorr and others, 1959/1961, p. 104). Near many of these occurrences, native gold-bearing sulfides of probable metasomatic origin have also been found. The association of fuchsite with these ore minerals strongly suggests that chrome-bearing solutions of metasomatic origin gave rise to the fuchsite. Fuchsite-bearing rocks are most common in the Nova Lima quadrangle and vicinity.
Tolbert (1964, p. 785) studied samples from the hanging wall in the Raposos mine, Nova Lima quadrangle, and found that chromian sericite averages slightly less than 0.5 percent chromium and that chlorite averages 0.3 percent chromium. The indices of refraction of a chromian sericite containing 0.84 percent chromium are: a =1.565, £ = 1.598, y = 1.600, and 2V = 22°-28°.
Gair (1962) found that fuchsite was abundant in a wide variety of rocks in the Rio das Velhas Series. The fuchsite is less than 0.1 mm in size in all these rocks and ranges from amounts greater than 15 percent in quartz-sericite schist and phyllite and in carbonate-rich schist to less than 5 percent in metavolcanicschist (table?).
PYROPHYLLITE
Pyrophyllite, associated with kyanite in veins and in phyllitic and quartzitic country rock, formed by the retrogressive metamorphism of kyanite is discussed further in the section on "Kyanite."
WEATHERING
Rocks rich in muscovite and sericite generally are very susceptible .to weathering and tend to form topographic lowlands. The "weathering products of muscovite and sericite are clay minerals of indeterminate composition.

BIOTITE
Biotite is commonly found in medium- to highgrade metamorphic rocks of appropriate chemical composition. These include pelitic schist, amphibolite, impure layered carbonate rock, greenstone, and carbonate iron-formation. In phyllite and low-grade itabirite, it is rare.
In many areas, as in the southwest part of the Rio Acima quadrangle (Gair, 1962, p. 52), the development of biotite in low-grade rocks is attributed to the thermal effects of nearby mafic intrusives. Where there has been no igneous activity, a spotty occurrence of biotite may indicate early and local development of the biotite regional isograd or incomplete retrograde metamorphism.
The appearance of biotite is taken to represent the middle range of the greenschist facies of regional metamorphism, that is, 'PH2o,± 5,000 bars, T±400°C (Turner and Verhoogen, 1960, p. 534) where sericite and chlorite react to form biotite. With an increase in the grade of metamorphism, biotite becomes more deeply pleochroic, acquires higher refractive indices, and presumably is richer in iron (Harker, 1939, p. 217).
According to Wones and Eugster (1959, p. 132), the magnesium-iron ratio of biotite is largely dependent on the oxidation potential during metamorphism. Under relatively reducing conditions, as shown by assemblages containing graphite and magnetite, iron-rich biotite will crystallize; with relatively oxidizing conditions, shown by assemblages containing magnetite and hematite, magnesium-rich biotite forms. Excess silica also reduces the stability field of ironrich biotite. In the presence of quartz, biotite + quartz <->potassium-feldspar + hypersthene + water (Ram-

berg, 1952, p. 152). Because of the normal abundance of water in metamorphic rocks, however, it is not until the granulite facies is reached, at temperatures above 550 °C, that the equation tends to go to the right. In the Quadrilatero Ferrifero, biotite was preserved in the most highly metamorphosed rocks of the area because of the abundance of water.
OPTICAL DETERMINATION
The biotite gamma index of refraction was determined in 39 selected samples to determine if the index varies with rock type and grade of metamorphism

(table 8). An approximate measure of the proportion of the phlogopite molecule (KMg3AlSi3Oio(OH) 2 ) was obtained using the curve of Eugster and Wones (1958, p. 194) for synthetic biotites. The biotites were divided as follows:

ASSEMBLAGES

The high-magnesium biotites are found principally in carbonate rocks, dolomitic iron-formation (fig. 25), and pelitic rocks in much of the Quadrilatero Ferrifero (table 8, low annite). Biotite is porphyroblastic and developed at comparatively low temperatures of metamorphism at the expense of muscovite (sericite) and chlorite (fig. 15). With increasing metamorphism, biotite comprises foliae of the rock and is commonly interleaved with coarse-grained chlorite or muscovite. High-magnesium biotite also developed as a contact reaction between chlorite and magnetite in greenstone of the Gandarela Formation, Dom Bosco quadrangle
Biotite having an intermediate iron-magnesium ratio occurs in pelitic rocks, amphibolite, and carbonate rock of both high and moderate metamorphic grade, at which it commonly developed largely at the expense of chlorite (figs. 16, 30, 31) (table 8, intermediate annite). In the rocks of higher metamorphic grade, biotite is one of the last minerals to develop and commonly is the coarsest grained of all. Biotite-rich layers often are also rich in magnetite, whereas nearby layers without magnetite are still chloritic. Apparently higher oxygen fugacities, buffered by hematite, inhibited the development of biotite, for biotite is common in quartzmagnetite-carbonate itabirite, as in the Passagem gold mine, and is absent in the more common quartz-hematite itabirite.
Biotite having a high iron-magnesium ratio occurs both in amphibolite in the eastern part of the Quadrilatero Ferrifero, as in the Monlevade quadrangle, and

FIGURE 16. Photomicrograph, pre-Minas chlorite schist, near granite contact, Z-100, Rio de Pedras quadrangle, plane light. Rock is composed largely of fine- and medium-grained chlorite (c) replaced by porphyroblasts of biotite. Eiotite (b) is pleochroic brown and contains inclusions of quartz. Sericite interleaved with chlorite and quartz (q) form abundant elongate grains and pods. Opaques are magnetite and sulfides. Interlayers (not shown) are rich in clinozoisite, quartz, and a colorless amphibole.
RETROGRADE METAMORPHISM AND WEATHERING
Biotite has broken down readily during weathering and dynamic metamorphism to Fe-Mg chlorite, muscovite, and quartz (fig. 24). Near contacts with granitic rocks, as north of the Serra do Curral, hydrothermal solutions may have aided the breakdown of biotite to chlorite, epidote, sericite, and quartz. A penninite chlorite replaced deep-brown pleochroic biotite, typically found in amphibolites, and chlorite plus sericite replaced paler pleochroic biotite typical of schists.
In parts of the Sabara Formation in the Belo

METAMORPHIC ROCKS

C25

Horizonte and Nova Lima quadrangles, many rocks of high metamorphic grade underwent such retrogressive metamorphism under lower conditions of the greenschist facies (Gair, 1962, p. 52). In addition to biotite breaking down largely to chlorite, staurolite was replaced by sericite and quartz, hornblende by biotite and chlorite, and other amphiboles by chlorite.
FELDSPAR
Plagioclase and potassium-feldspar are not nearly as common in the metamorphic rocks of the Quadrilatero Ferrifero as they are in other Precambriaii areas. Albite, Aiio_7, is considered diagnostic of the greenschist facies (Turner and Verhoogen, 1960, p. 533). In the almandine-amphibolite facies somewhere in the garnet zone the composition of plagioclase changes abruptly to oligoclase-andesine Ani5_35 (Turner and Verhoogen, 1960, p. 544). In the almandineamphibolite facies, microcline may crystallize in rocks containing excess silica, alumina, and potassium. At the highest pressure/temperature conditions of the almandine-amphibolite facies, however, orthoclase crystallizes instead of microcline (Turner and Verhoogen, 1960, p. 549).
POTASSIUM FELDSPAR
Potassium-feldspar was identified optically. Plaidtwinned grains are called microcline; in assemblages of high metamorphic grade, grains that are not plaidtwinned are called orthoclase. Microcline is associated with albitic plagioclase and appears to have developed best in quartz-rich rocks near contacts with granitic bodies, for example, north of the Bagao Complex. In such rocks, it tends to form large augen-shaped aggregates. In other quartzose-gneiss, microcline is associated with quartz and muscovite and albite or oligoclase; biotite, tourmaline, chlorite, iron oxides, epidote, and sphene may or may not be present. In rocks in which microcline is abundant, it is medium to coarse grained and hypidiomorphic; otherwise, it is fine grained and granular. In metamorphosed arkose and graywacke, microcline occurs as detrital grains, such as in the Sabara Formation near the southwestern corner of the Belo Horizonte quadrangle.
Orthoclase appears in relatively high-temperature assemblages near contacts between country rock and granite bodies and it increases in amount as muscovite diminishes. In the contact zones north of the Serra do Curral and the Bagao Complex, orthoclase occurs in association with quartz, biotite, and oligoclase-andesine and, in places, also with garnet, epidote, magne-

tite, chlorite, and muscovite. Orthoclase occurs in amphibolite in association with hornblende, oligoclase, and chlorite, most notably in the southwestern part of the Sao Juliao quadrangle.
PLAGIOCLASE
OPTICAL DETERMINATION
Plagioclase was determined largely by measurements of the indices of refraction of cleavage flakes (Tsuboi, in Winchell and Winchell, 1951, p. 280) and in thin sections by measuring the maximum extinction angle in albite twins in the zone normal to 010 (Winchell and Winchell, 1951) on a flat stage or with a 4-axis universal stage (Slemmons, 1962).
ASSEMBLAGES
Plagioclase of composition An0_35 occurs in phyllite, schist, and quartzitic rock throughout the area in association with quartz, chlorite, and muscovite. The most common accessory minerals in these assemblages are epidote and biotite; others are potassium-feldspar, carbonate, magnetite, hematite, apatite, sphene, and tourmaline. In many rocks containing plagioclase Ani5_S5 and abundant biotite, either muscovite or chlorite may also be present. Rocks containing plagioclase An0_i0 are common throughout the area and contain muscovite, quartz, albite, and epidote, and, in places, sphene, magnetite, zircon, potassium-feldspar and chlorite.
Quartz and albitic feldspar commonly form myrmekite, indicative of late magmatic or deuteric crystallization (Howell, 1957, p. 195) (fig. 43), but in places plagioclase is the last mineral to form and replaces both quartz and muscovite.
Plagioclase also occurs in rocks of higher metamorphic grade, such as amphibolite or biotite-staurolite schist. In such rocks it ranges from oligoclase to andesine. The grain size of plagioclase generally increases with increasing metamorphism.
In most metamorphic rocks, plagioclase rarely is twinned or else it is twinned in broad bands according to the albite law. Some plagioclase associated with amphibole, staurolite, and garnet, is twinned polysynthetically.
In amphibolite, plagioclase is universally associated with hornblende. Adjacent to the Bagao Complex, assemblages include epidote; other associated minerals and corresponding plagioclase compositions are: biotite with An20-35, quartz-biotite with An19_37, quartz

C26 REGIONAL GEOLOGY OF THE QUADRILATERO FERRIFERO, MINAS GERAIS, BRAZIL

with An25-59, and quartz-biotite-garnet with An25_3o. Common accessory minerals are carbonate, sphene, ilmenite, leucoxene, apatite, magnetite, allanite, and pyrite.
In schist and gneiss of high metamorphic grade, as in the Monlevade quadrangle (Beeves, 1966), plagioclase, An15-355 is associated with staurolite, biotite, and locally also with garnet, muscovite (most common with more albitic plagioclase), and magnetite.
Roof pendants of schist or amphibolite in the Bagao Complex (for example, Cachoeira do Campo quadrangle, S. 2,300, W. 3,700) contain biotite, tremolite or cummingtonite, and plagioclase, An52_645 and, in places, also quartz, epidote, and garnet.
PLAGIOCLASE MAP
A map has been prepared to show distribution of anorthite variation in plagioclase (pi. 1). In most of the area, albite is the dominant plagioclase in metasedimentary rocks away from igneous contacts and even in rocks near granite contacts in the western part of the Serra da Moeda. Albite near granite contacts may be due, in large part, to alkali metasomatism activated by a steep thermal gradient. The occurrence of albite at a distance from granitic bodies suggests metamorphism in the greenschist facies.
Plagioclase more calcic than albite is closely related to relatively high-grade thermal metamorphism at many igneous contacts in the northern and eastern parts of the Quadrilatero Ferrifero and in the area of the Bac.ao Complex. In the Bac.ao Complex oligoclase and andesine also occur in roof pendants.
Oligoclase-andesine occurs in the area northeast of the Bac.ao Complex, largely within the Vargem de Lima syncline, and especially in rocks of the Maquine Group. This feldspar appears to be a direct product of a post-Minas isochemical metamorphism. Some assemblages include biotite and kyaiiite which, together with oligoclase-andesine, suggests that pressure and temperature conditions exceeded those of the greenschist facies. Oligoclase and andesine in rocks of the Nova Lima Group southwest of the town of Nova Lima may be a product of contact metamorphism adjacent to mafic and ultramafic intrusive rocks.
RETROGRADE METAMORPHISM AND WEATHERING
By retrograde metamorphism, calcic plagioclase becomes unstable and changes to clinozoisite, muscovite, and sodic plagioclase. This is well shown in the biotite gneisses and schists of the Morro da Pedra type near Belo Horizonte (Pomerene, 1964, p. 33).

Both plagioclase and potassium-feldspar weather to matted mixtures of muscovite and kaolinite(?) throughout the Quadrilatero Ferrifero. Potassiumfeldspar, however, is relatively more resistant and survives where plagioclase has been completely altered.
QUARTZ
Quartz is one of the most common minerals in the metamorphic rocks of the Quadrilatero Ferrifero. It ranges from trace amounts in some carbonate rock and iron ore to more than 90 percent in quartzites. No special metamorphic significance is attached to its presence except that it indicates that reactions proceeded in an environment of excess SiO2.
Quartz of detrital or chemical origin (as chert) formed part of the original sedimentary deposits of the region, and quartz amygdules or phenocrysts occur in metavolcanic rocks (fig. 7). Much clastic quartz underwent cataclastic deformation and recrystallization, as seen by undulatory extinction, mortar structure, and sutured boundaries, and chert was recrystallized. The higher the degree of metamorphism, the coarser the grain size (James, 1955, p. 1462). Original sedimentary textures have been partially or completely destroyed in most rocks, but are well preserved in some quartzite and carbonate rock.
Original grain boundaries, however, have been obliterated in quartzite that was engulfed by granite, such as in that intercalated with gneiss north of the Serra do Curral in the Belo Horizonte and Ibirite quadrangles (Pomerene, 1964, p. 28). Quartz in "general has a mosaic texture and grains generally range from 0.01 to 0.1 mm, averaging about 0.03 mm (fig. 4). Quartz grains as large as 1 X 0.3 mm, however, are found in similar quartzite south of the contact of granite with the Piracicaba Group; the grains are characterized by subangular or sutured boundaries and undulatory extinction. Quartz veins are exceptionally numerous in the contact area.
The geologists of the DNPM-U.S. Geological Survey project agree that quartz interbeds in the Caue Itabirite, and possibly also in some Rio das Velhas iron-formation, are of chemical origin (Guild, 1957, p. 46, figs. 5, 15-17). Fine-grained mosaic-textured quartz laminae range from 0.5 to 10 mm in thickness (fig. 17).
The grain size of quartz in itabirite is related approximately to the degree of metamorphism and increases generally to the east. In the northwestern part of the Quadrilatero Ferrifero, which is mainly in the chlorite zone, quartz ranges in grain size from 0.01

to 0.086 mm (table 9). In the extreme northeast, in the biotite and higher zones, grains range from 0.04 to 0.4 mm and have angular boundaries in an equigranular granoblastic fabric (Dorr and Barbosa, 1963, p. 19). Northeast of the Itabira district, even higher metamorphism has resulted in a coarse-grained gneissic itabirite. In all these occurrences, quartz is coarser grained than either hematite or magnetite, which may be a reflection of its greater ease of recrystallization under metamorphic conditions.

CARBONATES
Carbonate minerals are widespread in the area. They comprise the bulk of some beds in the Gandarela (Dorr, 1958) and Fecho do Funil Formations (Sim-

mons, 1958) and are also widely distributed in the Caue Itabirite (Dorr, 1958) and the Nova Lima Group (Dorr and others, 195T). They are accessory minerals in arkose and graywacke of many formations, in schists and phyllites, and in metamorphosed mafic rocks.
No special metamorphic significance is attached to the carbonate minerals. They persist at all rock temperatures under moderate or high confining pressures that prevent the escape of CO2. In coexisting calcite and dolomite, the amount of dolomite in solid solution in calcite is temperature dependent, increasing with increases in temperature. (See section on "Metamorphic Temperatures.")
The only obvious effect of progressive metamorphism in calcitic rocks of the Quadrilatero Ferrifero is an increase in grain size. Amphiboles formed in carbonate rocks of sufficient original clayey and siliceous material, presumably at low or moderate temperatures, and with P >Pn so that CO2 could diffuse from
the environment and allow reactions such as calcite+ magnetite + quartz + water = actinolite + hematite + CO2. In the development of most, if not all, amphibolites from "dirty" carbonate rocks, however, some carbonate persisted even at pressure/temperature conditions that permitted the development of pyroxene (table IT). Clay minerals generally reacted to form mica, but the carbonate minerals apparently did not entirely react with the silicates.
OPTICAL DETERMINATION
Calcite and dolomite were identified, where possible, on a flat stage in thin section using optical criteria (Deer and others, 1962c, p. 243). Ankerite is the assumed carbonate if grains are stained by iron hydroxides.
Gair (1962, table 3) determined by immersion methods the carbonate minerals in 61 samples from the Rio das Velhas Series of the Nova Lima and Rio Acima quadrangles. These samples were divided as follows:
1. Siderite, 24 samples, only in banded iron-formation.
2. Dolomite, variety magnesiodolomite, 18 samples, in the quartz-carbonate rock "lapa seca" (barren rock), with accessory sericite, chlorite, and feldspar; in sericitic or fuchsitic phyllite; in dolomite.
3. Ankerite, varieties ankerite-ferrodolomite, and ferrodolomite, 14 samples, largely in quartzose or banded iron-formation but some in lapa seca or other carbonate rock, with accessory chlorite and sericite.

4. Calcite and calcite magnesiodolomite, five samples, in graywacke, fuchsitic schist, and quartzose and banded iron-formations.
X-RAY DETERMINATION
Thirteen samples were selected for x-ray diffractometer study and were run initially at 1° 26 per minute in the region of about 25° to 34° 26 (table 10). Three of the samples had both calcite and dolomite and were rerun at 1/8° 26 per minute in the region of about 28.8° to 31.5° 26 to determine the precise peaks.
MINERALS AND ASSEMBLAGES
The types of rock that contain significant amounts of carbonate minerals are dolomite, dolomitic ironformation, ferruginous quartzite, phyllite, and schist (table 10). Calcite or dolomite commonly are associated with quartz and in places also with hematite, magnetite, tremolite-actinolite, phlogopite-biotite, muscovite, chlorite, epidote, and graphite. Phlogopitebiotite is best developed in rocks of the Nova Lima, Itabira, and Piracicaba Groups that also have some magnetite (fig. 11).

Carbonates form minor secondary minerals in graywacke, schist, metavolcanic rock, gneiss, and amphibolite throughout the area. In such rocks they are commonly associated with quartz, plagioclase, hornblende, chlorite, biotite, muscovite, epidote, potassiumfeldspar, garnet, and vesuvianite.
The retrograde metamorphism of ultramafic rock produced carbonate, talc, and serpentine, and in places also tremolite, magnetite, and pyrite. Soapstone in the Itabira district consists of as much as 25 percent magnesite or its weathering products (Dorr and Barbosa, 1963, p. 34). Most of the magnesite has been weathered away, leaving rhomb-shaped holes, 2 mm to 2 cm in diameter, that are lined by dark-brown iron hydroxide.
Under conditions of temperature higher than chlorite zone or low CO2 pressure, tremolite (fig. 25) or cummingtonite developed in carbonate-bearing, magnetic, hematite-poor iron-formation, as in the Sao Juliao quadrangle (Guild, 1957, p. 15). At the highest grade of metamorphism in the area, carbonate coexisted with diopside, actinolite, specularite, magnetite, and quartz in the Gandarela Formation, Dom Bosco quadrangle (Johnson, 1962, table 4).

WEATHERING
The carbonate minerals decompose very readily at the surface. Rocks consisting originally of almost pure dolomite have generally been altered to a soft brown material, "splash rock" (Guild, 1957, p. 41-43). Contacts between fresh and altered rock are sharp. Analyses show that the splash rock is composed almost entirely of SiO2, A12O3, Fe2O3, and generally has some manganese locally and some phosphorus.
CHLORITOID
Chloritoid is widely distributed in the Quadrilatero Ferrifero. It occurs principally in a wide belt in the Moeda syncline (Herz and Dutra, 1964, table 1), in the lower part of the Cercadinho Formation in the southern part of the Quadrilatero Ferrifero (Johnson, 1962, p. 17, A. L. M. Barbosa, written commun., 1965), and in the Palmital Formation in the central part of the Quadrilatero Ferrifero (fig. 18).

tures higher than those of these metamorphic zones, chloritoid, muscovite, and quartz react to form staurolite, biotite, and water. At pressures between 4,000 and 8.000 bars and temperatures of 545°±20°C, Hoschek (1967, p. 152) found that chloritoid breaks down in a reversable reaction with aluminum-silicate to form staurolite + quartz + water.
In quartzite of the Palmital Formation, stress was of little influence in the crystallization of chloritoid. Chloritoid crystallized late, commonly in radiating groups or aggregates rather than with a preferred orientation, as would be expected of crystals formed under stress (fig. 19), a condition which has been considered necessary by some authors (Deer and others, 1962a, p. 169).

FIGURE 19. Photomicrograph, chloritoid quartzite, Palmital Formation, Z-346, Rio de Pedras quadrangle, plane light. Chloritoid (c) forms rosettes and isolated prismatic grains. Large clusters of medium- and coarse-grained subangular quartz (q) makes up the bulk of the rock. Muscovite (m), stained by limonite is abundant.

FIGURE 18. Photomicrograph, chlorite-sericite-chloritoid schist, basal Piracicaba Group, J-169, Dom Bosco quadrangle, plane light. Chloritoid (c) formed largely parallel to fold axes. Chlorite (cl) adjacent to sheared quartz vein. Most of the rock is sericite, bent muscovite flakes, quartz, plagioclase (not in slide), and magnetite.
Chloritoid occurs in emery, pelitic schists, and impure quartzites. It develops in rocks having a wide range in percentage of SiO2, having high A12O3, and having low CaO (Tilley, 1925). With increasing CaO, epidote develops instead of chloritoid. Chloritoid forms in both the chlorite and biotite-almandine zones of regional metamorphism; at pressures and tempera-

Halferdahl's (1961, p. 99) experimental results also indicate that total pressure has little influence on the formation of chloritoid. Up to about 700°C, higher pressures necessitate higher temperatures for the formation of chloritoid. Thus, the effect of shearing stress is to raise the pressure locally and, if not accompanied by a rise in temperature, to inhibit the crystallization of chloritoid.
OPTICAL DETERMINATION
Chloritoid was generally identified in thin section by its distinctive pleochroic formula in shades of deep greenish black: medium bluish gray/light bluish gray,

C30

REGIONAL GEOLOGY OF THE QUADRILATERO FERRIFERO, MINAS GERAIS, BRAZIL

grayish yellow green/very pale blue, and blue green/ colorless. In some quartzite of the Palmital Formation, magnesium-rich chloritoid is light green and is nonpleochroic.
Chloritoid has generally developed in phyllite and schist of the Cercadinho Formation and impure quartzite of the Maquine Group and Cercadinho Formation. It formed by progressive metamorphism from indeterminate clay minerals at pressure/temperature conditions of the greenschist facies and persisted under higher pressure/temperature conditions, as shown by its presence in some rocks that also developed staurolite. A probable reaction for the development of chloritoid in aluminum-rich rocks (Halferdahl, 1961, p. 123) is montmorillonite + chamosite = chloritoid + quartz + vapor, which takes place in pelitic or lateritic sediments under sedimentary conditions, that is, temperature below about 400° and pressure under about 1,000 bars.
Some authors consider stress to be an important factor in the development of chloritoid. Head (1957, p. 361 362) found that chloritoid occurred largely in special dislocation environments, such as shales compressed between stiff competent bands. Shearing stress was widespread in the area south of the Bagao Complex, and chloritoid developed (fig. 18). Here, regional stress from the south or southeast faulted or thrust metasedimentary rocks against the Bac,ao (granitic) Complex. The development of chloritoid in basal Piracicaba phyllite, however, must have also been due to a sensitive chemical control because elsewhere, as west of the complex, chloritoid developed in similar beds without extreme shearing stress.
Chloritoid in pelitic rocks and ferruginous quartzites has n/2 of about 1.725, which is within the ironrich range shown by Halferdahl (1961, p. 89); that

from the Palmital Quartzite has n/?"- 1.718 (inferred from table 12), which is within the range of magnesium-rich chloritoid, as is the birefringence of about 0.005 (Halferdahl, 1961).
Chloritoid grains vary considerably in size from fine g~rained in rocks in which it is not abundant to about 0.7 mm long in those in which it is an essential mineral. Gair (1962, p. 32) found that chloritoid is especially abundant in the Casa Forte Formation; there it ranged in grain size from less than 0.1 to about 2mm.
X-RAY DETERMINATION
Three chloritoid samples were selected for X-ray (table 11) and chemical (table 12) analysis: two from the Piracicaba Group of the Dom Bosco quadrangle and one from the Palmital Formation of the Bio de Pedras quadrangle. One object of the X-ray study was to determine if the chloritoid polymorph was triclinic or monoclinic. Halferdahl (1961) could find no essential difference in geologic environment, composition, or optical properties in the two polymorphs, although both Niggli, von E. (1960, p. 135) and Vrana (1964, p. 130-132) found that in Alpine environments, the monoclinic form occurs in the higher pressure/temperature of the chloritoid zone.
Halferdahl suggested three reflections for distinguishing the triclinic form within the range of 20,'s studied: 34.71°, 42.69°, and 49.94° which correspond respectively to MZ's of 112-112, 310, and 221-203221-113. The first and last reflections, which are the strongest, were found in all samples; the 42.69° reflection was found only in Z-346A. All samples are clearly triclinic; in fact, none of the reflections used by Halferdahl (p. 82) to distinguish the monoclinic form were found.

CHEMICAL ANALYSES
Heavy liquids and a Frantz magnetic separator were used to separate three chloritoid samples from chloritoid-rich rocks for chemical analyses (table 12). The samples were checked optically for purity and two were found to be ful] of opaque inclusions of an unknown composition (figs. 20, 21) and all had substantial amounts of quartz. The X-ray diffractometer showed only quartz and chloritoid, and yielded no information on the opaque inclusions.
The two samples from the Piracicaba Group are typical iron-rich chloritoids, and the sample from the Palmital Formation is unusually rich in magnesium, which is substantiated by its low index of refraction. The Piracicaba samples apparently have more than the 0.50 percent CaO, suggested as the maximum in pure chloritoid (Halferdahl 1961, p. 53), possibly because of the inclusions.

Whole rock sample Xo. J-341, a chloritoid phyllite from the Piracicaba Group of the Dom Bosco quadrangle, was analyzed (table 21) to see if it falls within the chemical limits set by Tilley (1925) and other authors for chloritoid-bearing rocks. It is a green schist containing about 40 percent quartz, 30 percent sericite and muscovite, 25 percent chloritoid, 5 percent chlorite and minor magnetite, and, except for alumina, falls within the range given by Tilley: SiO2 from 30 to 80 percent, CaO trace to 0.5 percent, and A12O3 from 10 to 16 percent. The chloritoid phyllite from the Dom Bosco quadrangle contains 22.1 percent A12O3 and in this respect is similar to chloritoidkyanite schists from Slovakia, which have 17.41-20.83 percent A12O3 (Vrana, 1964, p. 129).
The unusually high A12O3 is also reflected in a low .Fe2O3/Al2O3 ratio of 0.12. Williamson (1953) found that the most common Fe2O3/Al2O3 ratio containing chloritoid or staurolite is 0.40 and the lowest known value for chloritoid alone is 0.18 from a chloritoidsericite schist in the Alps. Sample J-341 meets the chemical requirements determined by Halferdahl (1961) for chloritoid-bearing rocks, that is, excess A12O3 and more FeO + MnO than either MgO or Fe2 O3 .
ASSEMBLAGES
In phyllites, chloritoid is typically associated with quartz, muscovite, and chlorite and with minor

amounts of limonite, apatite, pyrite, magnetite, ilmenite, and hematite (figs. 20, 21). In one sample from the Dom Bosco quadrangle (J-172-55, S3080, W2540) which has almost 50 percent chloritoid, the only associated minerals are quartz, tourmaline, and hematite. In the Casa de Pedra and Sao Juliao quadrangles and elsewhere, chloritoid was found with quartz, chlorite, and graphite, or quartz, sericite, magnetite, and very small amounts of chlorite. In phyllitic rocks of the Piracicaba Group, the volume of chloritoid ranges from about 30 to 60 percent and, in one sample from the Ouro Preto quadrangle (2,OOON, 1,400W), forms more than 90 percent of the rock.
Where chloritoid occurs in quartzites of the Piracicaba Group (fig. 21) and the Palmital Formation, it is abundant, as much as 30 percent, and commonly is completely replaced by limonite.
In Cercadinho phyllite of the Moeda syncline (K-2, table 13), chloritoid is associated with kyanite, muscovite, and quartz, and, in places, also with pyrophyllite. In impure Itacolomi quartzite near Casa de Pedra (K-4, table 13) chloritoid, is associated in addition, with garnet (almandine) and magnetite (Herz and Dutra, 1964, p. 1304).-Although the pair chloritoidkyanite has been taken to represent high-grade metamorphism elsewhere (Halferdahl, 1961, p. 115), in the Quadrilatero Ferrifero, as in Alpine metamorphics
FIGURE 21. Photomicrograph, chloritoid-quartz rock, Piracicaba Group, J-434b, Dom Bosco quadrangle, plane light. Chloritoid (c) comprises 60 percent of this rock and up to about 75 percent of some adjacent beds. Many grains have preferred orientation and slight bluish pleochroism. Quartz (q) composes about 40 percent of the rock. Magnetite is an accessory mineral.

C33

(Vrana, 1964, p. 135), the pair is found in rocks of the greenschist facies of the chlorite or biotite zones.
In the Nova Lima Group north of Itabirito, chloritoid is associated with quartz, muscovite, biotite, and pyrite in the biotite zone of metamorphism. Chloritoid is found in the Piracicaba Group near Ouro Preto (A. de Barbosa, oral commun., 1960) in rocks of the staurolite zone, where it developed by retrograde metamorphism of high-grade minerals or persisted as a relict low-grade mineral. Typical assemblages in the almandine or staurolite zones near Ouro Preto and Congonhas do Campo contain chloritoid, muscovite, chlorite, staurolite, minor quartz, and, in places, garnet and pyrite.
RETROGRADE METAMORPHISM AND WEATHERING
In many retrograded rocks formerly of high metamorphic grade, chloritoid and the ore minerals have been the last to develop. Chloritoid evidently replaced staurolite, garnet, and other minerals.
Chloritoid is very resistant to weathering in both quartzites and phyllites. In quartzites, it is commonly stained and partly replaced by hydrated iron oxide. Halferdahl (1961, p. 56) found that chloritoid from many parts of the world had similar coatings which could be removed only with hot concentrated solutions of ammonium citrate.
In phyllite of the Cercadinho Formation in the Serra do Itabirito, chloritoid associated with kjTanite has been extensively replaced by a chlorite mineral of positive sign and a median refractive index of 1.622.
KYANITE 1
Kyanite is the only polymorph of Al2SiO5 found in any quantity in the Quadrilatero Ferrifero. It appears in veins and disseminated in phyllites of the Cercadinho Formation, in quartz veins cutting quartzites along the western side of the Serra da Moeda, in the Serra do Caraga, and elsewhere. In the Itabira Group of the Congonhas district it is found in quartz veins cutting iron-formation or manganese-rich rocks. It developed in response to both low- and high-grade metamorphic conditions in rocks having excess A12O3.
In general, pressure/temperature conditions for kyanite, andalusite, and sillimanite are believed to be high pressure and moderate temperature for kyanite, low pressure and low temperature for andalusite, and moderate pressure and high temperature for sillimanite (Turner and Verhoogen, 1960). Experimental work to determine the triple point of the Al2SiO5
1 Much of this section has been taken from Herz and Dutra, 1964.

polymorphs (Clark, 1961; Bell, 1963) suggests that high pressures of about 8 to 10 kilobars, equivalent to a depth of about 30 km is necessary for the stable crystallization of kyanite at temperatures that would obtain under regional metamorphism. Newton (1966), however, found in hydrothermal experiments that kyanite was stable at 3-5 kilobars pressure and temperatures of 450°-550°C, conditions that might prevail during medium-grade metamorphism.
Kyanite is typically developed in aluminum-rich rocks of the almandine-amphibolite zone of regional metamorphism (Turner and Verhoogen, 1960, p. 551) and, once formed, can persist to the highest metamorphic conditions of the eclogite facies. In rocks of the greenschist facies having excess SiO2 and A12O3 and deficient K2O, however, kyanite can also develop in association with quartz-albite-epidote-almandine
(Turner and Verhoogen, 1960, p. 539). In rocks of obviously low metamorphic grade, such
as fine-grained quartz-chlorite phyllite, the occurrence of kyanite may be due to a combination of ideal chemical composition and high pressure. This is suggested by the facts that such rocks are characterized by an unusually high A12O3 content (20.4 percent in sample J-211, table 21, as an example) and contain kyanite in or near the troughs of synclines, as between the Serra da Moeda and the Serra do Itabirito, and in the syncline east of Casa de Pedra (pi. 1).
Kyanite is always one of the last minerals to crystallize and occurs in grain sizes from fine medium in phyllites to very coarse in veins. In some veins, kyanite is as much as 15 cm long, but the largest crystals are commonly bent or broken.
The basal Cercadinho Formation, which has more kyanite than any other rock within the chlorite and biotite zones of metamorphism, may have originated as a saprolite from which most of the alkaline earths and the alkalies, except K2O, were leached out. Kyaiiite formed both in the matrix and in veins cutting this formation, especially in the troughs of synclines, as noted above, where the tectonic overpressure evidently was greatest (Clark, 1961). During a later metamorphic phase, under lower pressures, much of the vein kyanite was formed.
Kyanite is found in higher metamorphic conditions of the almandine and staurolite zones of metamorphism, where such muscovite and nearly all the chlorite broke down and helped form biotite or potassiumfeldspar plus more kyanite.
Because kyanite is so widespread in different metamorphic environments of the Quadrilatero Ferrifero, a special study was made of the chemical, unit-cell, and optical characteristics of selected samples; this

is presented in greater detail in Herz and Dutra (1964). For this report (table 13) 12 samples were selected from low-grade metamorphic environments. Four are from phyllites, four from veins cutting the phyllites, and four from veins cutting quartz-rich rocks.
OPTICAL DETERMINATION
Kyanite was recognized in thin section by its prismatic form, high relief, inclined extinction, and positive elongation. Indices of refraction and other optical data (table 14) were determined for the 12 samples selected for the special study. The indices were determined with immersion liquids having an 0.005 interval and using sodium-light. 2V and ZAC determinations were made with a 4-axis universal stage on grain mounts.

There is no correlation between the optical and the chemical data, nor between the optical data and modes of occurrence. The total variation in the optical data is so small as to fall within the limits of precision of the determinations.
CHEMICAL ANALYSES
Six major elements were determined in four samples (table 15). CaO, MgO, and MnO were also sought in these analyses, but they were found to be below the limit of sensitivity of wet chemical methods.
Part of the high Fe2O3 and minor-element abundance of sample K-2 from a phyllite can be attributed to the platy opaque inclusions in the grains (noted in table 13). In general, the analyses reveal the same element abundance shown by Deer, Howie, and Zussman (1962a;, p. 139) for kyanite elsewhere in the world.

K-6 to K-ll and K-12, table 16). The appearance of biotite or garnet in one group of rocks and chlorite in another may be as much a function of bulk chemical composition as it is of temperature and pressure. Kyanite, for instance, shows a dependence on the original bulk chemical composition and is developed only in rocks with high Si, Al, and Fe2O3. Minor elements, such as Cr, Fe, V, Mg, Zr, K, Ca, Ti, and Na are relatively abundant in both the country rock and the kyanite and may have had some nucleating effect oil the kyanite (compare with table 5, Herz and Dutra, 1964).
Minor elements that are abundant in both country rock and in kyanite disseminated in phyllite are generally less abundant in vein kyanite (table 16), except for magnesium in samples K-l (2,400 ppm) and K-8 (3,300 ppm). The vein kyanite may represent a continuation of the crystallization of the kyanite in the phyllite itself. The kyanite veins thus may be similar to the "recrystallization pegmatites" of Ramberg (1952), as suggested by the fact that the veins are restricted to rocks that contain disseminated kyanite.
ASSEMBLAGES
In the Quadrilatero Ferrifero, kyanite is always associated with quartz (fig. 22) and nearly always

SPECTROGRAPHIC ANALYSIS

Twenty-eight minor elements were sought in each kyanite sample by spectrographic analysis; 10 elements, however, were always below the detection limits (given in parts per million in parenthesis), and so are not reported in table 16: Ag (1), Au (20), Pb (10), La (30), Li (200), Mo (10), Ta (200); Th (200), W (200), andZn (200).
There is little difference in abundance of the minor elements in kyanite in phyllites of the chlorite and biotite zones of metamorphism (compare K-2 and

In the chlorite zone or the lower part of the greenschist facies, assemblages are as follows: (a) quartz-kyanite (b) quartz-muscovite-kyanite (c) quartz-muscovite-kyanite-pyrophyllite (d) quartz-muscovite-kyanite-chlorite- (pyrophyllite) (e) quartz-muscovite-kyanite-chlorite- (chloritoid) -
(pyrophyllite) (f) quartz-muscovite-kyanite-garnet-chloritoid-
(magnetite) Assemblages (a), (b), and (c) are typical of veins; (d), (e), and (f) of phyllite.
At a higher metamorphic grade than the lower greenschist facies, biotite replaces chlorite, or staurolite replaces chloritoid, and garnet or tremolite may also be associated with kyanite, quartz, and muscovite (table 17). Such kyanite assemblages of higher metamorphic grade than the greenschist facies are found in the Cercadinho Formation or the Itacolomi Series of the Itabira, Nova Lima, Casa de Pedra, Bagao, and Sao Bartolomeu quadrangles at about the same horizon as lower grade kyanite-bearing phyllites are found. In the Itabira district, kyanite forms as much as 20 percent of some "granitic gneisses" (Dorr and Barbosa, 1963, p. 40).
RETROGRADE METAMORPHISM AND WEATHERING
Kyanite generally persists during weathering and is even found unaltered in a saprolite derived from phyl-

lite in the Lagoa Santa region. During retrograde metamorphism, kyanite commonly was partly replaced by pyrophyllite (fig. 23). Small flakes of pyrophyllite replace kyanite initially around the edge of crystals and along cleavages; as replacement advances, the kyanite crystals become ragged and the pyrophyllite better crystallized.
ANDALUSITE AND SILLIMANITE
Andalusite and sillimanite are uncommon in the Quadrilatero Ferrifero. One or the other occurs in pelitic rocks near granitic contacts north of the Serra do Curral, bordering the Bagao Complex, in the Itacolomi area, and in possible roof pendants in the Cocais granite.
Elsewhere in the world, andalusite is known from contact metamorphic aureoles (Turner and Yerhoogen, 1960, p. 509 if). It forms under temperature/pressure conditions of the albite-epidote hornfels facies and is stable into the higher temperature pyroxene hornfels facies. Immediately adjacent to granitic contacts, it gives way to sillimanite, which is generally taken to represent the highest temperature conditions of the almandine-amphibolite facies of regional metamorphism (Turner and Yerhoogen, 1960, p. 544 ff). Once sillimanite forms, it is stable into much higher metamorphic conditions.
Other rocks of the area which may have contained andalusite or sillimanite are now completely weathered

to saprolite, so no general conclusions as to mode of occurrence of these minerals can be made.
ANDALUSITE
Andalusite and staurolite formed together just south of the Bagao Complex; both were later replaced by fine-grained micaceous minerals. Andalusite and garnet are associated in the area of Itacolomi; they tended to be replaced during retrograde metamorphism by a mixture of sericite, chlorite, and limonite.
Andalusite in pelitic rocks of the Nova Lima Group in the Macacos quadrangle has been largely replaced by quartz and sericite. Fresh andalusite occurs in veins together with quartz and white mica in the staurolite

zone in the Belo Horizonte quadrangle (Pomerene, 1964, p. 36). The andalusite crystals which weather out of the rock are as large as 4 by 7 cm and evidently are associated with now-weathered feldspar and co-
rundum veins. Andalusite, pleochroic green-yellow and thus pos-
sibly manganese-rich (Deer and others, 1962a, p. 133), developed in schist near a diabase dike 5 km northwest of Cocais (Simmons, 1968b). The complete assemblage includes andalusite-biotite-muscovite-chloriteciuartz-ilmenite-leucoxene. Field relations are not clear, but Simmons, (1968b) believes that this assemblage iormed in an inclusion or roof pendant in the Cocais
gneiss.

The development of staurolite in this area appears to be controlled both by special chemical composition and metamorphic environment. It is abundant in the Sabara Formation north of the Serra do Curral, near the contact of a granitic intrusion. Along the southern and western margin of the Bagao Complex, staurolite
is commonly found in pelitic schist of the Nova Lima Group near a contact with granite. Staurolite also occurs in the Nova Lima Group in the Brumadinho quadrangle; in the northeastern part of the Quadrilatero Ferrifero in the Piracicaba Group in the Itabira and Monlevade quadrangles; and in the Itacolomi Series and Piracicaba Group in the southeastern part of the Quadrilatero Ferrifero.
The development of staurolite from chloritoid under progressive metamorphic conditions has been discussed in the section on chloritoid.
Staurolite is taken to represent the lowest pressure/ temperature conditions of the almandine-amphibolite facies and the higher grade part of the almandine zone of regional metamorphism; it is developed typically in pelitic assemblages (Fyfe and others, 1958, p. 229). With higher pressure/temperature conditions than those of the almandine zone or the lower part of the almandine-amphibolite facies, staurolite breaks down to quartz and kyanite or to sillimanite

Large amounts of garnet, chlorite (derived retrogressively from biotite, staurolite, or garnet), and tourmaline, and relatively small amounts of sodium-plagioclase and magnetite, occur in staurolite schist of the Sahara Formation north of the Serra do Curral (Gair, 1962, p. 41).
Staurolite commonly has been replaced by chlorite, muscovite, and quartz, and in some of the same rocks biotite is also replaced by chlorite. Chlorite in many rocks, however, does not appear to have developed either from staurolite or biotite. (See section on "Chlorite.") Staurolite in places has been replaced by chloritoid in rocks also containing quartz, muscovite, and chlorite. In general, however, the relations between staurolite and chloritoid are not clear.
Staurolite is present in heavy mineral concentrates from saprolite (R. E. Wallace, oral commun., 1960), and staurolite schist of the Sahara formation has been mapped on the basis of coarse grain size and distinctive crystal form preserved in saprolite.
AMPHIBOLE
Amphiboles are widely developed in the area. Actinolite-tremolite occurs in carbonate rocks and in dolomitic iron-formation of low metamorphic grade (fig. 25). At higher metamorphic grades, the grunerite-cummingtonite-kupferite series formed in dolo-

mitic iron-formation, especially in the Congonhas area, at Brumadinho, north of the Serra do Curral near Sabara and Santa Luzia, in the Passagem mine, and south of the Bagao Complex. Wherever metamorphism was sufficiently high to allow the formation of an aluminum-rich amphibole, hornblende or actinolitic hornblende developed in probable original argillaceous-rich carbonate rock or mafic igneous rock (fig. 26). Anthophyllite developed in talc- and chloritebearing dolomite east of Sao Juliao (Guild, 1957, p. 16).
Tremolite-actinolite is common in magnesium schists in the lower part of the greenschist facies (Turner and Verhoogen, 1960, p. 534). It persists to the amphibolite facies but becomes rich in aluminum and slightly pleochroic.
Hornblende developed during the almandine-amphibolite facies metamorphism of mafic of calcareous rocks. At higher grades than almandine-amphibolite, hornblende pleochroism changes from shades of greenish-blue to greenish-brown, and presumably becomes richer in aluminum (Deer and others, 1963a, p. 304). Grunerite-cummingtonite is commonly formed in ironrich rocks (fig. 28) and cunimingtonite-kupferite in magnesian-rich rocks of the almandine-amphibolite facies. Minerals of both the hornblende and cumrnmgtonite series are found in the highest grade of metamorphism, the eclogite facies.

OPTICAL DETERMINATION
The amphiboles were classified by their combined optical properties. The calcium-rich amphiboles were distinguished from each other primarily by pleochroism. Tremolite-actinolite was identified by an absence of, or low, pleochroism, comparatively low indices of refraction, and low birefringence. The alpha index for the tremolite-actinolite generally is between 1.62 and 1.63, and the gamma index, between 1.635 and 1.656. Actinolitic hornblende has a pale-green pleochroism and slightly higher indices of refraction, with alpha ranging from 1.62 to 1.64 and gamma, from 1.64 to 1.66. The pleochroism of the hornblende is from shades of yellow-green to blue-green to olivegreen and indices of refraction range from 1.629 to 1.660 for alpha and from 1.656 to 1.690 for gamma. Actinolite of the greenschist metamorphic facies, however, may have a deep bluish-green pleochroism which is indistinguishable from that of hornblende of higher metamorphic grades (Turner and Verhoogen, 1960, p. 534). Such actinolite has a low A12O3 content and is generally distinguished from hornblende only by its association with other minerals of lower metamorphic grade.
Minerals of the cummingtonite series have either pale straw maximum pleochroic absorption or none and indices of refraction are about the same as the indices of hornblende. Many specimens are multiple twinned on (100) and nearly all have a higher birefringence than actinolite.
ASSEMBLAGES
Actinolite is associated with dolomite, or quartz, muscovite, and epidote in carbonate-rich or quartzrich rocks of low metamorphic grade (table 17). Biotite, kyanite, and garnet in association with the above minerals evidently indicate metamorphism at higher temperatures than those represented by the lowest grade assemblages. Higher grade is also indicated by an aluminum-rich actinolite together with andesineoligoclase, quartz, epidote and biotite; muscovite, garnet, and hornblende are also seen in places.
In highly metamorphosed rocks derived from argillaceous dolomite, mafic igneous rock, or carbonate ironformation, tremolite crystallized in equilibrium with hornblende, biotite, quartz, magnetite, and apatite or with diopside, quartz, specular hematite, magnetite, and carbonate. The size of tremolite-actinolite crystals generally increased with increasing degree of metamorphism.
Tremolite-actinolite is relatively uncommon in the

low-metamorphic-grade carbonate rocks of the western part of the area. Tremolite occurs in dolomite and dolomitic itabirite at Fecho do Funil in the Brumadinho quadrangle (Guimaraes, 1951, p. 54) and near Riberao da Colonia in the southern part of the Dom Bosco quadrangle (Johnson, 1962, p. 15). In both places high values of PiH2o relative to Pco2 must have facilitated the development of tremolite, whereas elsewhere a high P,'co2 must have been maintained in pore fluids during metamorphism. Near the edge and within the Bagao Complex, aluminous actinolite and hornblende occur in schists and metamorphosed mafic dikes.
Hornblende is present in amphibolite and in metadiabase dikes throughout the region, in mafic xenoliths (fig. 27), in correlatives of the Itabirito granite (Pomerene, 1964, p. 33), and in metamorphosed carbonate and pelitic rocks. Amphibolite derived from carbonate rock or mafic dike rock is most common near Itabira (Dorr and Barbosa, 1963, p. 35-37) and Monlevade (Reeves, 1966, p. 13, 19) in the eastern part and in the southwestern part of the Quadrilatero Ferrifero. The most simple, but not the most common, assemblage, consists of hornblende, epidote, and quartz, and, in places, chlorite or biotite and other accessory
minerals (table 18). A much more widespread assemblage typical of rocks high in aluminum and alkaline earths consists of hornblende, plagioclase An15_35, quartz, epidote, biotite, chlorite, and almandine-rich garnet or microcline.
Hornblende occurs as discrete prisms in quartzamphibolites and consists of ragged uralitic crystals having pale pleochroism derived from pyroxenes in metamorphosed mafic igneous rocks. The grain size of hornblende appears to have no relationship to degree of metamorphism, although large poikilitic crystals are developed only at the highest degrees.
An unidentified fibrous amphibole occurs in some graywackes of the Nova Lima Group in the Rio Acima quadrangle (Gair, 1962, p. 23) and is attributed to admixtures of volcanic material in the original sediment. Assemblages of hornblende and pyroxene are further discussed under pyroxenes.
The grunerite-cummingtonite-kupferite series is developed in carbonate rock and iron-formation in the amphibolite and higher metamorphic facies. The assemblage in carbonate rocks is cummingtonite or kupferite, dolomite, quartz, and commonly, magnetite
(table 19). In dolomitic iron-formation near granitic intrusives, or in roof pendants or xenoliths of ironformation, grunerite occurs with quartz, magnetite, and garnet or biotite and chlorite. The grunerite iron-

formation is best developed in Itabira and north of the Serra do Curral in the Santa Luzia and Nova Lima quadrangles near the contact with the youngest granite. The kupferite-cummingtonite rock occurs in the Brumadinho and Congonhas areas and near Passagem.

South of the Quadrilatero Ferrifero, in the Lafaiete area, an asbestiform manganoan cummingtonite is developed in a sedimentary silicate-carbonate protore of manganese associated with rhodochrosite, spessartite, rhodonite, graphite, quartz, and other accessory minerals (Dorr and others, 1956, p. 291).

REGIONAL GEOLOGY OF THE QUADRILATERO FERRIFERO, MINAS GERAIS, BRAZIL

RETROGRADE METAMORPHISM AND WEATHERING
During retrograde metamorphism, hornblende is replaced by biotite or chlorite or both, and other amphiboles are replaced largely by chlorite.
The amphiboles are unstable during weathering. In saprolites apparently derived from amphibole-rich rocks, amphiboles have been completely replaced by clay minerals but original structures are commonly preserved.
PYROXENE
Pyroxenes are uncommon in metamorphic rocks of the Quadrilatero Ferrifero. The few occurrences are in contact metamorphosed, mafic or calcareous rock or iron-formation, especially xenoliths. Some pyroxene assemblages occur in apparently anomalous locations away from areas of known igneous activity; some of these occurrences, however, are believed to be related to unexposed intrusive rocks.
Pyroxene, generally diopside, is formed in association with hornblende by the metamorphism of calcareous or mafic rocks at the highest temperatures of the amphibolite facies. In the higher temperature gramilite facies, diopside is associated with hypersthene (Turner and Verhoogen, 1960, p. 548-555).
Diopside occurs in minor amounts in mafic xenoliths

or layers in the granite gneiss north of the Serra do Curral, typically in assemblages consisting of abundant hornblende and sericitized plagioclase, plus minor biotite (fig. 27). The diopside crystals range in size from about 0.2 to 0.4 mm and have sharp contacts with hornblende, but they are embayed by feldspar.
In the Passagem gold mine a pale-green pyroxene, probably acmite-diopside, is associated with cummingtonite, quartz, magnetite, and dolomite in magnetic dolomitic itabirite (fig. 5). There is no apparent reason for a higher grade of metamorphism at Passagem. The pyroxene grains are as much as 1 to 2 mm in length and are concentrated in thin laminae. Alternating laminae rich in magnetite, quartz, carbonate, amphibole, and tourmaline have subhedral grains ranging in size from less than 0.01 to more than 0.2 mm.
North of the Serra do Ouro Branco, diopside and actinolite occur in banded specular hematite and quartz-inagnetite-carbonate iron-formation of the Piracicaba Group. The diopside is pale green, averages about 0.04 mm in diameter and forms aggregates; its iia of 1.690 suggests hedenbergite35. The chemical composition of the iron-formation (sample J-68T-1, table 32, no. 13) could have been derived from dolomitic itabirite that recrystallized under moderate temperatures and resulted in a loss of CO2.
Some highly metamorphosed dolomitic itabirite, as in Santa Luzia, contains layers of compact andradite garnet (fig. 28) but is otherwise identical to the rocks described above.
In mafic igneous rocks and xenoliths that contained pyroxene, pale-green uralitic hornblende and chlorite have formed by retrograde metamorphism, and, under the subtropical weathering conditions, pyroxene has broken down readily to chlorite or clay minerals.

GARNET '

FIGUEE 27. Photomicrograph, mafic xenolith in granite gneiss, 53-P-34A, Belo Horizonte quadrangle, plane light. Hornblende (h) comprises about 50 percent of the xenolith; plagioclase (p) forms about 40 percent and is replaced in part by clinozoisite (c) and sericite (s). Diopside (d) has straight boundaries against hornblende, but frays into plagioclase.

Garnet is widely distributed in rocks of medium and high metamorphic grade. It is abundant in pelitic and metavolcanic rocks of the Sabara Formation along the northern slope of the Serra do Curral; in the Rio das Velhas Series bordering the Bagao Complex and, within it, in roof pendants and xenoliths; in amphibolite, quartzite, and schist in the Ouro Preto area; in the southern part of the Congonhas district; in the Moiilevade and Itabira Districts; and elsewhere in the eastern part of the Quadrilatero Ferrifero.
The pyralspite garnets (pyrope-almaiidiiie-spessartite) plus grossularite are the most important in metamorphic rocks, although grossularite-andradite is well developed in impure calcareous rocks and iron-for-

mation metamorphosed at moderate or high grades (Deer and others, 1962a, p. 86). Spessartite crystallizes in manganese-rich rocks in the lowest part of the greenschist facies (Turner and Verhoogen, 1960, p. 537). In the upper greenschist, the epidote-amphibolite, and the amphibolite facies, the almandine molecule is a significant part of the garnet; in the granulite and eclogite facies, the pyrope molecule becomes an important constituent of garnet. Grossularite is an important constituent in metamorphosed pelitic rocks and mafic igneous rocks. Refractive index generally increases and the unit cell edge shortens in the series from Mn- to Fe- to Mg-rich garnet with increasing metamorphism (Sriramadas, 1957).
OPTICAL DETERMINATION
Indices of refraction and unit cell edges were determined for selected samples of garnet (table 20). The reflections used for the cell-edge calculation were at 20 angles of about 30°-31°, corresponding to (400) ; 34°, corresponding to (420) ; and 38°, corresponding to (422).
The index of refraction and the cell edge allow a determination of garnet composition but, unfortunately, not a unique one. In the absence of chemical data, certain arbitrary assumptions must be made in order to use the determinative curves of Sriramadas (1957). According to a statistical study of chemical analyses by Wright (in Deer and others, 1962a, p. 85) the garnet molecules present in biotite schist and amphibole schist are generally almost only almandine, pyrope, and grossularite, and in contact metamorphosed calcareous rocks, they are andradite and grossularite. It is assumed that the garnets in this study are similar to those of Wright's world-wide sample and therefore, depending on the rock type, only the curves of Sriramandas for those molecules mentioned herein have been used.
ASSEMBLAGES
In rocks of low to moderate metamorphic grade in the Belo Horizonte, Itabirito, and Brumadinho quadrangles, garnet is associated with quartz and muscovite in the Sabara formation and the Nova Lima Group. It is invariably euhedral, poikilitically encloses quartz and opaque minerals, and has a great range in grain size, from 0.05 to about 0.5 mm. Chlorite and magnetite are common accessory minerals; biotite is a less common accessory in rocks containing little or no chlorite. In the upper Piracicaba Group in the Casa da Pedra quadrangle (at N5700, W2100) chlori-

toid, magnetite, pyrite, and zircon form another accessory assemblage.
In rocks of the lowest metamorphic grade, garnet, probably spessartite, associated with quartz, chlorite, sericite, and limonite is now represented only by its manganiferous weathering products. In places, spessarite evidently made up a large part of the rock, as in Piracicaba phyllite of the Jeceaba quadrangle
(Guild, 1957, p. 19), where it composed 25 percent. In greenschist of the Rio das Velhas Series in the Congonhas quadrangle, Guild reports that spessartite intercalated with quartz composes about 60 percent of the rock. Quartz and pale amphibole are present in the garnet-rich layers.
Dorr and Barbosa (1963, p. 53) identified spessartite in rocks of the Piracicaba Group in the Itabira quadrangle but considered it hydrothermal in origin, related to nearby manganese deposits. According to Miyashiro (1953), manganese-rich garnet is typical of a low-pressure metamorphism, which is consistent with
a hydrothermal origin and also explains why spessartite garnet, in general, is rare in the Quadrilatero Ferrifero. High-pressure minerals such as kyanite, on the other hand, are common.
Because of the relatively high pressure/temperature conditions that obtained within the contact aureole of the Bagao Complex in the Itabirito, Dom Bosco, and Cachoeira do Campo quadrangles, euhedral garnet developed in association with biotite, quartz, and chlorite in pelitic rocks (fig. 6). Five garnets from pelitic rocks of the Bagao Complex are within the compositional range, pyr23_3o, alm55_66, gro5_19. The size of garnet averages about 0.5 mm in such rocks, but may
be as large as 1 mm or more. In some rocks, chlorite is the same grain size as biotite and appears to have developed at about the same time. In others, chlorite is finer grained than biotite and forms kelyphitic rims around garnet. Other possible mineral assemblages with garnet-biotite-chlorite include andesine-oligoclase, microcline, magnetite, tourmaline, carbonate, sulfides, apatite, ilmenite and zircon. In some chlorite-free rocks, garnet, biotite, and quartz are associated with plagioclase, about An70.
These mineral associations are typical of the almandine zone of regional metamorphism and the garnet in such rocks should be almandine-rich (Turner and Verhoogen, 1960, p. 533). Almandine-rich garnets, alm55_57 , were found in samples of pre-Minas rock R 16-54 (table 20), in the Bagao quadrangle and in J-45-55 and J-750 of the Cachoeira do Campo quadrangle (table 20).

Minas rocks of probable mafic-volcanic origin were metamorphosed in the lower part of the almandine zone; these rocks also form roof pendants in the complex. A garnet from amphibolite in this area has the composition pyri2al62gro26 . Garnet in these rocks ranges in size from fine grained to 15 mm, and is associated with quartz, colorless tremolite-actinolite or cummingtonite, biotite, and in places chlorite, muscovite, epi-
dote, oligoclase-andesine, magnetite, pyrite, and carbonate. In the Itabira quadrangle (Dorr and Barbosa, 1963, p. 15), chlorite schist of possible metavolcanic origin in the Rio das Velhas Series contains prismatic garnets as much as 15 mm in length.
Garnet is associated with quartz, actinolitic hornblende, and almost invariably with andesine or calcic oligoclase, An22_5o (as in J-399, Dom Bosco quad-
rangle, table 20) in mafic volcanic rocks metamorphosed at the highest pressure/temperature conditions of the almandine-amphibolite facies. Accessory min-
erals include epidote, magnetite, carbonate, biotite, apatite, chlorite, and pyrite, The garnet has about the same range in index of refraction and grain size as in the lower grade tremolitic rocks. Such garnet-bearing
CIJ O &
amphibolites also occur in the Nova Lima quadrangle (Gair, 1962, p. 42) and in the Monvelade area (Reeves, 1966, p. 13).
At the same level of metamorphism the upper part of the almandine-amphibolite facies in pelitic rocks, garnet is associated with staurolite, or rarely with
kyanite, as south and west of the Bagao Complex (R124-54,' table 20) and north of Sabara (JG86-56,
table 20). The garnet-staurolite assemblage also includes biotite, quartz, muscovite, and in places chlorite, andesine, magnetite, apatite, and ilmenite (fig. 30).

The grain size of garnet is generally coarse, as much as 7mm.
A sillimanite-garnet-cordierite-biotite-quartz-muscovite assemblage occurs in the contact zone of the Bagao Complex, in the southern part of the Bagao quadrangle (51-G154, table 20). Kyanite-garnet with quartz and muscovite is found in schist and quartzite in contact metamorphic aureoles in the Itabira District (Dorr and Barbosa, 1963, p. 53) and around the Bagao Complex (Bagao quadrangle, N420, E5790).
Pure andradite garnet, grunerite, and diopside crystallized in iron-formation that was engulfed by granite in the Itabira, Santa Luzia, and Nova Lima quadrangles (H 24n, table 20). In the occurrence in the Santa Luzia quadrangle, garnet forms massive layered aggregates, 0.1 to 0.5 mm in width, that generally enclose a thinner layer of magnetite (fig. 28).
In the Itabira quadrangle, andradite occurs in banded quartz-magnetite-grunerite-epidote-muscoviteiron-formation with no associated pyroxene. Much of this garnet is in discrete euhedral grains averaging 0.06 to 0.15 mm.
RETROGRADE METAMORPHISM AND WEATHERING
Garnet commonly retrogresses to chlorite, but in many rocks kelyphitic borders of chlorite preserved garnet grains from further retrograde effects (fig. 6).
Garnet is rarely fresh in outcrops, and typically is replaced by hydrous oxides of iron or manganese. The field identification of spessartite-rich garnet was almost always based on the presence of manganese decomposition products pseudomorphous after dodecahedral garnet. Most decomposed garnet, however, has been replaced by hydrous iron oxides, suggesting a high proportion of original almandine molecule.

Layers of almost pure andradite garnet (a), quartz (q), specularite (s), and magnetite (opaque, m) occur. Grunerite (g) and diopside (d) appear between the other minerals.
EPIDOTE
Epidote minerals, including zoisite and clinozoisite, are common in both the greenschist and the amphibolite facies of regional metamorphism. Epidote is a common minor constituent of "dirty" carbonate rocks, carbonate iron-formation biotite- and plagioclase-bearing phyllite and graywacke. At low metamorphic temperatures, it forms in lime-rich rocks instead of anorthite if Fe3+/Al is sufficiently high (Kamberg, 1952, p. 51) Plagioclase cannot take up more than 0.5-1.0 percent of Fe2O3 whereas epidote can have over 20 percent. This figure suggests that more Fe3+ than Al may actually be found in octahedral sites in the lattice of some epidotes (Deer and others, 1962a, p. 199).
Epidote can form by prograde reaction in the greenschist facies, the upper limit of which has been defined (Ramberg, 1952, p. 140) by the reaction, calcite + chlorite + quartz = actinolite + epidote + H2O + CO2. Epidote commonly also forms by the retrogressive metamorphism of an anorthite-rich plagioclase in an excess of water anorthite+ H2O = epidote + silica + alumina. Epidote then is a diagnostic mineral in both the greenschist facies, in the assemblage quartzalbite-epidote (Turner and Verhoogen, 1960, p. 533), and epidote-amphibolite facies. In the Quadrilatero

Ferrifero, epidote formed both in prograde and retrograde reactions in rocks of the correct chemical composition, presumably with a high Fe3+/Al ratio and abundant Ca and in a favorable physical environment.
Epidote in metamorphosed mafic rocks and quartzrich sediments has a generally low index of refraction and birefringence and no pleochroism, all of which suggest a high percentage of the calcium aluminum molecule (clinozoisite). The alpha index in such epidote generally ranges from about 1.710 to 1.715. In metamorphosed carbonate iron-formation and amphi-
bolite, the epidote is pleochroic, from pale yellow to very pale green, and birefringence and the alpha index are generally much higher, the alpha index averaging about 1.725 to 1.730. The alpha index suggests a composition of about 20 percent or more of pistacite, the Fe-rich component (Winchell and Winchell, 1951, p. 449). The pleochroism also indicates richness in iron.
The epidote minerals are widely developed in chlorite-quartz greenstones and phyllites of low metamorphic grade, carbonate-rocks, carbonate iron-formation, and all rocks containing albite. In metamorphosed mafic and ultramafic rocks, epidote is associated with plagioclase or chlorite. These associations have been described in some detail in the sections of chlorite, carbonates, and feldspar. Epidote comprises as much as 20 percent of greenschist of the Nova Lima Group in the Dom Bosco and Casa de Pedra quadrangles (Guild, 1957, p. 20-22) ; other major constituents are chlorite and
quartz, and, in places, muscovite, magnetite, hematite, and sphene are common accessories. These rocks invariably contain layers alternately rich in quartz and chlorite. Fine-grained aggregates or discrete grains of epidote as much as about 0.3 mm in size are largely restricted to the chlorite-rich layers.
In rocks of higher metamorphic grade the almandine-amphibolite facies of Turner and Verhoogen (1960, p. 544) epidote is largely restricted to hornblende-bearing amphibolite (table 18) derived from mafic intrusive rock and to metamorphosed carbonategrunerite iron-formation (table 19).
Epidote forms thin veins, averaging about 0.3 mm in width. In the staurolite zone in the Ibirite quadrangle, the veins cut gneiss and oligoclase biotite schist, but the epidote has no evident reaction relation-
ship with the plagioclase and so may owe its origin solely to calcium metasomatism related to the nearby granitic intrusion.
Allanite commonly grades into epidote in amphibolites of higher metamorphic grade, such as those north of the Bagao Complex, and 1 km east of Caete (B. Alves, oral commun., 1961). The allanite is meta-

mict and isotropic and occupies the central parts of very fine grained granular epidote-appearing aggregates.
Under weathering conditions, epidote minerals readily break down into indeterminate clay minerals.
TOURMALINE
Tourmaline of apparent metasomatic origin is disseminated widely in quartzite and schist or concentrated in veins that border granitic or gneissic rocks. Tourmaline of some quartz-tourmaline veins extends beyond the vein walls into the country rock. Many beds and lenses consisting of nearly pure tourmaline occur in pelites of low and medium metamorphic grade. Tourmaline of probable detrital origin, or derived from boron-rich sediments is also widely disseminated in phyllites and other metasedimentary rocks.
Tourmaline near granite contacts is commonly accepted as evidence of boron metasomatism, especially when the granite itself has been tourmalinized (Turner and Verhoogen, 1960, p. 575). In low-grade pelitic rocks, the evidence for origin is not clear, and Goldschmidt (1954, p. 288) has postulated that tourmaline was derived from a mobilization of chemically precipitated boron that was present in the sediments. Frondel and Collete (1957) synthesized tourmaline under conditions that ranged from 350°C and 2,000 bars to 550°C and 700 bars. This great range in temperature and pressure and the related tendency of tourmaline to persist to the highest grades of metamorphism eliminates it as a metamorphic index mineral.
Tourmaline was identified by pleochroism and indices of refraction (Winchell and Winchell, 1951, p. 465). Grains having a pale-yellow pleochroism and n0 below about 1.65 are called dravite, the magnesiumrich tourmaline; those having pleochroism in shades of brown or green and having n0 above 1.65 are called schorlite, the iron-rich tourmaline. Elbaite, the lithium aluminum-rich tourmaline has about the same indices of refraction as dravite, but has a much weaker pleochroism, colorless pink or pale blue to colorless, which was not seen.
Both dravite and schorlite occur near granitic contacts throughout the Quadrilatero Ferrifero in medium- to coarse-grained prismatic crystals, commonly forming rosettes in veins with quartz and, rarely, sulfide. Schorlite, the most common variety, is intergrown with minor amounts of quartz in pods and lenses in phyllite.
Slender needles of dravite of apparent metasomatic origin occur both disseminated and locally concen-

trated in the basal quartzite of the Moeda Formation of the Jeceaba and Casa de Pedra quadrangles (Guild, 1957, p. 12). The disseminated grains are slightly pleochroic in shades of yellow and Ne = 1.620; the concentrated grains are pleochroic yellow to brown or pink to green and Ne = 1.630.
Other tourmaline of possible metasomatic origin is contained in Cercadinho ferruginous quartzite, associated with kyanite and talc, in the Santa Rita Durao quadrangle (C. H. Maxwell, 1972) ; in phyllite of the Xova Lima Group (fig. 29) ; in the Batatal Formation in the Itabira District; and in the Caue Formation and rich hematite ore at Pico de Itabirito (Dorr and Barbosa, 1963).
Tourmaline of probable detrital origin is a common accessory mineral in rocks of the Piracicaba Group in the Dom Bosco quadrangle and is especially abundant in quartz-chloritoid phyllite containing also magnetite, apatite, and sphene (Johnson, 1962, p. 17).
In almost all its occurrences, tourmaline was one of the last minerals to crystallize. Tourmalinite veins in areas where there is no known nearby granite body are attributed to boron-rich hydrothermal fluids. As far as can be determined, metamorphism had no effect on the occurrence of tourmaline. The importance of the type of country rock, however, can be seen at Salto in the Jeceaba quadrangle and in the southern

part of the Bagao Complex where tourmaline veins darken in color and the tourmaline evidently changes composition in passing from granitic rock or quartzite into phyllite (Guild, 1957, p. 12). The composition change must be from magnesium-rich dravite in the quartz-rich or granitic rock to iron-rich schorlite in the phyllite. Similar chemical changes also occur in kyanite (table 16).
Tourmaline is resistant to changes by metamorphism or weathering and has been recovered in heavy mineral residues of gneissic saprolite (Wallace, 1965).
OTHER MINERALS
Vesuvianite. Vesuvianite occurs in minor amount in carbonate-bearing graywacke of the lower part of the Sabara Formation from the Belo Horizonte quadrangle (N1570, E2260). The associated minerals are quartz (about 50 percent), biotite (about 35 percent), and accessory plagioclase (about Ab90 ), carbonate, magnetite, and epidote.
Apatite. Apatite is common in amphibolite and metamorphosed mafic intrusive rock and other rocks that contain amphibole, as well as schists that are rich in muscovite or biotite. It is invariably prismatic, fine grained, and disseminated in the more mafic layers of the rock.
Talc. Talc is found in metamorphosed ultramatic rocks, carbonate rocks, and in and near iron-formation. Fine flakes of talc of probable hydrothermal origin are commonly disseminated in siliceous parts of the Caue Itabirite. In the Itabira district, for example, talc is the only visible "impurity" other than iron hydroxides in a rock made up of specular hematite and granular quartz (Dorr and Barbosa, 1963, p. 19). The talc is flaky green and tan, forms plates as large as 10 mm, and is concentrated largely on surfaces between the dominantly quartzose and the dominantly ferruginous layers. Talc veinlets in quartzite of the overlying Piracicaba Group follow bedding planes and joints and are attributed to the same solutions that were responsible for talc in the itabirite.
Sphene and rutile. Sphene is common in amphibolite and mafic pelitic rock of all metamorphic grades. Grains range widely in size and are largely altered to leucoxene (fig. 1).
Fine needlelike inclusions of rutile occur in biotite and chlorite in gneiss, greenschist, and impure dolomite of the Gandarela Formation, as an accessory mineral in schist, phyllite, and quartzite of the Palmital Formation; and in vein quartz.
Hematite, magnetite, maghemite, and ilmenite. Minor amounts of iron oxide are present in all types

of rock and at all grades of metamorphism. Hematite is the major constituent of much itabirite; magnetite and maghemite are more abundant in carbonate-rich itabirites than in siliceous itabirites. Magnetite appears to be more abundant in rocks containing biotite and hematite in rocks containing chlorite.
Hematite ranges in grain size throughout the area from 0.05 mm in some itabirite to almost 1 m in the Cercadinho Formation in the Itabirito quadrangle (Wallace, 1965, p. 19). It is generally found in tabular plates or irregular grains. Magnetite occurs in euhedral grains, from fine grained in most rocks, to 7 cm
in greenstone in the Cata Altas quadrangle (Maxwell, 1972). In places in itabirite, ragged magnetite grains are partially replaced by hematite (Pomerene, 1964, p. 42, for example).
Ilmenite is generally fine grained and identified in thin section by its leucoxene alteration products. It is a common accessory mineral in amphibolite and pelitic rock of the Nova Lima Group.
Zircon. Zircon is widely distributed in minor amounts. It appears to be most common in amphibolite, but also occurs in schist and quartzite.
Sulfides. Pyrite is disseminated in phyllite, dolomite, amphibolite, and other rocks. Other sulfide minerals are more common in veins in association with carbonates and quartz. In the Nova Lima quadrangle, gold-bearing sulfides are associated with "lapa seca," a rock consisting largely of quartz and dolomite or ankerite (Gair, 1962, p. 56).
Corundum. Blue corundum is associated with deeply weathered feldspar in veins in the Belo Horizoiite quadrangle (Pomerene, 1964, p. 36). Veins of andalusite-muscovite-quartz are associated with those of corundum and feldspar.
Topaz. Topaz is associated with euclase and quartz crystals as large as 20 cm in a belt that parallels the Cercadinho Formation in the Ouro Preto and Dom Bosco quadrangles (Gorceix, 1881; Derby, 1901). It is not known whether the minerals are in pegmatites or directly in phyllite. Pebbles of topaz also occur in
streams near the village of Germane, in the Santa Eita Durao quadrangle in the eastern part of the Quadrilatero Ferrifero (Maxwell, 1972). The pebbles apparently are derived from the Cercadinho Formation and may be related to a large fault zone.
Manganese minerals. Cryptomelane, polianite, psilomelane, pyrolusite, and manganite occur in manganese ores in the Quadrilatero Ferrifero and all are believed to be secondary and to be derived from manganese-rich dolomitic rocks (Dorr and others, 1956).

Cordierite. Highly altered cordierite was identified optically in thin sections of quartz-almandine garnetmuscovite-biotite-sillimanite-cordierite schist from the contact zone south of the Bagao Complex (51-G-154, table 20). According to Fred Barker, U.S. Geological Survey (oral commuii., 1965), the cordierite strongly resembles altered cordierite found elsewhere in thin sections and is similar to that illustrated by Schreyer and Yoder (1961) (fig. 30). Sillimanite is an alteration product of the cordierite and is diagnostic of altered cordierite (Wiiichell and Winchell, 1951, p. 470).
PETROGRAPHY
PELITIC ROCKS
LITHOLOGY
CHLORITE ZONE
By far the most common types of rocks in the Quadrilatero Ferrifero are chloritic phyllite and schist of low metamorphic rank. They occur in all quadrang~les and in almost every^ formation. Fuchsitic schists or graphitic phyllites are locally abundant, as are varieties rich in carbonate minerals, iron oxides, or tourmaline.

Grain sizes range from extremely fine, below the limit of optical resolution, to coarse grained. Where the grain size is medium coarse, muscovite and chlorite are well alined and the rock is strongly foliated. Nova Lima phyllites are largely gray green or green when fresh but weather to pinkish, red, maroon, or buff (Gair, 1962, p. 9). The Batatal Formation phyllite is light or dark gray (Maxwell, 1958, p. 61) and some other phyllites have merely been described as varicolored.
In most rocks of the Minas Series, bedding is apparent, whereas in parts of the pre-Minas it has been destroyed by shearing, retrogressive metamorphism, and phyllonitization (figs. 1 and 3; Wallace, 1965, p. 9). Phyllonitization is indicated by the recrystallization of elongate grains of quartz parallel to foliation planes (Williams and others, 1954, p. 207). Augen-
shaped masses of quartz having serrated boundaries between grains and small folds in micas around the augen are taken as evidence of cataclasis. In rocks of the Minas Series, however, most quartz grains are equant and provide no evidence of cataclastic origin.
The most common mineral assemblage in the phyllitic rocks consists essentially of quartz, chlorite, and muscovite plus accessory iron oxides, tourmaline, carbonate minerals, and graphite. In rocks with a low ratio of K2O: A12O3 chloritoid also is developed (fig. 19).
Most of the pelitic rocks of the Quadrilatero Ferrifero are relatively high in A12O3 and K2O (tables 21, 32), and unusually low in CaO. Low CaO is typical of all Precambrian pelitic rocks, and is explained by the lack of lime-secreting invertebrates which are responsible for fixing lime and CO2.
These pelitic rocks have one of the highest A12O3/ Na2O ratios of any rocks in the world (Herz, 1962, p. 77) which indicates a mature sedimentary source. Sodium is easily leached from soils whereas aluminum generally remains, and neither is likely to be added or subtracted after deposition (Pettijohn, 1957, p.
103). The high A12OS is also accompanied by comparatively low SiO2, which suggests that the original sediment was enriched in clay and impoverished in silt and so was extremely fine grained.
Comparatively few rocks in this area have higher soda and concommitantly lower alumina and potash, which leads to development of albite or oligoclase. Elsewhere in the world, plagioclase-bearing rocks are much more common, suggesting that pelitic rocks of the Quadrilatero Ferrifero were derived from areas undergoing intensive tropical weathering.

and schist occur in the Sahara Formation (Gair, 1962, p. 41), the Nova Lima Group (Dorr and others, 1957, p. 18), and the Moeda quartzite. A volcanic origin for the feldspar-rich beds of the Nova Lima has been proposed (Dorr and others, 1957) on the basis of composition and mineral associations. Simmons (1968b) concluded that a saprolite on the Nova Lima Group in the Barao de Cocais area is a metavolcanic rock because it is rich in relict feldspar laths, has no quartz, and weathers to a dark-brownish-red material. A volcanic origin for these rocks is reasonable considering that soda is generally low in the bulk of the other phyllites of sedimentary origin.
Feldspar porphyroblasts in metasedimentary rocks near granite contacts as in the basal Moeda Formation of the Macacos quadrangle are probably of metasomatic origin. The porphyroblasts are small and generally full of inclusions of quartz. The amount of feldspar decreases markedly within a short distance of the contact, suggesting that feldspar was related to potassium- and sodium-metasomatism controlled by a thermal gradient bordering the granite intrusion (Orville, 1963).
Minor elements in the pelitic rocks (table 22) are present in about the same proportions as they are in metasedimentary rocks the wrorld over (Herz and Dutra, 1960, table 6).

BIOTITE AND HIGHER ZONES
BIOTITE SCHISTS
Biotite schist occurs widely in the Nova Lima Group and in the Sabara Formation, north of the Serra do Curral, and throughout the southern and eastern parts of the region. The appearance of biotite marks increasing temperature conditions over the chlorite zone.
Biotite schist is generally dark colored and has one or more well-developed foliation planes, the principal one being generally parallel to compositional layering. The biotite is generally coarse grained and is either lepidoblastic, forming part of the schistosity, or porphyroblastic. Augen structures are seen in which micas wrap around quartz-feldspar aggregates. The biotite is commonly interleaved with muscovite and chlorite; the three minerals may have grown together, biotite may have replaced chlorite or muscovite or biotite may have been replaced, especially by chlorite. The three minerals, together with quartz and accessory epidote and magnetite, are the most commonly found assemblage (fig. 14). In biotite schist of the Nova Lima Group, the common accessory minerals are carbonates, albite, epidote, graphite, and iron oxides. Elsewhere, assemblages include quartz-oligoclase-muscovite-biotite-epidote plus accessory tourmaline and

GARNET AND STAUROLITE SCHISTS
Garnet-bearing and staurolite-bearing schists of high metamorphic grade are present in the Nova Lima and in the Piracicaba Groups (fig. 31) adjacent to large granitic bodies, for example, around the Bagao Complex; north of the Serra do Curral (Gair, 1962, p. 52); in the Monlevade quadrangle (Keeves, 1966); the Itabira quadrangle (Dorr and Barbosa, 1963, p. 53) ; the Brumadinho quadrangle (Simmons, 1968a, p. 31) in the Congonhas district (Guild, 1957); and in the Ouro Preto district (A. L. M. Barbosa, written commun., 1965).
North of Sabara a typical assemblage consists of quartz, muscovite, biotite, chlorite, and staurolite plus subordinate oligoclase, magnetite, and garnet (Gair, 1962).
These schists are generally dark colored, and their foliation planes are crinkled. Folia consist of alined flakes of mica and chlorite separated by quartz seams. Some samples have a micro-augen structure, in which blades of mica wrap around quartz grains or aggregates. Porphyroblasts consists of sieve-structured staurolite and garnet and of biotite. Most garnet is partially or completely replaced by iron oxides, and most staurolite, by silica, clay minerals, or sericite.
Sample A-4953 (table 21) is a typical garnet staurolite schist from north of Sabara. It is chemically similar to low-metamorphic-grade pelitic rocks except

that it has somewhat higher sodium, which allowed plagioclase to crystallize. Minor elements in both the schist and the low-grade rocks (table 22) are of about the same order of magnitude, suggesting that metasomatism did not significantly change the chemical composition of the rocks. If this is so, then the higher sodium in the schist, which is still within the values given for common shales (Pettijohn, 1957, p. 344), may be fortuitous.
BIOTITE GNEISS
Pre-Minas biotite gneiss grades into, or is closely associated with, amphibolite, feldspathic gneiss, and biotite schist and has generally been mapped as "granitic" rock. Biotite gneiss in the Piracicaba Group, on the other hand, is not gradational into other types of rock and so is easily differentiated in the field. In the Itabira district, pre-Minas gneiss has been described as a specific petrographic type in a "granitic gneiss" complex but was not separated in mapping (Dorr and Barbosa, 1963). In the Monlevade district especially, gneiss poor in potassium-feldspar corresponds stratigraphically to beds of the Piracicaba Group and has been named the Bicas Gneiss (Beeves, 1966).

METAMORPHIC ROCKS

C51

The Bicas Gneiss of the Monlevade district is light gray, granoblastic with fine- to medium-grained crystals, and has a granular texture. Biotite flakes comprise a strong planar orientation and elongation of quartz grains forms a weak lineation. A typical specimen (as Ha-37, table 27) is about half quartz and a quarter biotite; other minerals are plagioclase, about An30, epidote, garnet, apatite, and zircon.
Eocks interbedcled with biotite gneiss in the Monlevade and Itabira Districts contain magnetite and abundant coarse muscovite, which commonly lies at an angle to the foliation plane (as Ha-39, table 27). Variations in the relative proportions of minerals, and the addition in places of chlorite and potassium-feldspar, give rise to other types of gneiss.
Biotite gneiss and quartz-rich schist in the Nova Lima Group and Sabara Formation in the northwestern part of the Quadrilatero Ferrifero is medium grained, with or without strong foliation shown by micas (Gair, 1962, Pomerene, 1964). Quartz is slightly elongated and forms granoblastic mosaics and angular grains. These rocks grade into granitic gneiss and quartzite.
Two samples of biotite gneiss from the Monlevade District (Ha-37, 39, table 27) are similar except for the presence of coarse muscovite and correspondingly high K2 O in sample 39 and a lack of muscovite in sample 37. These gneisses are far richer in minor elements that have more of an affinity with late-stage phases of granitic intrusion, such as La, Nb, Sn, and Be, than are the other high-grade metamorphic rocks (table 28). The gneisses contain about the same amount of the basic elements, Co, Cr, Ni, V, and Zr, as the average pelitic rock.
Gneisses that are closely associated with granitic rocks are discussed in the report on igneous and gneissic rocks.
METAMORPHISM
Compared to others elsewhere, the pelitic rocks of this area have about average amounts of SiO2, total iron, MgO, TiO2, P2O5, MnO, and H2O (table 23); somewhat above average amounts of A12O3 and K2O; and far below average amounts of CaO, Na2O, and CO2.
Assuming that the regional metamorphism led only to a loss of water and CO2 and no significant changes in gross chemical composition, the regional average of 20.1 percent A12O3, which contrasts with about 15-17 percent A12O3 in average shale (Pettijohn, 1957, p. 365), suggests that an unusually large amount of residual clay was mixed with the original sediment.

The average pelitic rock of the Quadrilatero Ferrifero . is also similar to typical residual clay (of analysis 4, table 23) in having a high oxidation ratio (Chinner, 1960, p. 187) (54.5 and 59.5, respectively) and abnormally low CaO and Na2O. These data suggest that the source of material for the pelitic rocks was deeply weathered residual oxidized and leeched soil low in alkalies and high in bauxite. The A12O3/ Na2O ratio of 57 is intermediate between Nanz' (1953) ratio of 125 for pelitic rocks associated with oHhoquartzites and 11 for pelites associated with immature sediments, such as graywackes, and is a further indication of a mature provenance for the rocks of the Quadrilatero Ferrifero.
Shales having more than 5 percent of K2O constitute only about 5 percent of all shales (Pettijohn, 1957, p. 369). The average pelitic rock in the Q nadrilatero Ferrifero has 4.5 percent K2O; three samples contain more than 5 percent K2O (table 21), as well as low CaO and Na2O, in common with other highpotassium shales. A high potassium content in politic rocks is generally attributed to a reaction between clay minerals and sea water (Pettijohn, 1957, p. 370) so that, although all alkalies may have been lea.ched during the preclepositioiial weathering, potassium and magnesium can be restored on the ocean floor. Calcium, on the other hand, is normally regained in post-Precambrian sediments by addition from organic precipitation; the low value for CaO in the rocks of the Quadrilatero Ferrifero, as well as in the Precambrian rocks of Nanz1, study, is attributed to the lack of biochemical processes in ancient seas.

mally restored on the sea bottom and so is very low in shales derived from maturely weathered sediments.
The dark-green and gray colors of these sediments suggest that they were deposited in a reducing environment (Pettijohn, 1957, p. 359). In such an environment, plus alkaline conditions, kaolinite would be unstable and other clay minerals such as illite and chlorite would form (Grim, 1953, p. 356). Presumably, the chief constituents of the detrital-silt fraction were bauxitic minerals accompanied by some quartz.
Authigenic changes and compaction may have produced illite and chlorite, hydrated aluminum oxide, quartz, and some iron oxides. Aluminum hydroxides were converted into clay micas and kaolinite on the sea bottom. Noll (1936) found that a combination of alkaline conditions, and a molecular ratio K2O/ AloOs, of 0.2 to 0.37 was needed for such a clay-mica reaction. The pelitic rocks of the Quadrilatero Ferrifero have a K2O/A12O3 ratio of 0.24, and, from such indications as the oxidation ratio, formed in a reducing environment. It would not have been unusual for some kaolin to have formed under these conditions, as it does in many marine sediments (Grim, 1953, p. 355). Kaolinite develops by reaction between aluminum hydroxides, such as boehmite and silica at temperatures as low as 250°C and pressures of 41 atmospheres in sediments having a molecular ratio of SiO2/Al2O3 of over 4:1 (Noll, 1936).

In places, especially in rocks of high metamorphic grade from thermal aureoles around granitic intrusions, a high K2 O content may be due to potassiummetasomatism (Orville, 1963). The coarse muscovite of the Itacolomi quartzite (A. L. M. Barbosa, written commun., 1965) and the feldspar porphyroblasts in the basal Moeda Formation of the Ibirite quadrangle for instance are attributed to metasomatism. In these rocks, microscopic evidence has shown that potassiumrich minerals formed at the expense of nonpotassic minerals. In the average potassium-rich pelite of low metamorphic grade in the Quadrilatero Ferrifero, on the other hand, there is no such microscopic evidence of substitution, as for example, of muscovite for chlorite. The amount of K2 O furthermore, apparently is not related to either geographic position, or to structural position, making it unlikely that granite intrusions were necessarily a source of potassium-rich solutions. It should be noted that Precambrian pelitic rocks the world over have, in general, a higher K2O content than do younger pelites (Nanz, 1953).
LOW-GRADE METAMORPHISM
Equilibrium mineral assemblages for rocks of different chemical composition in the greenschist facies can be shown in an AKF diagram (figs. 32, 33).
The most abundant minerals are quartz, sericite (muscovite), and chlorite, which places these rocks in the quartz-muscovite-chlorite albite subfacies of the greenschist facies (Turner and Verhoogen, 1960, p. 536). By chemical composition the rocks are within the nuiscovite-chloritoid-chlorite field of the AKF diagram. They have an average K2O content of 4.8 percent; with lower K2O, for example, 3.2 percent in J-341 (table 21), the rocks also contain chloritoid.
Many pelitic rocks that are richer in A12O3 and lower in K2O than the average pelite of the region also contain kyanite, which is shown at the A apex of both AKF diagrams; these rocks plot in the uppermost part of the AKF diagram.
The microcline-muscovite field of the AKF diagram is not known in the area. Although the politic rocks are rich in K2O, considering the world average (table 23) they are alkali-deficient relative to A12O3. Consequently, the formation of potassium-feldspar and albite were inhibited whereas the growth of muscovite was promoted.
At temperatures of about 200° or 300°C (see p. 71) to 400°C and pressures of 2,000 bars or higher, depending on the tectonic overpressure in local structures, chlorite and muscovite crystallized from the clay minerals. Epinormative minerals for pelites of low

metamorphic grade that contain no chloritoid or carbon (Barth, 1959) were calculated from the chemical analyses (table 24) and these are identical to the modal minerals, suggesting that chemical equilibrium was attained during metamorphism. The epinorm has 42.6 percent quartz, 42.0 percent muscovite, 14.3 percent chlorite, and 1.1 percent accessories. For the calculations it was assumed that all K2O was in muscovite and all Na2O in paragonite as muscovite solid solution. (See p. 71.)
Of the chlorite-muscovite-quartz phyllites described chloritoid also formed in those containing less than about 4 percent K2 O and excess A12O3 and relatively low CaO. Halferdahl (1961, p. 123) found that chloritoid formed from a mixture of clay minerals such as kaolinite, gibbsite, and chamosite and then remained stable at elevated pressures (above about 7,000 bars) to temperatures of 700°C.
There are certain similarities in chemical analyses of chloritoid-bearing rocks (all molecular ratios) : (a) Al2O3/Fe2O3 + FeO + Mgo + MnO ratios are greater than one; (b) both numerator and denominator of (a) are greater than the sum of K2O + Na2O + CaO; (c) there is excess A12O3 after figuring muscovite and chlorite in the norm; (d) FeO4-MnO are greater than MgO, and (e) FeO4-MnO are greater than Fe2O3 (Halferdahl, 1961, p. 109-111). All these conditions are met for sample No. J-341 (Herz, 1962, p. 76), so it can be assumed that the appearance of chloritoid in that rock is also a function of its chemical composition.
The chloritoid-bearing and the muscovite-chloritequartz phyllites must have had a similar provenance because the two types of rock are interbedded and gradational both vertically and laterally.
A manganese-rich variety of garnet may have been abundant in some rocks of the lowest greenschist facies but, unfortunately, is represented today only by manganese oxide weathering products and a general dodecahedral form. Although restricted in occurrence, it is locally abundant and formed large crystals.

MEDIUM-GRADE METAMORPHISM
Most of the minerals formed in alumino-potassic phyllites under greenschist conditions are stable at higher temperatures, especially if high temperatures are accompanied by very high load pressure. Sericite recrystallizes as coarse flakes of muscovite and chlorite tends to become coarser. Biotite may replace sericite or chlorite in a reaction which apparently involves a change from an Fe-rich chlorite to one rich in Al and Mg, at the expense of muscovite and quartz.
The crystallization of biotite must have taken place within a narrow pressure/temperature range in rocks that had sufficient K (of the AKF diagram) but had more F and less A than the more aluminous rocks in which chloritoid or kyanite crystallized. Osb?-rg (1952, p. 104) found that biotite also appeared in Vermont in greenschist of low metamorphic grade that is relatively rich in F and poor in A.
No analyses plot below the muscovite-chlorite join in the AKF diagram representing low-grade metamorphic rocks (fig. 32) and, similarly, none of them have biotite. Biotite-bearing rocks such as H-39 fall near the muscovite-biotite join, in the A deficient field in the AKF diagram representing high-grade metamorpliism (fig. 33). Although biotite occurs in some rocks that are in the chlorite zone and that contain plagioclase of composition An0_i0 it is much more common in rocks that have been metamorphosed above the chlorite isograd and that contain plagioclase with an anorthite content of more than 10 percent.
Biotite-bearing pelitic rocks in the Quadrilatero Ferrifero are characterized by assemblages of biotitemuscovite-quartz and belong to the quartz-albite-epidote-biotite subfacies of the greenschist facies (Turner and Verhoogen, 1960, p. 537). Apparently the great excess of Al over alkalies and Ca in the Quadrilatero Ferrifero inhibited the crystallization of both feldspar and epidote, which are common in pelitic rocks elsewhere.

In some rocks, almandine appears with biotite which has been taken by some to indicate the greenschist, and by others, the amphibolite facies (Turner and Verhoogen, 1960). Most garnet in this area, however, is also associated with staurolite, hornblende, or oligoclase-andesine, and sillimanite near Engeiiheiro Correa, as well as with biotite, and so formed in the amphibolite facies. In only a few specimens where albite is also found can garnet be considered to represent the quartz-albite-almandiiie subfacies of the greenschist facies. Almandine is typically associated with amphibole in metamorphosed mafic dikes and with staurolite and biotite in pelitic rocks in the Quadrilatero Ferrifero. In the western part of the Quadrilatero Ferrifero, garnet associated with biotite is a very high-almandine variety having a restricted range in composition of almandiiie56_66 pyrope23_3o grossularite6_25 (table 20).
HIGH-GRADE METAMORPHISM
The most important differences between pelitic rocks of low and high nietamorphic grades are the presence of staurolite instead of chloritoid and almandine garnet instead of chlorite and spessartite garnet (figs. 32, 33). Biotite is coarser and more abundant than in rocks of lower nietamorphic grades. A typical suite

from the innermost nietamorphic aureole of the Sabara Formation adjacent to the granite contact, north of Sabara (analysis A-4953, table 21) contains staurolite, biotite partly altered to chlorite, garnet, muscovite, quartz, and magnetite. The staurolite-bearing schist is chemically quite similar to the lower-grade chloritemuscovite-quartz (-chloritoid) phyllite, but. may have more CaO and Na2O and less K2O. The schist, however, has less CaO and about the same amount of K2O as Clark's average shale and is similar to Nanz' average Precambrian slate (table 23, column 2 and 3, respectively).
The breakdown of chloritoid may have taken place in this area by two reactions (Halferdahl, 1961, p. 123): Chloritoid + kyanite = staurolite + quartz + vapor
Chloritoid + quartz = almandine + staurolite + vapor
Experimentally these reactions take place at temperatures below about 675 °C and at pressures of about 9 kilobars. Staurolite, however, probably also formed at the expense of chlorite in much the same way that garnet did, with chlor^e becoming richer in Mg and Al and poorer in Fe.
Mineral assemblages formed by high-grade metamorphism of pelitic rocks here are typical of the staurolite-alniandine snbfacies of the almandine-amphibolite facies of Turner and Verhoogen (1960, p. 545). Compared with such rocks of high metamorphic grade elsewhere in the world, the high-gr?,de pelitic rocks in the Quadrilatero Ferrifero have little plagioclase. The assemblage, quartz-staiirolite-almandinemuscovite-biotite, is most typical of such rocks in the Quadrilatero Ferrifero, whereas elsewhere oligoclaseandesine is common and biotite may be missing. Again, as in the low-grade nietamorphic facies, this is best explained by the abundance of the chemical components of A and F, and the relatively small amount of K in the Brazilian pelitic rocks (fig. 33). A diagrammatic representation of the changes during progressive metamorphism is shown in figure 34. Areas enclosed by each mineral are approximately proportional to volume present in assemblages.
CARBONATE-RICH ROCKS
Carbonate minerals occur widely in the Quadrilatero Ferrifero especially in the Gandarela Formation of the Itabira Group (Dorr, 1958, p. 63), in part of the Fecho do Funil Formation of the Piracicaba Group (Simmons, 1958, p. 65), in lenses and as carbonaterich iron-formation in the Caue Itabirite and the Nova Lima Group.

area are dolomite or calcitic dolomite (following Pettijohn, 1957, p. 418).
The carbonate rocks of the Minas Series have generally much less accessory minerals than those of the Rio das Velhas Series. In addition, they are thicker, mappable units rather than gradational or lensatic as in the Eio das Velhas. This contrast suggests that organic processes may have become more effective by about 2,300 m.y., allowing the formation of relatively clean and persistent chemical carbonate precipitates under large shallow marine areas.
Many fresh carbonate rocks from the Quadrilatero Ferrifero have CaO/MgO ratios that average 1.45 to 1.7 (table 25), indicating nearly pure dolomite. Compared to rocks elsewhere in the world, they are rich in manganese and to a lesser extent in iron (table 25). The average world value for MnO/FeO + Fe2O3 in carbonate rocks is 0.040, (Graf, 1960, p. 25) ; except for one analysis, carbonate rocks of the Quadrilatero Ferrifero average from 0.18 to 0.39. In dolomite-rich rocks, laminae of dolomite, magnetite, and talc(?) are about 1 to 5 mm in thickness.

The thickest carbonate beds are in the Gandarela Formation; they are interbedded with and gradational into iron formation (Dorr, 1958, p. 63).
Some thick dolomitic beds may contain very complicated minor flowage structures (Wallace, 1965, fig. 25). Intraformational conglomerate in the Gandarela Formation of the Gandarela quadrangle consists of angular and subrouncled to rounded fragments of dolomite, quartzite (chert?), and quartz in a matrix of fine dolomite (J. E. O'Rourke, written commun., 1954).
Dolomite in the Fecho do Funil Formation is dark brown to dark gray and contains much calcite (fig. 35) ; the purer dolomite of the Gandarela Formation is light gray or green but the upper parts of the formation are light yellow or red (O'Eourke, written commun., 1954). The size of dolomite grains averages about 0.02 to 0.05 mm; muscovite, phlogopite, quartz, epidote, chlorite, iron oxides (especially magnetite) and amphiboles (largely tremolite) are accessory minerals. The micas generally form discrete flakes and quartz very fine grains scattered throughout the groundmass. Where relatively pure dolomite grades

into phyllite or itabirites, a compositional layering of dolomite and quartz-mica or iron minerals and carbonate is developed.
The dolomite grains generally have sharp, nearly planar boundaries. Some rare unit rhombs may be present, but most of the planar faces are probably irrational (F. J. Turner, written commun., 1962). All quartz grains are rounded and apparently detrital in origin.
Dolomite commonly replaces quartz in magnetitechlorite itabirite (Guild, 1957, p. 15). Where dolomite is only an accessory mineral, it is found in the quartzrich layers; the iron oxides and some chlorite comprise alternate layers.
"Lapa seca" in the Nova Lima Group (table 26) consists predominantly of poorly layered quartz and dolomite or ankerite and accessory muscovite, albiteoligoclase, chlorite, magnetite, and other minerals (Gair, 1962). Quartz and carbonate commonly form fine-grained mosaic intergrowths. Other important units of the Nova Lima Group include iron formation, consisting of quartz-siderite-magnetite and accessory chlorite, muscovite, feldspar, and sulfides (Gair, 1962, p. 17).
No significant mineralogical change took place during the progressive metamorphism of most of the car-

bonate sediments. Inasmuch as metamorphism took place under a presumed depth of burial of 10 km or more, the effective total pressures prevented a breakdown of the carbonate minerals and the release of CO2. Carbonates that were relatively rich in Ca recrystallized into coarse-grained marbles. In the more Mg-rich carbonates, dolomite recrystallized as fine- to medium-grained crystals which commonly show irrational planar faces (F. J. Turner, written commun., 1962). Presumably much of iron and manganese entered dolomite as mixed crystals of ankerite and rhodochrosite.
Some tremolite and clinozoisite formed from the breakdown of dolomite hear zones of shearing where CO2 escaped during reactions such as calcite + chlorite + silica -» actinolite+epidote+H2O+CO2 (Ramberg, 1952, p. 140) or dolomite+silica+H2O-» tremolite+ calcite+CO2 (Deer and others 1963a, p. 258). Presumably a low-Al tremolite-actinolite formed which was stable in association with clinozoisite-dolomitequartz (-calcite) throughout the greenschist facies (Turner and Verhoogen, 1960, p. 536). The association here of cummingtonite with tremolite, carbonate, and quartz indicates the almandine-amphibolite facies.
Some amphibolite in the Quadrilatero Ferrifero may have formed from "dirty" carbonate rocks. This

C58 REGIONAL GEOLOGY OF THE QUADRILATERO FERRlFERO, MINAS GERAIS, BRAZIL

is suggested by both the chemical composition of the amphibolite (table 29) and their occurrence in stratigraphic positions which are equivalent to those of carbonate formations in adjoining areas. Such amphibolite, however, is found only in the highest metamorphic zones of the area, as around the Ba^ao Complex and in the Monlevade district. Carbonate minerals are not present in the amphibolite nor have transitional marble-amphibolite rocks been found, so definite field evidence for a carbonate-rock origin for amphibolite is not yet forthcoming.
Because the clinozoisite and amphiboles that developed in the low-pressure shear zones are typical of the greenschist facies, it must be concluded that shearing and concomitant metamorphism took place at relatively low temperature. This may have occurred after both the principal phase of mineral metamorphism in the 1,350 m.y. event and the structural deformation which followed it. Widespread retrograde metamorphism, as well as calc-silicate reactions in carbonate rocks, took place at one or more times (1,350?, 1,000?, 500 m.y.?) during structural deformation and the periods of relaxation of pressure that followed.
QUARTZ-RICH ROCKS
Quartzites and quartz-rich rocks make up the bulk of the Moeda (Wallace, 1958), Cercadinho, and Tabooes Formations (Pomerene, 1958) of the Minas Series, a large part of the Maquine Group (Dorr and others, 1957) and the Itacolomi (Barbosa in Dorr and others, 1959/1961) and occur in the pre-Minas Nova Lima Group and in the Sabara Formation (Gair, 1958b) of the Minas Series.
The Moeda and Tabooes quartzites are rather pure; the Palmital Formation of the Maquine Group and parts of the Moeda are sericitic and micaceous; and the Cercadinho Formation and the Itacolomi and Rio das Velhas Series are ferruginous. Some quartzite in the Palmital Formation contains as much as 30 percent chloritoid (J. E. O'Rourke, written commun., 1954). Generally, more massive quartzites are pure and form bold ridges, whereas mica-rich varieties may be friable and weather relatively rapidly, forming topographic lows.
Many quartzites have an inequigranular fine to coarse texture, as, for example, the Casa Forte Formation of the Maquine Group, (Gair, 1962, p. 32). A mortar matrix around larger detrital grains suggests cataclasis. Essential chloritoid or kyanite of some quartzites forms small clusters of isolated crystals alined either parallel to or across the foliation (fig.

22). Micaceous minerals and elongated quartz may be abundant along bedding plans.
In ferruginous quartzite, quartz is generally in even rounded grains or mosaic intergrowths elongated parallel to the compositional layering and separated by interstitial platy or granular hematite. Both hematite and quartz are detrital in origin. Very large magnetite crystals in the Cercadinho Formation in the Itabirito quadrangle at N7,150, E400, apparently are postmetamorphic (Wallace, 1965, p. 19). The ferruginous quartzites are generally well layered, quartz-rich layers alternating with hematite-rich ones..
GRAYWACKES AND FELDSPATHIC QUARTZITES
Graywacke, subgraywacke, and arkose (Pettijohn 1957, p. 291) contain detrital feldspar. Arkoses and feldspathic quartzites grade into feldspar-bearing phyllites in the Nova Lima Group west of the Serra do Maquine and into quartzites in the Maquine Group of the Serra do Maquine (J. E. O'Rourke, written commun., 1954) and in the Itacolomi Series of the Ouro Preto area (Barbosa in Dorr and others, 1959/ 1961, p. 82) . Although arkose and feldspathic quartzite are widespread, they are nowhere well enough developed to have been mapped separately.
Rocks of the graywacke suite in this area are generally dark gray and have a fine-grained granular matrix consisting largely of quartz and varying amounts of sericite, chlorite, and epidote. Some generally medium-grained quartz and albite-oligoclase appear to be detrital. In addition to detrital feldspar, microcline of metasomatic origin is locally abundant near granite contacts. Accessory minerals include carbonate, sphene and leucoxene, magnetite and hematite, apatite, and tourmaline.
Faint to strong planar structure is caused by alined chlorite or sericite. Detrital fragments of quartz and feldspar may be elongated parallel to foliation and augen structure results from micaceous minerals wrapping around larger quartz and feldspar. Porphyroblasts of biotite occur in the Sabara Formation north of the Serra do Curral near the contact with granite.
The chemical analysis of a graywacke from the Quadrilatero Ferrifero (JG241-55, table 27) is remarkably similar to that of average graywacke given by Pettijohn ( rib. 7, table 27), differing mainly in having higher A12O3, probably because of greater chemical weathering in the source area, and in having lower water, because of metamorphism.
The minor element abundance in sample JG-241-55 (table 28) compares closely with the average abundances of minor elements in pelitic sediments of the

METAMORPHIC ROCKS

C59

Quadrilatero Ferrifero (table 22) except that strontium is 10-100 times more abundant in the graywacke. Strontium substitutes diadochically for calcium, which is also proportionally more abundant, and both are largely in the abundant plagioclase of the graywacke.
Subgraywacke in the Quadrilatero Ferrifero (A5053, table 27) is similar to subgraywacke cited by PettiJohn (1957, p. 319; no. 8, table 27), but has less H2O because of metamorphism and more Na2O because of a higher contained plagioclase.

The analyzed subgraywacke has more biotite and chlorite than the other quartz-rich rocks (table 27) and correspondingly more Cr and Ni, but less than the amounts of Cr and Ni in the pelitic rocks (table 22).
The development of biotite from chlorite, finegrained muscovite, and quartz is the criterion used for distinguishing the metamorphic graywackes and feldspathic quartzites of low, medium, and high grade. The anorthite content of plagioclase is not reliable as a measure of low to moderate grades of metamorphism

because much plagioclase appears to be detrital in origin. Graywackes of the amphibolite and higher metamorphic grades do not exist in the area, and it is assumed that they are represented by biotite gneiss, which is almost identical chemically (compare biotite gneiss Ha-37 to metagraywacke JG241-55, table 27).
Graywacke from the base of the Minas Series about 4 km southwest of Sabara contains large detrital quartz and feldspar in a matrix of fine-grained quartz, biotite, chlorite, sericite, epidote, and magnetite (sample A-5053, table 27). The rock is moderately metamorphosed and contains the outermost biotite in the metamorphic aureole bordering the granite to the north.
Kyanite in quartzite as in the Serra do Cara§a (table 13) and east of the Itabira district (Dorr and Barbosa, 1963, p. 40) reflects metamorphism above the chlorite isograd, as does garnet near the Bagao Complex (table 20). Kyanite and garnet are generally euhedral porphyroblasts with some muscovite in a granular medium-to coarse-grained matrix. Kyanitequartz-muscovite veins are associated with kyanitebearing quartzites and may be largely derived from material already present in the country rpck itself (Herz and Dutra, 1964).

METAMORPHISM
During low-grade metamorphism, the clay minerals in the quartzo-feldspathic rocks were converted largely

C60 REGIONAL GEOLOGY OF THE QUADRILATERO FERRIFERO, MINAS GERAIS, BRAZIL

to sericite and muscovite. Porphyroblasts of albite or potassium-feldspar locally adjacent to granite contacts may be related more to metasomatism than progressive metamorphism (fig. 36).

FIGUBE 36. Photomicrograph, microcline gneiss with large porphyroblast of potassium-feldspar, Z-46, Rio de Pedras quadrangle, crossed nicols. Large augen of potassium-feldspar (k) and granular albite (a) and quartz comprise more than half of the gneiss. Large quartz grains (q) are strained. Large microcline crystals replace the granular quartz and appear to be of metasomatic origin. Mafic mineral is mainly biotite (b).
In quartz-rich metasedimentary rocks that had little primary clay, no significant differences in mineralogy are found between the lowest and highest grades of metamorphism. The principal changes are development of sutured textures and the growth of some grains at the expense of others, resulting in two grain sizes, one coarse and irregular in outline and the other fine and rounded.
An extremely fine-grained quartzite that is similar to Arkansas novaculite occurs in the Belo Horizonte and Ibirite quadrangles and may be a large xenolith within granite gneiss (Pomerene, 1964, p. 28).
These quartz-rich rocks are best shown on an ACF diagram (C apex represents CaO) (figs. 37, 38) because they have less K2O and more CaO than the pelitic rocks. In many relatively unweathered quartzitic rocks, plagioclase is fresh and preserves its original Na2O content. In quartz-rich rocks containing a high amount of clay minerals in addition to feldspar, metamorphic mineral assemblage are similar to those of phyllite. Sample JG241-55, for instance (table 27), a

FIGURE 37. Low-grade ACF diagram. Sample shown is finegrained quartzite in the Belo Horizonte and Ibirite quadrangles A=Al2O3+Fe2O3-(Na2O-f-K2O+CaO), C=CaO, F= MgO+FeO+MnO. Numbers next to points are sample numbers.
graywacke, is composed of plagioclase An18, quartz, epidote, chlorite, sericite, carbonate, and sphene, an assemblage that is stable from the greenschist facies to the staurolite-almandine subfacies of the almandineamphibolite facies (Turner and Verhoogen, 1960, p. 545). It falls within the epidote-chlorite-muscovite field in the low-grade ACF diagram (fig. 37), which is appropriate for its actual mineralogy.
Although it is possible that the plagioclase An18, is pre-detrital, it is more probable that its composition is a result of the last regional metamorphism because (1) most grains have lost their original boundaries by metamorphic recrystallization, and (2) the plagioclase map (pi. 1) shows that the amount of anorthite molecule in plagioclase increases to the east. The metagraywacke has about the correct amount of anorthite for its position between samples that contain plagioclase, An5_i0 to the west and An22-3o to the east. Although key mafic minerals are missing, the plagioclase suggests the almandine-amphibolite-metamorphic facies. Chlorite is ripidolite (optical determination) which is intermediate Fe-Mg in composition; a high iron chlorite would be unstable under these conditions.
Only quartzo-feldspathic rocks fall within the muscovite-chlorite-microcline field, the K-rich part of the AKF diagram representing the almandine amphibolite metamorphic facies. The high Al compared to

alkalis of some pelitic rocks aided the formation of muscovite and kyanite and inhibited that of feldspar and biotite, which was also inhibited by low F. The minerals in the quartz-rich rocks, except for plagioclase, are not diagnostic of any particular metamorphic zone. The almandine-amphibolite facies of regional metaniorphism was attained in the Monlevade area as shown by the assemblage biotite, quartz, and plagioclase An27.32 in biotite gneiss (Ha-37 and Ha39, table 27.) Epidote and garnet are also present in Ha-37. Plagioclase Aiio5_32 is found in some "impure1' sandstones of the almandine-amphibolite facies together with some microcline.
AMPHIBOLITE AND GREENSTONE
Greenstone metavolcaiiic rock of mafic to intermediate composition is found in the Nova Lima Group and in the Sabara Formation (Gair, 1962, p. 13; 1958b, p. 68) and above the Caue Itabirite in the Congonhas district, the Dom Bosco quadrangle (iigs. 10, 11), Monlevade district, and the Catas Altas quadrangle.
The greenstone is massive or schistose and is composed of chlorite and epidote, and, in places, a deepgreen amphibole, plus accessory albite or oligoclase, quartz, carbonate, magnetite, biotite, and ilmenite. Original structures generally have been destroyed by metaniorphism, but some samples have relict diabasic texture or other textural evidence of igneous origin. Deep-green amphibole or mixed epidote-sericite (saussurite) commonly appear to be pseudomorphic after earlier mafic minerals or calcium-rich feldspar (Herz, 1970, fig. 2-1). Some quartz is present in stretched amygdules (?), and some in association with carbonate is a metamorphic replacement of primary minerals.
A probable acid flow or tuff from the Congonhas district is gray, fine grained, and contains abundant rounded quartz grains 1 to 2 mm across, very fine grained alined sericite, cryptocrystalliiie quartz (?), and minor amounts of plagioclase and microcline (Guild 1957, p. 19-20). Some poorly defined fragments suggest that the rock was a welded crystal tuff.
Layers of amphibolite occur in pre-Minas rocks, in the Gandarela and Piracicaba Formations, or less importantly in other formations in the Monlevade (Reeves, 1966), Itabira (Dorr and Barbosa, 1963), and Eio de Pedras quadrangles. Before metaniorphism, the amphibolites were mafic igneous rock or impure dolomite or graywacke.
Joseph E. O'Eourke (written commun., 1954) distinguished three types of amphibolites in the Eio de Pedras quadrangle that occur in the zone between the

granitic gneisses of the Bagao Complex and the metamorphosed sedimentary rocks to the north: (1) A compact, massive, coarsely crystalline rock composed of green hornblende (60-95 percent) and subsidiary amounts of biotite, plagioclase An34, epidote, quartz, magnetite, and garnet. This is the most abundant type and is conformable with the foliation of high-r^nk metamorphic rocks and is always found within 300
meters of granitic gneiss; (2) A compact, thin-bedded rock comprised of fine laminae of hornblende (40-70 percent), quartz, and accessory epidote, plagioclase, chlorite, and sericite. This rock is interbedded with chloritic phyllite or biotite schist in the low-rank eige of the intermediate zone of metaniorphism more than 400 meters from the granite gneiss; (3) A rock com-
posed of thin laminae of hornblende (50-80 percent), quartz (20-30 percent), and magnetite (5-40 percent) and rare plagioclase and biotite; occurs interbedded with type 1 at two localities in the Eio de Pedras quadrangle within 150 meters of granite gneiss.
Amphibolite from the southern contact area of the Bagao Complex in the Nova Lima Group from the Dom Bosco quadrangle (J-155 C) and the Cachoeira do Campo quadrangle (J-10, tables 29, 30) has ex-
ceptionally low Na 2O and K2O compared to typical mafic rocks (Turner and Verhoogen, 1960, p. 215) and to amphibolite in other parts of the Quadrilatero Ferrifero.
In the Monlevade area, the Monlevade gneiss contains the Pacas Amphibolite Member and the Itabira Group contains the Sitio Largo Amphibolite (Eeeves, 1966). The Sitio Largo is well laminated, dark green, is composed largely of hornblende, quartz, and plagioclase, and is similar to some pre-Minas amphibolite. Amphibolite intimately associated with soapstone in the Itabira district is metamorphosed ultramafic and
mafic rock intrusive into pre-Minas rocks (Dorr and Barbosa, 1963, p. 34). Xeiioliths of finely laminated amphibolite occur in the granitic rocks north of Pelo Horizoiite (Ha-16x, table 29). They consist of coarsegrained brown hornblende and plagioclase, as large as 0.5-8 mm in diameter, and accessory quartz, magnetite, apatite, colorless amphibole, and sphene.
J. E. O'Eourke (written coinm., 1954) considered that his types (1) and (3) were genetically related to the gneiss of the Bagao Complex as a "basic front" and that type (2) represented a metamorphosed carbonate-rich bed within the chlorite phyllites. It is also possible that (2) represents a metamorphosed basic
tuff and (1) and (3) are metamorphosed mafic dikes. Other geologists have proposed other modes of origin for amphibolite.

Chemical analysis of amphibolite taken from different parts of the Quadrilatero Ferrifero (table 29) were plotted on an ACF diagram for the amphibolite metamorphic facies (fig. 38). The analyses from the Monlevade district all plot within a very small area of the hornblende-almandine-epidote field, whereas analyses from other areas do not fall within that field. The amphibolites from Monlevade probably occur at different stratigraphic horizons and different modes of

origin have been ascribed to them, although they are chemically, as well as mineralogically, quite similar.
The average Monlevade amphibolite was compared to a hypothetical sedimentary antecedent a? well as to an igneous one (table 31). The sediment is based on a combination of 20 percent average dolomite from the Dom Bosco quadrangle and 80 percent average pelite from the Quadrilatero Ferrifero; the igneous rock is Johannsen's average for basalt (1937, p. _^1).

The average Monlevade amphibolite is chemically similar to average basalt. Amphibolites from elsewhere in the Quadrilatero Ferrifero, on the other hand, are chemically dissimilar to one another and generally to the theoretical or average basalt. These differences indicate that amphibolite originated in more than one way in the Quadrilatero Ferrifero.
Evidence on the origin of amphibolite can be obtained from plots of Niggli numbers (Leake, 1963). Amphibolite derived by igneous differentiation tends to fall on or near the igneous trend curve shown by

analyses of Karroo dolerite in a diagram of Niggli mg values plotted against c or in the triangular diagram of mg vs. c vs. alk', amphibolite of probable sedimentary origin does not fall near the curve.
All amphibolites from the Quadrilatero Ferrifero, except J-10 and J-155, group into a small area near the igneous trend curve of the c-mg plot (fig. 3P.5). The plots for alk - mg and ti-mg are not as clear, although, again, neither J-10 nor J-155 fall near the clusters made by the other samples, which suggests that they have a different origin.
In a triangular diagram of mg-c-alk, the analyses again cluster into a small area except for J-155 and J-10, that represents middle-stage differentiates of a mafic magma. J-155 apparently represents a mixture that included pelitic material and calcium carbonate and J-10, pelitic material and dolomite.
Chemical composition can also be used to test for origin by using a multivariate analysis of the major oxide values and calculating discriminant functions (Shaw and Kudo, 1965). In this type of analysiV a positive discriminant-function value suggests or^hoamphibolite and a negative value represents p^raamphibolite with a probability of incorrect classification of 5.7 percent. Values shown in table 29 s^iow high negative values for J155C ( 3.53) and J-10 (-2.93) and high positive values for Ha-16x ( + 2.32), K-271 ( + 1.96), and R-421 ( + 2.90). The discriminant function value thus suggests that the amphibolite? in and near the Bacjio Complex (J-10, J-155C) are metamorphosed sediments; the Pacas Amphibolite Member of the Monlevade gneiss is of igneous origin (R271, R421), as is the xenolith in granite near Pelo Horizonte (Ha-16X). Values for the Sitio Lr.rgo Amphibolite cluster near zero and indeed average out to about zero, -0.33, -1.01, +0.88, and the value for the Elefante Formation is low and negative, T..44. These low values are not conclusive evidence for any one mode of origin.
The amphibolites contain equilibrium mineral assemblages typical of rocks having excess SiO2 in the staurolite-almandine subfacies of the almandine- amphibolite facies (Turner and Verhoogen, 1960, p. 546). Most of them are in the epidote-almandine-hornble.nde field of the ACF diagram (fig. 38) and also typically contain andesine, quartz, biotite, and actinolite.

detrital origin are found in the Piracicaba Group and the Itacolomi Series. Most post-Rio das Velhas ironformation belongs to the oxide facies (James, 1954), whereas most iron-formation of the Eio Das Velhas Series probably belong to the carbonate facies (Dorr and others, 1957, p. 18).
Iron-formation is a thinly bedded rock containing alternating layers rich in iron oxide, iron carbonate, or quartz. Beds in the Caue Itabirite are as much as several hundred meters thick and are continuously mappable from one side of the region to the other. In other formations, iron-formation is generally lenticular and rarely as much as 100 m thick. Hematite and quartz, or magnetite and carbonate, are essential minerals; amphlboles, talc, kaolinite, chlorite, muscovite, and sultides may be accessory minerals. Quartz tends to be tine and even grained and have a sutured texture. The grain size of iron oxides and quartz appears to vary with degree of metamorphism. In the western part of the area, hematite is generally smaller than 0.05 mm; in the eastern part, in the Monlevade and Itabira quadrangles, some quartz is larger than 1 mm in diameter. Hematite generally occurs as tabular plates or irregular grains and is most abundant in quartz-rich oxide-facies iron-formation. Magnetite

occurs as euhedral grains in the carbonate-rich ironformation (Dorr, 1958, p. 62).
Most oxide-facies iron-formation has no accessory minerals (fig. 17). Isolated flakes or radiating groups of talc or kaolinite less than 0.5 mm in length rarely occur and tremolite-actinolite and other amphitoles are developed in the Brumadinho and Sao Juliao quadrangles. A deep-green iron-rich chlorite having a high median index of refraction in carbonate-frcies iron-formation of the Nova Lima Group resembles greenalite and is associated with magnetite. Siderite, ankerite, or ferrodolomite are the carbonate minerals (Gair, 1962, p. 17-18). In the Minas Series, the only carbonate in iron formation is dolomite. Late sulfides in rocks of the Nova Lima Group form blebs and veinlets that cut bedding surfaces.
Most available chemical analyses of oxide-f?,cies iron-formation from the Quadrilatero Ferrifero show only total iron, SiO2, A12O3 P2O5, and MnO (table 3:2). Chemical analyses of dolomitic itabirite, carbonate-facies iron-formation, (table 33) and ironformation of relatively high inetamorphic grade (also table 32) are generally more complete. Minor elements were determined only from iron-formation of relatively high inetamorphic grade (table 33).

Iron-formation with the high-temperature iron silicate minerals, andradite, hedenbergite, and grunerite, is uncommon in the area. Generally, increasing temperature and pressure during metamorphism only caused the itabirite to become coarser grained. Thus the typical oxide-facies assemblage of quartz and hematite, plus magnetite in places (James, 1955, p. 1475), is characteristic of low- to high-grade metamorphic zones (table 34). The scarce iron silicates are interpreted to be products of the metamorphism of dolomitic iron-formation.
Comparitively pure itabirite occurs in the pre-Minas Monlevade gneiss in the staurolite zone and is indistinguishable from Caue Itabirite (Reeves, 1966 p. 10). Caue Itabirite in the biotite or staurolite zones in the Itabira district is finely laminated and is composed of specularite, 0.01 to 0.1 mm in size, angular granoblastic quartz grains, 0.04 to 0.4 mm in size, minor magnetite as small euhedra, and traces of talc (Dorr and Barbosa, 1963, p. 19). The itabirite from Monlevade and Itabira is similar to itabirite of the chlorite zone except for having abundant specularite and coarser grain sizes.
High-temperature silicate minerals occur in ironformation in the Dom Bosco (J-687-1, table 32, ref. no. 13), Itabira, Santa Luzia (H-24n, table 32, ref. no. 11), Piedade, Ba?ao (R-108-54, table 32, ref. no. 10), and Nova Lima quadrangles. Most of the ironformation belongs to the Itabira Group, but north of the Serra do Curral and in other structurally complicated areas stratigraphic relationships are uncertain and the iron-formation may belong to the Piracicaba or the Nova Lima Groups. Iron-formation of high metamorphic grade, as J-687-1, for example, has alter-

nating layers of light-green quartz-magnetite-actinolite and dark-gray diopside-specularite actinolite, 1 to 3 mm thick. Quartz grains are 0.1 to 0.4 mm in size and diopside grains average 0.04 mm. Rare carbonate grains occur in the quartz-rich layers. In iron-formation in the Santa Luzia quadrangle, garnet forms almost pure layers, except for some grunerite, that are 1 to 3 mm thick (fig. 28). Alternating layers are rich in quartz, grains of which are 0.1 to 0.3 mm in diameter, and pyroxene, grunerite, and magnetite.
Mineralogic changes in itabirites during metamorphism are identical to those reported by JgMnes (1955) for hematite-banded oxide-facies iron-formation of northern Michigan. At intermediate metamorphic grades, some hematite changes to specular hematite, but the most important change is an increase in grain size of quartz in layers of relatively pure chert. In the chlorite and biotite zones the diameter of typical quartz grains is less than 0.1 mm; in the garnet and staurolite zones, 0.1 to 0.2 mm; and in the sillimanite zone, more than 0.2 mm. Actinolite and cuiimingtonite are also minor accessory minerals.
In the Quadrilatero Ferrifero, quartz grains in layers of recrystallized chert also increase in grain size during metamorphism (table 9). In the western part of the area, as in the Fecho do Funil, Ibirite, and Belo Horizonte quadrangles, grain sizes range from 0.01 to 0.086 mm and average 0.03 to 0.04 mm. In the Congonhas district, the range is 0.01 to 0.1 mm, and in the Nova Lima and Dom Bosco quadrangles it is 0.05 to 0.4 mm, the average being 0.13 mm in Dom Bosco. In the extreme eastern part, as in the Itabira and Monlevade districts, the common range in size is

also 0.04 to 0.4; some quartz grains are as large as 1 mm or more. Although none of these rocks are within the sillimanite zone, many have quartz grains greater than 0.2 mm in diameter, a grain size typical of that zone in northern Michigan (James, 1955).
Carbonate-bearing oxide-facies iron-formation consists of calcite or dolomite, quartz, magnetite, and hematite and in places undergoes important mineralogic changes during metamorphism. Although no single beds can be traced continuously from areas of low to high metamorphic grade, iron-formation of high metamorphic grade originated as carbonate-bearing itabirite and not "pure" itabirite, as suggested by CaO + MgO contents of about 10 to 16 percent (samples 11-13, table 32).
Good evidence that iron-formation of high metamorphic grade is derived from dolomitic itabirite is also seen in the Dom Bosco quadrangle (Johnson, 1962, p. 31). Chemical analyses of a diopside-bearing iron-formation (J-687-1) and of a dolomitic itabirite (J-764) from the same general area are similar (table 35) and indicate that: (1) the diopside-bearing ironformation is derived from dolomitic itabirite and (2) that metamorphism was essentially isochemical, except for a loss of H2O and CO2.

igneous intrusion north of the Serra do Curral (Gair, 1962, p. 52) and around the Bagao Complex (Johnson, 1962, p. 25-26) is proof of a temperature gradient due to igneous activity. In both places, staurolite, andesine-oligoclase, and garnet are present near the granitic rocks, whereas chlorite, albite, and other minerals typical of the chlorite zone of metamorpl ism occur at some distance from the granites.
An approximate idea of metamorphic grade can be obtained from the degree of granularity in recryptallized metamorphic rocks as well as from indicator minerals. The grain size of quartz in quartz-rich bands if iron-formation increases with increasing metamorphic grade in northern Michigan (James 195£ p. 1474-1475) as well as in the Quadrilatero Ferrifero. Grain size can also be used in rocks other than ironformation, but no quantitative measure has been established. Coarse-grained chlorite in schist formed at higher temperatures than fine-grained mats of chloritesericite in phyllite.
In the present study, relative or absolute geologic temperatures have been determined by both the measure of grain sizes and the identification of mir^ral pairs or solid-solution series in mineral groups whose mutual reactions fix a temperature.

METAMORPHIC TEMPERATURES

There is good geologic evidence that at least three metamorphic events took place (Herz, 1970) and that during each period of metamorphism, temperatures were not uniform throughout the area but depended on thermal gradients away from granitic intrusions. Post-Minas metamorphism may have been progressive early and retrograde late in the same cycle, as evinced in rocks of the Minas Series by chloritization of biotite and garnet, replacement of kyanite by pyrophyllite, and saussuritization of plagioclase. The zonal arrangement of metamorphic minerals bordering on

PARAGONITE-MUSCOVITE SOLID SOLUTION
In systems that are saturated with respect to sodium, the amount of the Na-mica, paragonite, to enter muscovite is directly dependent on the temperature of formation (Eugster and Yoder, 1955, p. 125). To be sure of excess sodium, albite and paragonite should both be present in the rock as separate mineral phaser
An X-ray diffractometer study was made of. 12 samples suspected of having both paragonite and muscovite (table 6), but only muscovite was fonnd. Sodium is low in nearly all the pelitic (table 21) and quartzitic rocks (table 27) of the area and presumably entered muscovite as paragonite solid solution. Albite is present in some quartzite that contains a few percent Na2O, but because paragonite is not present as an independent phase, sodium that entered muscovite was controlled by its availability and not by temperature.
DOLOMITE-CALCITE SOLID SOLUTION
In metamorphosed carbonate rocks, the temperature of recrystallization can be determined if calcite and dolomite coexisted at the time of metamorphism. Ideally, the system should be saturated with respect to magnesium, shown by the crystallization of c"olo-

C68 REGIONAL GEOLOGY OF THE QUADRILATERO FERRIFERO, MINAS GERAIS, BRAZIL

mite as an independent phase, so that excess magnesium can be free to enter calcite as a solid solution (Graf and Goldsmith, 1955). The curve relating temperature to mole percentage of MgCO3 in calcite (Graf and Goldsmith, 1958) shows a variation ranging from about 5 percent MgCO3 at 500°C to 18 percent at 800°C. The reaction does not vary with CO2 pressure.
Fourteen carbonate samples from various parts of the Quadrilatero Ferrifero were analyzed with a Philips X-ray diffractometer running at 1° 26 per minute using Cu K« radiation, between 26° and 34° '26. Dolomite has a strong reflection at about 30.9° and calcite at about 29.5°; these reflections increase with increasing dolomite solid solution.
Eleven of the samples have only one carbonate; one has only calcite and the other 10, only dolomite. The three samples that have both carbonates were rerun at 1/8° 200 per minute (table 36). Because all have low amounts of dolomite in solid solution and so fall near the origin and in the steepest part of the curve of Graf and Goldsmith (1958), the temperature determinations should be considered only an order of magnitude.
The indicated temperatures of about 400 °C for the chlorite-bearing rock (J-134) and 550°C for the biotite-bearing rock with the gash veins (J-390) indicate temperature conditions of the middle and uppermost parts of the greenschist facies, respectively (Turner and Verhoogen, 1960, p. 534).

DOLOMITE-SIDERITE SOLID SOLUTION

The geothermometric concepts outlined for dolomitecalcite solid solution apply equally well to other carbonate mineral pairs. David E. Wones, U.S. Geological Survey, (written commun., 1966) determined the compositions of siderite and dolomite from vein material of the Morro Velho mine by unit cell and optical data:

Composition

Dolomite __ Ca.RMg.44Fe.o5CO3 4.814 ± .001 16.048 ± .006 1.692 Siderite __ Fe.asMg.sTCOs 4.670 ± .001 15.234 ± .005 1.803
Assuming that (1) little or no manganese is present and (2) that the dolomite-ferroan calcite tie lines given by Goldsmith and others (1962) are subparallel, a crude estimate of temperature of 400°C±75° can be made.

PYRRHOTITE-PYRITE SOLID SOLUTION
The mineral pair, pyrrhotite-pyrite, has been used as a geological thermometer, by measuring the atomic percentage of Fe in pyrrhotite (Arnold, 1958). Temperatures can be obtained in the range from. 300°C, to about 743°. An approximate temperature of 325°C was determined for pyrite-pyrrhotite fron the Morro Velho mine (E. G. Arnold in Gair, 1962, p. 56). This is well within the temperature of the lower greenschist metamorphic facies as also indicated by the chlorite-albite-quartz assemblage in the wall rock.

Some talc(?) is also present.

REACTIONS IN SILICEOUS CARBONATES
Quartz and calcite coexisting below 600 °C react under temperature conditions of 600°C to about 800°C and pressure conditions of 5,000 to about 50,000 Ibs. p.s.i. to form wollastonite: CaCO3 + SiO2-»CaSiO3 + CO2 (Harker and Tuttle, 1956). At a minimum depth of burial of 5 km, a temperature of about 750 °C would have been necessary to produce wollastonite from siliceous carbonates; the lack of wollastonite in the area, shows that temperatures did not exceed 750 °C.
Coexisting dolomite and quartz react between about 300°C to 550°C at pressures ranging from 0 to 5,000 atmospheres to form diopside: CaMg(COr) 2 + 2SiO2-» CaMg(SiO3 ) 2 + 2CO2 (Weeks, 1956). Diopside formed by this reaction in beds of dolomitic itabirite in the Passagem gold mine (fig. 5), in the Dom Bosco quadrangle north of the Serra do Ouro Branco (J-687-1, table 32, no. 13), Itabira, and Santa Luzia quadrangles (fig. 28). Assuming a depth of burial of 8 km, according to the equilibrium pressure/temperature curves of Weeks (1956, p. 259), the temperature necessary for

METAMORPHIC ROCKS

C69

the reaction to proceed is about 490°C; at a depth of burial of 12.5 km, the necessary temperature is about 520°C. From these data, it can be assumed that throughout most of the area, the temperature did not much exceed about 500°C; if it had, diopside would be much more common in dolomitic itabirite. Diopside in the area probably formed at temperatures above 500°C but below 750°, judging by the absence of wollastonite in beds of the proper chemical composition.
ALBITE IN 1»LAGIOCLASE AND ALKALI FELDSPAR
Barth (1956) suggested that the mole fraction of albite in potassium-feldspar compared to that in plagioclase should vary with temperature and pressure. Feldspars were separated from gneisses and granites and the albite molecule was determined in potassiumfeldspar by chemical analysis and in plagioclase by indices of refraction (Herz and Dutra, 1966). Nine samples showed temperatures of crystallization or recrystallization ranging from 380°C to 430°C temperatures expected in the lower green-schist facies of metamorphism. A sample of granite gneiss from Engenheiro Correa indicated 460°C, a granodiorite from Congonhas, 570°C, and a post-tectonic granite from Peti, 610°C.
ORGANIC COMPOUNDS IN PHYLLITES
Samples of "graphitic" phyllite were collected by G. C. Simmons from (1) the Barreiro Formation at its type locality in the northeast part of the Ibirite quadrangle (Pomerene, 1958, p. 67), (2) from the Batatal Formation, (3) from the Nova Lima Group, 300 m underground in the Raposas mine, and (4) from the Cercadinho Formation near Fazenda Alegria.
Irving Breger, U.S. Geological Survey, (written commun., 1966) isolated unsaturated fatty acids from the first three samples. Since these compounds break down at temperatures greater than about 200°C, it must be assumed that in some places in the Quadrilatero Ferrifero, the temperature never rose higher than 300°C, which is lower than the minimum temperature suggested for the greenschist facies (Turner and Verhoogen, 1960, p. 534).
PETROLOGY
Granitic intrusions are directly related to some local rises in the grade of metamorphism. Increases in metamorphic grade are generally shown by an aureole in the country rock that parallels the contact with the intrusive, as is seen north of the Serra do Curral and

around the Bagao Complex. Towards the eastern and southern parts of the area, however, metamorphic grade increases and metamorphic mineral assemblages are typical of the Barrovian-type of regional dynamothermal metamorphism (Miyashiro, 1961, p. £79) which develops at pressures of about 2 to 5 kilobars.
It is known that at least three events were accompanied by widespread regional metamorphism (Herz and others, 1961). The last, about 500 m.y. ago, was a postMinas low-grade metamorphic event accompanied by pegmatites (Herz, 1970, p. 7); it effectively marked the effects of earlier metamorphism. Dorr and Farbosa, (1963, p. 10) stated that pre-Minas regional metamorphisms was of high grade but that its assemblages were largely destroyed by retrograde action during low-grade metamorphism of post-Minas age. Gair, (1962, p. 9), on the other hand, said that widespread, pre-Minas deformation (s) was of low metamorphic grade, except for local contact metamorphic effects, and that the most important effect of the postMinas deformation (s) was to impose deformational textures and structures on these older rocks.
Clearcut evidence for retrograde metamorphism during post-Minas orogeny is seen in contact aureoles, where biotite and garnet have been partly replaced1 by chlorite and staurolite by chloritoid. Such incipient facies changes may also be related to falling temperatures after intrusion accompanied by increased diffusion of fluids and may not necessarily indicate a later metamorphic event.
The post-Minas orogeny at 1,350-m.y. was accompanied by widespread intense mechanical deformation, which conceivably so comminuted the minerals in pre-Minas rocks that most evidence of high-grade regional metamorphism has been masked. Many preMinas quartzitic rocks, for instance, are now cataclasites (Maxwell, 1972). Certainly the deformation at 1,350 m.y. could have opened access to relatively impermeable metamorphic rocks by hydrothermal solutions. Possible evidence of original higher grade mineralogy and coarser grained textures in some preMinas rocks is shown in some almandine amphibolite metamorphic-facies contact rocks and xenoliths of post-Rio das Velhas granites.
Chloritoid and kyanite are abundant in aluminumrich rocks of specific bulk chemical compositions. They may occur in folds or other environments in which shearing or a directed pressure must have been important and in such occurrences correspond to Head's (1957, p. 362) examples of dislocation metamorphism. Shearing is equivalent to the "tectonic overpressure" of Clark (1961), and its probable local effect must have been to raise the effective total pressure and to

C70 REGIONAL GEOLOGY OF THE QUADRILlTERO FERRIFERO, MINAS GERAIS, BRAZIL

facilitate the formation of kyanite in rocks containing excess Al and Si. The development of chloritoid, however, appears to be controlled only by bulk chemical composition (see p. 56) and any control exercised by structural environment may be more apparent than real.
Cataclastic metamorphism with or without subsequent silicification is common in the major fault zones of the region. Some beds of the Cambotas Quartzite in the central part of the area were recognized and mapped on the basis of intense cataclastic structure surfaces of rupturing lying parallel or subparallel to bedding planes (Moore, 1969, p. 12-13). The cataclastic structure is characterized by a matrix of finegrained quartz and sericite around larger strained quartz grains, by crushed and partly recrystallized quartz and feldspar, and by small augen built up by mica and chlorite surrounding felsic cores.
The relative importance of metasoinatic metamorphism as a cause of widespread "granitization" is not generally agreed upon by the different geologists who worked in the region, although it is agreed that metasoinatic metamorphism may have occurred near the contact of some granitic and gneissic rocks. Such metamorphism is illustrated by small porphyroblasts of potassium-feldspar and albite in basal Moeda quartzite near a contact with intrusive granite on the southern slope of the Serra do Curral, in the Ibirite quadrangle (Pomerene, 1964, p. 36). Metasomatism is considered to have formed much of the gneiss in the Itabira district (Dorr and Barbosa, 1963).
"Ultrametamorphism" may have produced the interlayered amphibolite schist and felsic granitic rock around the Bagao Complex and other granitic-appearing rocks (Johnson, 1962, p. 22). Winkler and Platen (1961) found, at temperatures of 700°C±40° and 2,000 atmospheres ^ . pressure, that solutions of
JrisO
granitic composition formed from metamorphic rocks containing quartz and alkali feldspar; at lower temperatures, higher pressures were needed to produce the same results.
Metasomatic transport over short distances is probably responsible for kyanite-quartz veins in the quartzite of the Serra da Moeda syncline and kyanite-pyrophyllite veins in phyllite of the Serra do Itabirito (Herz and Dutra, 1964). These veins are probably similar to the recrystallization pegmatites of Ramberg (1952), in which most of the vein material is derived from the country rock itself (fig. 42).
METAMORPHIC ZONES
Metamorphic transformations can be analyzed from the viewpoint either of metamorphic zones (Turner

and Verhoogen, 1960) or metamorphic facies. On the metamorphic map (pi. 1), isograds have been drawn to show the first appearance of minerals indicative of increasing temperature-pressure zones. The chlorite zone underlies the greater part of the region. The presence, however, of high Al-Mg chlorite, which is stable to the highest grades of metamorpHsm, makes it difficult to define the low-grade chlorite zone in parts of the area.
Throughout most of the region within the biotite isograd typical rocks are chlorite-sericite-quartz schists, but some biotite is found scattered through their area of outcrop. Similarly developed widespread zones have been found in the greenschist terrane of Eastern Otago, New Zealand, on the boundary of the chlorite zone (Turner, 1938) and elsewhere. This would suggest either that (1), although the probable reaction at the biotite isograd is ferromagnesian chlorite + muscovite + silica = aluminous chlorite + biotite (Ramberg, 1952, p. 140), there exists a narrow temperature range in which all minerals are in equilibrium or that (2) the reaction frequently does not go to completion.
Chlorite from within the chlorite zone of the Quadrilatero Ferrifero (table 5) has less aluminum in both 4- and 6-coordinated positions than chlor'te from the biotite zone, so that an aluminum-rich chlorite probably accompanies the development of biotite. Where biotite first appears, it is generally interleaved with and appears to replace sericite and chlorite. Where it is abundant, it is commonly porphyroblastic. Both biotite and chlorite are also found within the staurolite zone, which is the highest of the area.
In addition to pressure/temperature conditions and bulk chemical composition, the oxygen activity as determined by the degree of oxidation of tH iron component of the rock played a role in the development of biotite. Chinner (1960, p. 187) defined the oxidation ratio (o.r.) as molecular (2Fe2O3 X 100)/(2Fe2O3 + FeO) and found that with increasing oxidation ratio, total biotite and garnet decreased whereas muscovite and iron oxides increased. Following Chinner, low o.r. (ilmenite-magnetite suite) = 0-14, moderate o.r. = 15-42, and high o.r. > 43 (magnetite-hematite suite).
Low-grade pelitic rock of the Quadri]atero Ferrifero, including slate and phyllite, has a moderate to high o.r. and biotite (table 37). The orly analyzed schist, A-4953, has a high o.r., 44.4, anc1 has biotite that has partly retrograded to chlorite, which suggests that oxidation may have accompanied retrograde metamorphism.
Biotite developed in all high-grade quartzo-felds-

Kyanite phyllite in the Cercadinho formation in the Lagoa Grande quadrangle and elsewhere is exceptionally high in A12O3 and probably represents reworked regolith below the unconformity at the base of the Piracicaba Group (Herz and Dutra, 1964).
Other polymorphs of Al2SiO5 did not form in any great abundance, evidently because P Y ,, increased in part by the tectoni.c overpressure, walsoadto' o high. Nucleation factors, suggested by the presence of Fe2O3 in all kyanite analyzed from low-grade rocks (table
15), may have facilitated the crystallization of kyanite in the lowest pressure/temperature part of its stability field. Chloritoid occurs in or near kyanitebeariiig rocks metamorphosed in the biotite zone, but is not associated with kyanite in rocks of higher metamorphic grade.
In kyanite-chlorite pelitic rock just east of the Serra do Carac,a, high total aluminum, suggested by the presence of kyanite, probably extended the stability field of the chiorite (Turnock, 1960, p. 99). If mineral transformations and structural deformation occurred
simultaneously, tectonic overpressure helped to produce a high total pressure. High pressure tends to expand the stability fields of muscovite, iron-and magnesium-rich chlorite, kyanite, and chloritoid into higher temperature fields (fig. 40).
Kyanite crystallized from low-temperature/liighpressure conditions to the highest conditions of metamorphism in the area, those of the staurolite zone. In the staurolite zone, the amount of chlorite and chloritoid diminished, chlorite became Al-Mg-rich, and biotite and muscovite formed.

Staurolite indicates the highest degree of rietamorphism in pelitic schist of the area. It is generally porphyroblastic and may replace chloritoid, but generally forms from an indeterminate metamorphi 0, reaction. Garnet, biotite, and oligoclase-andesine are typically associated with staurolite but are also found in the biotite zone. According to Halferdahl's experimental data (1961, p. 99), staurolite + almandine + hercynite + vapor replaces chloritoid at temperatures above 700° C; the breakdown of chloritoid apparently took place at much lower temperatures in the Quadrilatero Ferrifero.
Higher-temperature minerals than staurolite, such as sillimanite and cordierite in pelitic rocks anc1 pyroxene in dolomitic iron-formation occur in a few isolated places. (See discussions under Mineralogy.) Because these occurences are sporadic it is impractical to map any isograd higher than staurolite.
METASOMATIC METAMORPHISM

cations and with only water and CO2 lost in progressive metamorphic reactions (Turner and Verhoogen, 1960, p. 561). Near igneous intrusions, however, the metasomatic effects of fluids and gases on the country rock may be significant. The nature and extent of metasomatism related to igneous activity in the Quadrilatero Ferrifero is not generally agreed upon. One or another of the five general types of metasomatism of Eskola (1939, p. 375) representing additions of alkalies, lime, iron-magnesia, nonmetallic elements, and carbon dioxide, occur locally in the Quadrilatero Ferrifero.

ALKALI METASOMATISM

Wallace (1965, p. 24) found a gradaticnal contact between granite and the basal Minas quartzite of the Serra da Moeda, and O'Rourke (written commun., 1954) found one between granite gneiss of the Bagao Complex and Rio das Velhas politic rocks in the Rio de Pedras quadrangle. Coarse-grained muscovite porphyroblasts lying at an angle to the foliation of chlorite schists in the Itabira district are considered to be evidence of alkali metasomatism (Dorr and Barbosa, 1963, p. 11, fig. 3). Elsewhere in the Quadilatero Ferrifero, coarse-grained muscovite has be?.n taken to represent a consequence of regional metam orphism of K-Al-rich pelitic rocks.
Porphyroblasts of alkali feldspar occur in quartzrich rocks adjacent to granitic gneiss nortl and south of the Serra dos Tres Irmaos and west of the Serra da Moeda. In the Serra da Jangada, Ibirite quadrangle, porphyroblasts of alkali feldspar occur in quartzite and sericitic quartzite of the b^sal Moeda Formation (Pomerene, 1964, p. 32-33). T « feldspar is untwinned and appears to be the last mineral to have crystallized, replacing quartz, chlorite, and muscovite. In these cases, the porphyroblasts are present in the quartzite within 5 meters of the contact with granitic rocks. North of the Bagao Complex, myrmekitic mtergrowths of quartz and alkali feldspar occur in metasedimentary rocks near the contact with gneiss (fig. 41). Feldspar myrmekite replaces the quartz and muscovite which is generally taken to result from a deuteric stage of granitic intrusion (Howell, 1957, p. 195).
In the granite gneiss at Itabirito, replacement of biotite by muscovite (rather than by chlorite), the partial replacement of plagioclase by mufcovite, and the rimming of calcic plagioclase by albite and microcline (Herz, 1970, fig. 19) are further evidence of alkali metasomatism.
The replacement of amphibole by biotite is taken as evidence of potassium metasomatism in places. In the Quadrilatero Ferrifero, biotite having a generally high uniform iron-magnesium ratio partly replaced hornblende in magnetite-bearing amphibolite. The presence of magnetite and the uniform composition of the biotite (table 8) suggests that biotite largely reflects the primary composition of the ro°k and not metasomatic additions.

Alkali metals are abundant in salic magmatic fluids and are relatively soluble in water, so they may produce metasomatic effects near granitic contacts. Alkali elements probably become mobile under the lowest metamorphic conditions of the epidote amphibolite facies (Eamberg, 1952, p. 172).

CALCIUM METASOMATISM
The most common evidence for calcium metasomatism is the presence of calcium silicates, su°-h as diopside, grossularite, and vesuvianite, between carbonate rocks and silicate rocks or the presence of epidote in

liths in the gneiss (as Ha-16x, table 29) show that mafic rocks picked up by the granitic magma were recrystallized largely to amphibole-biotite-plagioclase assemblages, which may have been the source for the Al- and Ca-rich solutions.

METASOMATISM BY METALLIC ELEMENTS AND SILICA

Rectangular porphyroblasts of myrmekitic plagioclase, about An26 occupy most of photograph. Some grains zoned and some twinned.

mafic igneous rocks. Both these processes- have taken place in the Quadrilatero Ferrifero.
During the metamorphism of some dolomitic itabirites, CO2 was lost and Ca-Mg reacted with quartz, magnetite, and hematite to produce diopside, cummingtonite-grunerite, tremolite-actinolite, and andradite. Whether the formation of these minerals can be called metasomatism or metamorphism depends on the scale of the system considered; in the rock as a whole, the process is metamorphism, but between the layers of the rock it is metasomatism.
The appearance of vesuvianite instead of grossularite in carbonate-bearing graywackes near granitic contacts of the Belo Horizonte quadrangle (p. 49) is attributed to magmatic fluids. Ca and Al of the vesuvianite may have moved only a few millimeters or so from nearby parts of the rock, but the required OH and F have been added to the rock, probably by hydrothermal solutions.
Epidote veins averaging about 0.3 mm in width occur both in granitic gneiss and biotite-quartz-plagioclase-magnetite schist in their mutal contact zone north of the Serra do Curral. The epidote is not in contact with plagioclase of the biotite schist country rock and can be attributed to calcium-metasomatism from the nearby granitic gneiss. Numerous amphibolite xeno-

Metasomatism occurred at least over a scale of millimeters in the Dom Bosco quadrangle, where diopside formed in dolomitic itabirite (table 35) as did andradite garnet in a former dolomitic itabirite (table 20) in the Santa Luzia quadrangle. The metasomatism was between silica- or carbonate-rich layers and the iron oxide-rich layers. There was probably no introduction of metallic elements, and these rocks should be considered as closed systems.
Chromian-bearing chlorite and muscovite is associated with gold-bearing sulfides in the basal Moeda Formation and in the Eio das Velhas Series (table 7). Chromian chlorite has been described by Tolbert (1964, p. 786) from the Kaposas and Morro "Velho 1 mines, Nova Lima quadrangle, where Cr ranges respectively from 0.072 to 0.580 percent and from 0.022 to 0.31 percent; fuchsite from the Raposas mine averages 0.5 percent Cr. Gair (1962, p. 12) found that fuchsite was generally less than 0.1 mm in diameter and comprised from minor amounts to more than 15 percent of some quartz-rich sericite phyllites. The association or close proximity of fuchsite-bearing rocks and gold mineralization suggests that Cr was mobile and was introduced into these rocks during metasomatism. In late solutions derived by igneous differentiation, Cr is mobile, probably as Cr-complexes (King-wood, 1955), much more mobile than the sulfides and gold which crystallized only in veins but percolated into the country rock where it was easily fixed by the high-K low-Na sericite and high-Fe chlorite.
Throughout the Quadrilatero Ferrifero, silica metasomatism is common in quartz-rich rocks in and near fault zones. This may be due to migration of Si cations into the fault zones, which became loci of low pressure after movement ceased as in the Alegria district (Maxwell, 1972) (fig. 42).
METASOMATISM BY NONMETALLIC ELEMENTS
Boron, fluorine, and OH tend to be concentrated in solutions derived from differentiated granites and are generally considered to be important agents of metasomatism. Metasomatism involving B and F is generally acknowledged to be of magmatic origin. The common formation of tourmaline near granitic intru-

SUMMARY METAMORPHIC HISTORY

Isotopic age determinations of samples from the Quadrilatero Ferrifero suggest four events at 2,300 m.y., 1,000 m.y. and 500 m.y. (Herz, 1970, table 2, fig. 4). The Eio das Velhas Series and gneisses from the Bagao Complex are older than 2,300 m.y. The Minas Series is younger than that and older than 1,350 m.y., the age of intrusion of the Borrachudos granite. The Itacolomi Series is tentatively considered older than 1,000 m.y. and may also predate the 1,350 m.y. event. The 500 m.y. event is based largely on Ar ages and is responsible for pegmatite formation in the Rio Piracicaba quadrangle. No large granite bodies of that age are known in the Quadrilatero Ferrifero.

EARLY PRECAMBRIAN METAMORPHISM

sions in this area and tourmaline pods in phyllites are prime examples of B metasomatism (see p. 48). The rarity of the Li-rich tourmaline elbaite suggests that tourmaline formed largely from cations present in the country rock and that the only significant contribution of metasomatic solutions was boron.
Topaz associated with euclase and large quartz crystals is indicative of fluorine metasomatism south of the Bagao Complex, in the Ouro Preto and Dom Bosco quadrangles in an east-west belt in the Cercadinho Formation (Gorceix, 1881). Fluorite occurs in calcareous rocks and is also associated with the sulfide mineralization in the Dom Bosco quadrangle (Johnson, 1962, p. 15). A "greisen" of quartz-muscovitetopaz in the Ouro Preto quadrangle indicates hightemperature replacement of country rock by F-bearing solutions (A. L. M. Barbosa, written commun., 1965).
Ultramafic rocks in the Quadrilatero Ferrifero commonly have undergone metasomatism by CO2-rich solutions. In the Itabira, Caete and Nova Lima quadrangles, magnesite and talc commonly have replaced ultramafic rocks.

The earliest Precambrian events apparently resulted in widespread, low-grade, regional metamorphism. Near igneous contacts bordering the Bagao Complex, and on the western slope of the Serra da Moeda, where the grade of metamorphism reached the almandineamphibolite facies, quartz-rich roof pendants or large xenoliths were converted to granitic gneisses and mafic volcanic rocks or graywackes were metamorphosed to granite amphibolite (Herz in Dorr and others, 1959/ 1961).
The original grade of regional metamorphism of the Rio das Velhas sediments is moot. Gair (1962, p. 52) found no evidence of retrograde metamorphism in phyllite and schist of the Nova Lima Group. Other workers in the area think that all bedding in the Rio das Velhas rocks is obliterated by a through-penetrating foliation or cleavage. Eugene Callaghan (oral commun.. 1960) found structural evidence of two metamorphisms in the same rocks'in the Morro Velho mine, each in the form of flow cleavages. Recrystallizatioii along each cleavage makes it probable that higher grade minerals would have been destroyed during the second cleavage development,
Most rocks of the Rio das Velhas Series are today at the lowest grade of metamorphism, the chlorite and biotite isograds of the greenschist facies. Typical assemblage is quartz-sericite-chlorite. Higher metamorphic facies are found in the Rio das Velhas Series around the Bagao Complex. In the Rio de Pedras quadrangle, biotite schist and associated amphibolites grade into granite in three steps (J. E. O'Rourke, written commun., 1954) : 1. Conversion of chlorite phyllite to biotite schist; ap-
pearance of biotite and plagioclase An28_36. 2. Gradation of biotite quartzites into granitic gneiss;

substitution of feldspar, largely plagioclase, for biotite, and abundant epidote. 3. Development of microcline gneiss. O'Rourke concludes that the main process involved was metasomatic metamorphism.
LATER PRECAMBRIAN METAMORPHISMS
The Minas Series and the Rio das Velhas Series are separated by an erosional unconformity. The first post-Minas orogeny took place about 1,350 m.y. ago. A thermal event occurred about 1,000 m.y. but its petrographic effects, if any, are impossible to distinguish from those of the 1,350 m.y. event. The regional metamorphism in the greenschist facies during the 1,000 and 1,350 m.y. events appear to be identical to the metamorphism of the earliest event at 2,300 m.y. The grade of metamorphism is higher in the eastern part of the region and also near igneous intrusions (pl.l).
PALEOZOIC AND YOUNGER EVENTS
The youngest radiometric date in the area is about 500 m.y. which has also been measured at Rio de Janeiro (Goldich and others, 1957), Rio Grande do Sttl (Herz and others, 1961), and between Recife and Sao Luis in northeastern Brazil (Almeida and others, 1968). This age is similar to the Caledonian and Taconic orogenies in Europe and North America respectively. In the Quadrilatero Ferrifero no largescale intrusion of granite took place at 500 m.y., but a thermal event at that time caused a loss of Ar in some micas.
Younger deformations also affected the area. Diabase dikes intruded northwest trending fractures north of the Serra do Caraga, and multiple basic dikes occupy faults in Maquine quartzites. Elsewhere in Brazil, diabase dikes have been dated at about 120 m.y. (Amaral and others, 1966).
In all probability then, the orogeny that was manifested elsewhere in Brazil by the widespread extrusion of basaltic flows and intrusion of diabasic and related dikes was also felt in the area of the Quadrilatero Ferrifero. The intrusion of these dikes was accompanied by normal faulting in a north-northwest direction seen throughout the entire region. The mafic dikes apparently follow only this late fault set and are unaffected by older pre-existing structures.
