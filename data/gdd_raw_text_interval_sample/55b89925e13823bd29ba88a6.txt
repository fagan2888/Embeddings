ABSTRACT
A reconnaissance investigation for uraniumbearing carbonaceous materials was made in three major areas of southern Utah: Kaiparowits Plateau, Henry Mountains, and Kolob Terrace. No uranium deposits of economic interest were found. A few 1to 2-foot beds of carbonaceous shale in the Dakota(?) sandstone contain 0. 006-0. 007 percent uranium. Other carbonaceous sediments that were examined contain 0.002 percent or less uranium.
INTRODUCTION
During the summer of 1953 a reconnaissance investigation was made in parts of southern Utah in search of new deposits of uranium-bearing carbonaceous rocks. Coal and carbonaceous shale of Cretaceous age were systematically sampled in three major areas: Kaiparowits Plateau, Henry Mountains, and Kolob Terrace (fig. 1). Eighty samples were submitted for uranium analyses and radioactivity measurements. They included 53 samples of coal, 10 of carbonaceous shale, 10 of volcanic rock, 2 of sandstone, 4 of water, and 1 of evaporite. The radioactivity measurements and chemical analyses of the samples are given in the table.

The samples are not appreciably radioactive nor do they contain uranium in amounts of economic importance. The only rocks with a uranium content that could be considered above normal for their type of lithology were a few thin beds of carbonaceous shale.
Field radioactivity measurements indicated a higher equivalent uranium content than was determined by the laboratory analyses. This may be due to the contamination from fallout, which was very heavy in southern Utah during the entire period of investigation. Background readings with the field Geiger and scintillation counters were so high at some localities in the Kolob Terrace that the instruments could be used only in mines or freshly dug pits.
Purpose and scope
This reconnaissance was undertaken in an attempt to locate deposits of uranium-bearing carbonaceous materials, especially coal, that might be used as byproduct sources of uranium.
The areas in southern Utah were chosen for study because they contain bedrock favorable for concentration of uranium and are overlain in part by volcanic and

tuffaceous beds that might be a source of uranium. Coal having as much as 0.1 percent uranium in the ash content was found during similar reconnaissance in South Dakota, North Dakota, Wyoming, Colorado, New Mexico, Nevada, Idaho, and Montana (Denson and others, written communication, 1952).

Acknowledgments
The writer was assisted in the field by Don M, George. The reconnaissance in western Kane County, Utah, was greatly facilitated by W. B. Cashion. Radioactivity measurements and uranium analyses were made by the Geological Survey laboratories in Denver and Washington. The work was done on behalf of the Division of Raw Materials of the U. S. Atomic Energy Commission.

AREAS EXAMINED

Kaiparowits Plateau

The Kaiparowits Plateau is located in Garfield and Kane Counties, south-central Utah. Escalante, the principal town in the area, located near the northeastern corner of the Plateau, canbe reached from Utah State Highway 54 by way of Tropic. (Seefig. 2.) The plateau area covers about 1, 500 square miles, much of which is accessible
only on foot or horseback. The nearest railhead is Marysvale, about 85 miles by road to the northwest of Escalante.

The plateau is composed of Jurassic and Cretaceous rocks thathave beenpreserved from erosion because they lie in a shallow syncline that is capped by resistant sandstone (Gregory and Moore, 1931, p. 134).

[Modified from Gregory and Moore(1931,p. 36)and from Gregory(1951,p. 23)]

Tertiary: Wasatch formation.

Unconformity.

Cretaceous: Kaiparowits formation-

Bluish-drab fine-grained to medium-coarse-grained arkosic sandstone and sandy shale.

Wahweap sandstone-

Yellowish-gray massive sandstone with some sandy shale. Forms conspicuous cliffs.

Straight Cliffs sandstone- Yellowish-gray to brown irregularly bedded medium to massive sandstone. Contains coal "beds. Forms conspicuous escarpment.

Tropic formation-

Bluish-drab argillaceous to sandy shale. Fossil-
iferous sandstone at base contains Gryphaea newberryi.

Dakota(?) sandstoneUnconformity.

Yellow to nearly white sandstone, conglomeratic in part. Irregularly bedded. Contains thin beds of coal.

Jurassic: Morrison formation or Winsor formation.

Carbonaceous rocks that contain more than 0. 002 percent uranium were found only at two localities, one on the northwest flank of the East Kaibab monocline (locality 28, fig. 2), and the other near Collet Creek on the northeast edge of the Kaiparowits Plateau (locality 20, fig. 2). The uranium content at these localities is 0. 006 to 0. 007 percent, and the uranium occurs in beds of carbonaceous shale 1 to 2 feet thick in the Dakota(?) sandstone. The carbonaceous shale at locality 28 is 2 feet thick and lies 15 feet above the unconformity between the Dakota(?) sandstone and the Winsor formation.
Other localities where carbonaceous rocks contain as much as 0. 002 percent equivalent uranium were locality 14, in natural coal ash in the Dakota(?) sandstone; locality 24, in carbonaceous shale of the Dakota( ?) sandstone; and locality 29, in carbonaceous shale of the Straight Cliffs sandstone. (See fig. 2.)
Samples of carbonaceous material from localities 9, 16, 21, 25, and 27 (fig. 2) contained 0.001 percent equivalent uranium.
A bed of ferruginous sandstone in the Dakota( ?) sandstone at locality 11 contains 0. 002 percent equivalent uranium and 0. 0017 percent uranium. A 2-foot bed of bentonite at locality 31 near Cannonville at the base of the Dakota(?) sandstone contains 0.001 percent equivalent uranium and 0. 0007 percent uranium. (See fig. 2.)
Several samples of volcanic flow rocks of Tertiary age collected on the nearby Aquarius Plateau show relatively high contents of equivalent uranium. A porphyritic flow rock at locality 3 at the head of Coyote Creek near Antimony contains 0. 0054 percent equivalent uranium and 0.0009 percent uranium. Another sample, . from locality 5 on Escalante Mountain, contains 0. 006 percent equivalent uranium and 0. 001 percenturanium. A third sample, from locality 4 near Cyclone Lake, contains 0.003 percent equivalent uranium but only 0. 0005 percent uranium. (See fig. 2.)
A field radiometric survey was made of some beds of limestone in the Wasatch formation along the edge of the Aquarius Plateau (fig. 2), but no radioactivity anomalies were found.
Samples from the other localities examined in the Kaiparowits Plateau area contain less than 0.001 percent equivalent uranium. (See table, p. 7.)
Henry Mountains
The Henry Mountains area is located in Wayne and Garfield Counties, southeastern Utah. Reconnaissance work was restricted to the northern part of the Henry Mountains from the west flank of Mount Ellen northward to the boundary between Emery and Wayne Counties (fig. 1). The town of Hanksville is located near the northeastern corner of the area. Green River, Utah, the nearest railhead, is 60 miles to the northeast on Utah State Highway 24.
The geologic map (fig. 3) was taken from the northern part of a map by Hunt and others (1952).

It shows localities that were examined and sampled during one week of reconnaissance work. Coal beds in the Henry Mountains area occur in the Dakota sandstone, the upper part of the Ferron sandstone member of the Mancos shale, and the upper part of the Emery sandstone member of the Mancos. Additional information on the geology of the area is given by Hunt (1946) and Hunt and others (1954).
The carbonaceous material examined contained less than 0. 002 percent equivalent uranium. Carbonaceous clay shale in the Ferron sandstone member at locality 36 (fig. 3) near Caineville indicated an estimated 0. 01 percent equivalent-uranium content after careful field Geiger counter readings, but laboratory analyses showed only 0.002 percent equivalent uranium.
Abed of coal 8 inches thick in the Ferron sandstone member at locality 35 contains 0. 001 percent equivalent uranium. This bed, like the one at locality 36, indicated a higher equivalent-uranium content in the field than in the laboratory. It is at about the same stratigraphic position as the bed at the Factory Butte coal mine (locality 33, fig. 3). The coal at the mine is 7 feet thick but contains less thanO. 001 percent equivalent uranium.
All of the coal beds examined in the Emery sandstone member contain less than 0. 001 percent equivalent uranium. (See table, p. 7.) These beds occur only in the deepest part of the Henry Mountains structural basin west of Mount Ellen and Mount Pennell (Hunt and others, 1954).
Kolob Terrace area
The Kolob Terrace area is located in parts of Kane, Washington, Garfield, and Iron Counties in southwestern Utah (fig. 1). Cedar City, near the northwest corner of the area, is the main railhead. Numerous secondary country roads give access to most of the region, but deep, narrow canyons tributary to Virgin River make traversing difficult.
The Kolob Terrace, a bench cut on the south flank of the Markagunt Plateau, extends from Coal Creek Canyon near Cedar City southward and southeastward to the vicinity of Glendale, Utah (fig. 4) lyingbetween the Hurricane fault on the west and the Sevier fault on the east (Gregory, 1950a, p. 5-6). The terrace ranges in altitude from 8, 000 to 9, 000 feet and consists of rounded hills, swales, and gentle slopes. Recent volcanic cones and lava flows lie on the surface at many places (Gregory, 1950b, p. 134-136).
The main coal beds in this area occur in the Upper Cretaceous Tropic formation (Gregory, 1950b, p. 146). Some layers of carbonaceous rock also occur in the Dakota( ?) sandstone and in the Straight Cliffs sandstone of Cretaceous age.
Beroni and others (1953) describe an occurrence of uranium in the lower part of the Dakota sandstone and upper part of the Summerville formation at the Bullock claims in T. 40 S., R. 9W., Kane County, Utah. Fragments of carbonized wood and clay that occur in a conglomeratic sandstone were found to contain finely disseminated uranium compounds. This zone, near the CretaceousJurassic contact, was examined at many places during the reconnaissance, but no radioactivity was detected.

The only sample collected in the area that contains more than 0.001 percent uranium is coal ash on the waste dump of the Southern Utah Power Company plant near Cedar City, Utah (locality 60, fig. 4). The ash contains 0.004 percent equivalent uranium and 0. 002 percent uranium. The ash came from three nearby mines in the Tropic formation; about 100 tons of coal, averaging about 12 percent ash, are mined in a day. One of these mines (the Webster, locality 55, in Right Hand Canyon) penetrates a 6-foot coal bed. The radioactivity detected in the mine was twice background, but samples collected from the mine contain only 0. 001 percent equivalent uranium or less.Samples of coal from the other mines (localities 54 and 57, fig. 4) contain less than 0. 001 percent equivalent uranium.
Near New Harmony, Utah, at locality 61 (fig. 4) a 1 -foot bed of semianthracite coal in the Tropic formation lies adjacent to an intrusion of andesite (Richardson, 1909, p. 384) and contains 0. 004 percent equivalent uranium and 0. 0012 percent uranium. The andesite contains 0. 003 percent equivalent uranium but only 0. 0003 percent uranium.
A 6-inch bed of carbonaceous shale (locality 52, fig. 4) in the Tropic formation near Pryor Peak on Kolob Terrace contains 0. 003 percent equivalent uranium but only 0. 0003 percent uranium.
Samples of coal at localities 43, 44, 46, 51, 55, 56, and 58 (fig. 4 and table) contain 0.001 percent equivalent uranium.
A rhyolitic lava at the top of the Brian Head formation of Miocene(?) age (Gregory, 1950b, p. 26) was sampled on Markagunt Plateau to determine whether uranium might be present in volcanic rocks on the plateau. The sample contains 0. 003 percent equivalent uranium and 0. 001 percent uranium.
