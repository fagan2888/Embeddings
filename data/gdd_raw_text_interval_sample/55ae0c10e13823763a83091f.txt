Preliminary report on the geology and mineralogy of clays /
on the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation, South Dakota by L. G. Schultz Summary
Clays suitable for pottery, brick, tile, and semirefractories are present in certain zones of rocks on the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation.
Mlner&logical analyses vere made of about 100 samples representing the principal rock formations on the Reservation, and usability tests vere made on 16 of these samples.
Light-colored clay, sandy clay, and sandstone of Tertiary age form the badland areas and underlie the upland areas of Pine Ridge. Older dark-gray shale and calcareous (calcite-bearing) rocks of Cretaceous age are present in the north and vest parts of the Reservation. These Tertiary rocks njad most parts of the Cretaceous rocks contain either too much cvelling clay, or in some cases, too much calcite or sand for ceramic purposes. Svelling clays cause excessive shrinkage and cracking during drying. Fev, if any of these eveiling cleyB, hovever, are of sufficient purity to make them valuable as drilling muds or for other common coarercial uses of such clays.
A weathered zone averaging about 15 feet thick vas formed on the older dark-gray shale (the Pierre shale) and, in the southvest part of the Reservation, also on calcareous rocks (the Biobrara formation) before the younger (Tertiary) sand and clay beds vere deposited.

Shis weathering changed the composition of the older rocks, making soiae of them acre usable for ceramic purposes. She general areas of outcrop of the weathered soae are shown in the geologic map by the line of contact between the rocks of Cretaceous and Tertiary age.
Effect of weathering on the Cretaceous rocks was variable. In general, calcite was leached and kaolinite was formed. Effects of the weathering are nost pronounced on the calcareous rocks in the southwest corner of the Reservation. Xn a few places, enough kaolinite has developed in the upper several feet of the weathered zone, for the clay to be semirefractory and suitable for chimney brick and flue tile. More commonly, the clay is less refractory and suitable for pottery and heavy clay products like brick and tile.
In the weathered zone developed on the dark-gray shale, generally too nuch, swelling clay is present for ceraaic uses. Much of this clay can be made usable by addition of 10-20 percent of sand or prefired grog to reduce shrinkage. Supply of such clay is enonaous and should be sufficient for the most ambitious development.
Soue areas of potentially usable clay on the Reservation are indicated in the report, liany other deposits of usable clay in the weathered zone undoubtedly are present, but were not visited or saopled during this reconnaissance study. It should be emphasized that clay in the weathered zone is highly variable. Iberefore, further sailing and testing to outline the lateral extent of usable clay deposits must precede any large-scale mining development. Before additional sanjpling and testing is undertaken, econooic factors such as markets, fuel costs, and transportation of products such as brick and tile with low value/ weight ratio should be evaluated.

Preliminary report on the geology and mineralogy of clays

on the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation, South Dakota »
by L* G. Schultz

Introduction

The following report vas prepared ty the U. S. Geological Survey

at the request of the Bureau of Indian Affairs. The report is based

on two weeks fieldwork, four veeks laboratory work, and on the results

of usability tests made by the Bureau of Mines.

v/

The investigation vas a reconnaissance survey of types of clay

present in all the major geologic units on the Reservation, and their

economic potential. General geologic data indicated that certain

zones of the Chadron and Brule formations contained clays similar to

those utilized elsewhere anl that clay in the Brule formation already

was being used in small aaounts for souvenir pottery.

Weathered zones developed below the White River group and

possible paleosoils within the group appear to merit special attention,

because soil-forming processes may have changed the normal mineralogy

of the rocks.

In this report, some data are given in more detail than may

presently be needed so that, if clay resources are developed further,

all information will be available to those carrying out the development.

Potential usability of materials will be discussed with only cursory

reference to minability and other economic factors, because thickness

of beds at localities sampled for this report probably are not maxl mum

thicknesses present on the Reservation, and because economic factors such as usrkets and availability of cheap fuel for burning brick and tile may change.
Bie -writer gratefully acknowledges the help of Professor John C« dark of the South Dakota School of Mines uho helped familiarize the writer vith the stratigraphic sequence on the Pine Ridge Ind1 an Reservation.
Geology Previous vork !fc>st of the geologic work on the Reservation has consisted of detailed and generalized descriptions of stratigraphic sections, mostly in connection vith paleontologies! vork in the White River badlands (O'Harra, 1920; Sinclair, 1921; Ward, 1922; Wanless, 1922, 1923; Wood and Mannhardt, 1925; Clark, 1927, 195^; Buci>, 1956; Idacdonald, 1955 ) No detailed geologic maps of most of the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation have been made. Studies by R. J. Dunham (19&.) "which include a small part of the Reservation souiihvsst of Pine Ridge were most helpful. Data from detailed mapping Just north of the Reservation near Sheep Mountain Table by Moore and Levish (1955) and Kepferle-/
J Kepferle, R. C., 195^f 2he geology of a portion of the White River badlands, Pennington County, South Dakota: South Dakota School of Mines, unpublished master's thesis.
may be extrapolated into the Reservation. F*^r laost of the Reservation,

the state geologic zaeps (Darton, 1951; Petsch, 1953) provide the only

available information.

Two types of maps have been used to determine saiqple localities

and place names used in this report: (l) in areas near the White

River., f^-ndjaaxte topographic cruadrangle maps of the U. S. Geological

Survey; (2) else\&ere, 1:250,000 Martin and Hot Springs sheets of the

AniQr Map Service.

Sedimentary rocks

.

Sedinentary rocks of Late Cretaceous and Tertiary age make up

the bedrock on the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation (table l). Die gray

shales and calcareous rocks of Late Cretaceous age are a.n. marine;

they have about the same appearance throughout the Reservation. The

Tertiary rocks are all terrestrial and are coogposed of variable layers

fron a fev to several tens of feet thick \&ich differ in sand-silt-clay,

ratios, color, carbonate content, and resistance to veathering.

Generally, the more sandy rocks of Tertiary age have lighter colors,

are inore calcareous, and form steeper slopes on outcrops than do the

nore clayey rocks.

The sedimentary rocks generally dip very gently to the south and

southeast, so Cretaceous rocks represented by the upper part of the

pierre shale are exposed mainly in the north, and progressively younger

Tertiary rocks are exposed to the soutii and east (see geologic map,

fig. la). In an area southvest of piiic RLdge older Qpper Cretaceous

rocks, infOufMng the Sharon Sfprings meaiber of the Pierre shale, the

Hiobrara formation, and the Carlile shale, are brought to the surface

by folding and faulting.

2he Ogallala formation, "which occurs only in isolated outcrops, is not shown on the map in figure la.
"Eocene(?) veathered zone" A remarkable feature of the stratigraphic sequence on the Pine Ridge Reservation and adjacent areas is the "Eocene(?) veathered zone" developed in most places below the White River group. It is composed of mottled rocks commonly 10 to 30 feet thick, but is as much as 70 feet thick near the town of Interior. Saese rocks -sere called the Interior formation by Ward (1922 and 1926) and were interpreted as a normal stratigraphic unit equivalent to the Fox Hills sandstone which overlies the Pierre shale. Wanless (1923, p. 197) shoved that "the surface of the Interior formation (of Ward) seens to have been essentially a peneplain" and "it (the Interior formation) vas foxsaed rather by weathering and leaching on the surface during a long period of pre-Hiite River erosion . . . M . Dunham (1961) has shown that southwest of Pine Ridge, this same weathered zone is developed on the Iliobrara and older formations; Dunham. calls this veathered zone "residual soil and veathered rock of Eocene(?) age". Oliis pre-White River weathered zone will be called the "Eocene(?) weathered zone" in this report in order to distinguish it from other possible ve&thered zones within the White River group. U3ae "Eocene(?) weathered zone" is composed mainly of mottled red, yellow, ligLt gray, and purple clay which weathers to a yellow slope. Bedding of the original shale is generally perceptible. If the underlying, unaltered rock is calcareous, the veathereu. zone may or may not be calcareous; at many places the calcite is leached from the upper part

"but not fron. the lower part. In such outcrops, the color of the lover part commonly is predominantly yellow vith seme gray mottling.
In some outcrops the veathered rocks described above are overlain by several feet of more intensely weathered rock vith sllckensides and no bedding. 3his tapper part of the veathered zone ccEsaoaly is also mottled, but it veathers to a color vhlch contrasts vith the yellov of the thick, lover part. In some places, as at locality 1, it veathers to a near vhite or pale lavender. At other places, notably around the town of Interior, it veathers to a red band. 23his upper part is never calcareous. It vac sacpled separately from the rest of the veathered zone and is also separated on figure Ib.
Sampling find testing Geological Survey Sacg>les vere collected in I4ay I960. During the fieldwork it became apparent that the clay currently being used for pottery in Pine Ridge vas from the "Eocene(?) veathered zone" instead of the Brule formation as previously reported; sampling of this veathered zone vas therefore emphasized. Also, most of the Tertiary sedimentary rocks appeared to contain either too much svelling clay, too much calcite, or too much sand for c*e.»~anic use; therefore, these units vere sampled only enough to give them adequate representation in the overall study. Some of the samples vere caJLeeted outside the Reservation because similar rocks vithin the Reservation could not be reached during the fieldvork.

Descriptions of the saaiples and the sample localities are given in the section "Description of sample localities" beginning on page 19.
Mineralogical analyses (fig. Ib) were made using X-ray diffraction techniques in May and June I960* On the basis of these analyses, 16 saraples were selected for usability tests. The selection vas made on a twofold basis: (l) samples most likely to be of economic importance; (2) a couiplete representation of rock types present on the Reservation even if some appeared not to be of potential economic importance.
Bureau of Mines Usability tests vere performed by the Bureau of Mines at Horris, Term., under the supervision of Mr. H. P. Hamlin. Complete tests of the raw working properties and firing properties were made on 10 samples and preliminary tests were made on the remaining 6 samples. Test bricks and pottery were made from the more promising samples. Some of the samples were mixed with sand and with each other for testing. Gfae test results are included in the Bureau of Mines report of usability tests, pages bj-^Q, and some of these results are grouped together on table 2 of this report.
Sample numbers Different systems of sample numbering were used by the writer and by the Bureau of Mines. In the writer's field numbers, the first digit is the locality number, the second digit is the sample number. For example , sample 6-3 is sample number 3 from locality number 6. For ceramic testing, the Bureau of Mines assigned letters from A to P to the 16 submitted samples.

In this report , the field numbers will be used. Letter designations of the Bureau of Mines are used only in the Bureau*s report and in table 2 i&ich summarizes the test data.
Mineralogy Mineralogical coniposition of the sazqples is sumarized in figure Ib Each rectangular bar represents one of the 109 analyzed san^les, the number at the lower left comer of "the rectangle is the sarnple number, and the number at the top of a column of rectangles is the locality number. .Approximate geographic locations of most of the saiaple localities are sboim on the geologic map; approximate stratigraphic position is indicated on the left side of figure Ib. Within each rectangle, each mineral is indicated by a pattern; the abundance of the mineral estimated to the nearest 5 percent is indicated by the vidth of the pattern. Minerals estimated to be present in anounts of only 1-2 percent are indicated by letters to the right of the rectangle. OSaickness of the beds represented by each of the sangptes froa the "Eocene(?) weathered zone" is indicated to the left of each rectangle (fig. Ib). Thicknesses are not given for other samples \.tiich appear to have no economic potential. Principal components of most of the samples are quartz,kaolinite, illite, montaorillonite, and zaixed-layer clay. Kaolinite is the major coqponent of many refractories and of fine ceramic vare. Illite is a principal constituent of nany heavy clay products, such as brick and
8

sever tile. Illitic clays also probably could be used for red-burning pottery. Koivbaorilloxiite is characterized ty its ability to adsorb water and by its high plasticity. Shrinkage in drying eliminates highly nontraorillonitic clays as a possible raw material for ceramic purposes, but some very pure laontmorillonite clays are ccmaercially used as drilling ends, decolorizing agents, and for other purposes. Mixed-layer clay like that in the rocks of the Pine Ridge Reservation has no present commercial use.
"£ocene(?) weathered zone" on the Ifiobrara formation
Unveathered sanrples frcn the lliobrara formation commonly contain 10-15 percent kaolinite, 15-20 percent 1111 te, 15-20 percent mixedlayer clay, 20 percent fine quartz, 25 percent calcite, and gm»n amounts of chlorite and feldspar. During development of the r'Eocene(?) weathered zone" the calcite vas ifirst leached and chlorite was destroyed vith little change in the ratio of the othe/'r minerals. After «-*n the calcite was leached, kaolinite was formed, mainly at the expense of illite. Progressive increase of kaolinite upward in the weathered zone is particularly notable at localities 1 and 3, where in the nonbedded clay at the top, kaolinite cosmoses half of the rock.
"Eocene(?) weathered zone" on the pierre shale Ihe Pierre shale is commonly composed of iiaall amounts of kaolinite and chlorite, 10-15 percent illite, ^0-60 percent of montnoriHonite and mixed-layer clay in highly variable proportions, 20-25 percent quartz, and small amounts of feluspar. 2he Sharon

Springs member generally is slightly more kaolinitic than other mezabers of the Pierre. Bius, Pierre shale generally tends to be more laontaorl ILoaitic than the Eiobrara.
Alteration due to weathering in the MEocene(?) veathered zone" is generally less pronounced on the Pierre than on the Uiobrara. As on the Niobrara, both chlorite and most feldspar was destroyed by the weathering, but on the Pierre the increase in kaolinite is only slight. In several outcrops of the "Eocene(?) veathered zone" developed on the Pierre, raontnoriHoaiite increases slightly upvard in the profile, thereby making the Pierre shale even nore different from the Niobrara.
Chadron fonaation
de dominant clays of the Ch^iron are montnsorillonite and mixedlayer clay. This composition accounts for the frothy appearance produced by swelling clays on the surface of its outcrops. Most samples also contain minor amounts of illite, and in the lover part of the Chadron, also a little kaoliiiite. Ihe kaolinite may represent weathered shale of Cretaceous a^e ti-ansported fraa nearby high areas before the area vas coznpletely buried by Tertiary deposits. Such an interpretation is in keeping with the smaller acKxints of feldspar contained in the kaolinitic deposits of the lover part of the Chadron than in the rest of the Tertiary roc&s.
2ie large amounts of montnori. lonitic clay together vifch cristobalite in tvo of the sai^ples (l4-5 end l8-l) suggest that altered volcanics comprise much of the fonuation. Detrital quartz
1C

is abundant only in the sandy rocks (samples 1-6, 15-4 > 15-5 > l6-l, 23-3, 23-4, and 24-3).
Brule formation Clays of the Brule, like those of the Chadron, are mostly moatmorillonitic. Differences in -weathering characteristics of the Brule and Chadron are probably caused by several factors. Most important, the Brule is more indurated by calcite. Greater abundance of illite probably indicates a larger amount of nonvolcanic cocgponents in the Brule, and abundance of glass in the poleslide meiober (Burg?, 195&) of the Brule indicates that all volcanic coesponents present have not been completely altered. Furthermore, a significant proportion of the volcanics apparently altered to zeolite (clinoptilolite) rather than montraorilloiiitic clay.
Possible veathered zones vithin the Brule formation possible veathered zones within the Brule formation have been described by several investigators. A dark band in the Brule formation vh.ich was in-terpreted by Kepferle-/ as a possible soil zone
J Ekesis, 1954; see footnote, p. 2.
is represented by sanrples 17A-11 and sample 20-3* A light bond in the Brule at Toadstool Park (locality 5 of this report) called the "bench" and interpreted lyy Schultz, Tanner, aai Harvey (1955) CUB a calicJie soil zone is represented by saaple 5-2.
11

Hone of these samples from the possible soil zones differ significantly in mineralogy from the adjacent rocks which have presumably not been affected by soil-forming processes. Tne mineralogies1 evidence does not favor soil development as an explanation for these light and dark color bands. In any case, their mireralogy does not differ significantly from the adjacent rocks, so they are of no more or less interest for economic purposes than the adjacent rock.
Arikaree formation The mineralogical composition of the Arikaree formation is very similar to that of the u^per part of Brule. Like the Brule, the Ariy.is.ree probably was derived mainly freer: partly altered volcanlcs. The thick white ash bed at the base of the formation probably represents a period of unusually intense volcanic activity.
Ogallala formation Much of the Ogallaia formation is composed of detrital quart?.. In the finer-grained parts of the unit, the clays are similar to those in lower Tertiary unite, indicating that volcanic debris vas still coming into the area. Similarity of the clays and prevalence of plagioclase feldspar in all the Tertiary units studied indicates that the chemical composition of the volcanics probably did not vary much throughout middle Tertiary time.
Usability Clay
Ceramics Of the rocks present on the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation, those most usable for ceramic purposes have a mineralogical composition of
12

about 1/3 icaolinite, 1/3 quartz, 1/6 illite, and 1/6 total montmorlllonite plus mixed-layer clay (may be higher if montmorillonite is subordinate to mixed-layer clay). Physical properties of such a ceramically usable clay are: water of plasticity below 30-35 percent; smooth and plastic working; a total drying and firing shrinkage in the range of 10-15 percent with no cracking; firing to a hard, dense body with low porosity at 2000-2100 aF without bloating.
The "ideal" mineralogical mixture probably could accommodate more illite, but such clays were not common on the Reservation. Too much kaolinite in a sample raises the required firing temperature and fuel costs. Too much montmorillonitic clay increases the water of plasticity,
/ causes excessive drying and firing shrinkage, and usually causes cracking. Quartz will reduce shrinkage problems, but too much quartz (over 50 percent) gives a porous, punkey fired body.
The only rock unit tested which meets these standards comes from the "Eocene(?) weathered zone" developed on the Riobrara formation. The 3-foot clay bed now being used in Pine Ridge is apparently equivalent to sample 1-3 and similar clays can be found in the area west of Pine Ridgerfor example, sample 3-2. Some samples at the top of the weathered zone for example, 1-5 and 3-3 contain so much kaolinite that they are too refractory for pottery or brick clay and require firing to a higher
"4.
temperature than desirable. Such highly kaolinitic clay, however, accounts for only a small proportion of the clays _»f the "Eocene(?) weathered zone." Ceramic properties of such refra-tory clay can be improved by mixing with more montnorillor.itic cla;. *, thereby improving
13 .

the workability and lowering the required firing temperature. A

mixture of sample 1-5 ' nd 26-1 is mentioned in the report of the Bureau

of Mines as an excellent clay for pottery. From a geographic viewpoint,

a mixture of samples 1-5 and 1-2 vould be more practical, as the samples

are from the same locality.

According to the Bureau of Mines, samples with large amounts of

calcite, like sasple 2-k should be avoided, so usable clays in the

"Eocenef?) weathered zone" on the Kiobrara are confined to the upper

part where calcite has been leached. Calcite is easily detected,

because it effervesces vigourously when doused by a 10 percent solution

of hydrochloric acid (obtainable as muratic acid in drug stores).

Most other clays on the ^Reservation are unsuitable for ceramic use

because they contain too much montmorillonite. A highly montmorillonitic

composition, together with abundant calcite and bloating tendencies

prohibits use of clays from the Tertiary formations and, without addi-

tives, most of the"Eocene(T) weathered zone" on the Pierre shale as well.

Addition of fine sand

Some of the clays in the "Eocene(?) weathered zone" on the Pierre

shale are usable for ceramics if sand or some other nonhydroscoplc

material is added to reduce shrinkage and improve the drying charac-

teristics. Addition of quartz sand will not make highly montmorillonitic

samples like 13-2 usable, but will make usable the relatively low
4
montmorillonite samples, such as sample 26-1. This sample, mixed with

20 percent fine sand, is an excellent pottery clay (table 2). Such

materials are widespread in the f'Eocene(?j weathered zone" in areas

shown on figure la, near the contact of the White River group and the

Pierre formation.

Ik

A preliminary estimate of the montmorillonite content nay be made from the weathering characteristics of the outcrops. Highly montzaorillonltic clay weathers to a frothy, loose slope; less montmorillonitic clays weather to a smoother and harder surface. In many outcrops of the "Eocene(?J weathered zone" on the Pierre shale, the lower part of the weathered zone appears more usable than the upper part. Final evaluation of individual outcrops, however, must be made by laboratory testing.
Some of the fine, white sand beds which occur locally at the base of the Chadron formation may be suitable for mixing with clay to reduce shrinkage. Material like sample 2k -3> which contains about two-thirds quartz and one-third predominantly kaolinitic clay should be ideal. Other possible sources of sand for mixing are: (l) sand dunes observed east of Sheep Mountain Table and probably present elsewhere on the Reservation; (2) sand bars along the major streams; (3) sandy tuff beds in the base of the Arikaree formation composed largely of glass and zeolite (samples l?-7> 19-1, 19-2); (k) addition of grog. Grog commonly is made by grinding defective fired ware.
Refractories The most kaolinitic parts of the "Eocene(?) weathered zone" (samples 1-5 and possibly 3-3) are usable for low-duty refractory brick. Such brick is suitable for fireplace linings, and brings a price about four times that of ordinary brick. Saople 1-5 is apparently the same ae sample SD-5 collected by Mr. Van Sant (written communication, 1960) of the Bureau cf Mines;

SD-5 has a PCE (pyrouetric cone equivalent) of 20. thicloiess of this refractory clay varies from 3 to 6 feet. Such thicknesses should "be suitable for strip mining \there the overburden is thin.
Lightweight aggregates Severa»l of the more nyantBoriHonitic sacaples tested by the Bureau of Mines exhibited bloating properties, and the more promising sanjples vere tested for lightvsigfrt aggregates. None bloated sufficiently for commercial use. Hone of the unveathered Upper Cretaceous rocks -which are used else^iere for lighttreight aggregate vere tested. 33ierefore, possible occurrence of bloating clays on the Reservation cannot be excluded by the limited tests made for this study.
Oil bleaching Some nontaorl 13onitic clays are used to decolorize oils, Sacple 18-1 (l) vas tested for this purpose, but it vas found to be unsuitable, Bentonite beds similar to those once used from Ardmore, £ Dak., for bleaching clays are present in the Sharon Springs member of the Pierre shale on the Beservation (locality 6, for exasg>le). Hovever, as the bentonite bed at Ardaore is no longer cocsaercially competitive, the similar clays on the Kecervation presumably also are not.
Drilling muds Some sodium montaori 1 lonite clays are valuable as drilling muds. However, none of the clays from the Reservation appeared to varrant testing for this purpose; first, because calcium rather than sodium
16

laontiaorl 1.1 on 1,teg are dominant, and second, because the nontmorillonite is not of sufficient purity for a drilling mud. Kepferle-' has tested
J (Biesis, 195> p« 37* see footnote, p. 2.
ri11r*n1tic clays from the Chadron formation as drilling muds and found them unsuitable.
Zeolites Zeolites are used extensively as "water softeners and in industrial cheaical processes. Soce of the rocfc on the Reservation for example, ea^ple 19-2 coatained about 30 percent of a zeolite called clinoptilolite. According to available information, however, «n coamercial zeolites currently in use are synthetic, and natural deposits are of no present value.
Conclusions Ceramics appear to be the main use for uhich the clay deposits of the pine Ridge Indian Reservation are suited. Clays suitable for ceramics, vithout addition of sand to improve drying characteristics, are confined to parts of the noncalcareous part of the "Eocene(?) veathered zone" t&ere developed on the Kiobrara formation; such clays occur only vest of Pine Ridge in the southvest corner of the Reservation, Characteristics of even these clays can be isiproved by addition of 10 to 20 percent sand or grog. At present, only about 3 feet of clay from the middle of the "fiocei e(?) -weathered zone" at locality 1 arc used for pottery. Most, if no! all, of the l4-foot thickness of thif^ MEocene(?) leathered
17

zone" could be utilized if the unused upper and lover parts of the zone are mixed vith the middle part. Ebe mixture vould have about the same composition as the middle part alone.
Some of the clays in the upper part of the ft£ocene(?) veathered zone" are suitable for lov-grade refractory brick for local use. Locality 1 might be a suitable mining site, and localities vith thicknesses of refractory clay greater than 3 feet probably can be found by detailed work. Consideration should be given to local demand for lov-grade refractory brick and other economic factors before such vork is undertaken.
Large amounts of clay vith fairly lov montmorillonite content are available in the "Eocene(?) veathered zone" developed on the 'Pierre shale in many areas of the Reservation. With addition of about 20 percent fine sand or grog, this clay vould be suitable for brick, tile, and pottery. If anticipated demand, fuel and transportation costs, and other economic factors seem favorable to a considerable eroDancion of the manufacture of clay products, detailed geologic mapping, probably accompanied tjy some form of drilling and testing program, vould be necessary to select potential mining sites.

23he above shrinkages indicate that 20§£ sand vill decrease shrinkage approximately 5/» vithout changing the vitrification tens>erature appreciably.
gie Use of BaCQa to Control Soluble Salts
In most cases, the soluble sulphates of K Ka Ca Mg and Pe are responsible for sciznsdng* From the test results of these clays, the addition of sand constituted a better control for the scumming than did the Barium carbonate, and this indicates that the scuming is due to Ha and K sulphates (alkali) because BaCO^ does not react vith the atMi sulphates in the solid state. (See the fired specimens of saiaple B vith 20$ sand)
With the exception of D, the saqples that show scranming must have the . sand addition before they can be utilized, thus, scunsaing does not constitute too serious a problem. Further evidence that the sand vill control the scumming is shovn by the miniature bride.
Saaples B/ C> and D vere mixed vith vater containing 10£ of barium carbonate. The scumming tendencies vere not reduced by the barium carbonate .

Discussion of Pottery gssts
CSie vitriiying temperature of this clay is too high for average pottery. It could be used vith same of the other clays to increase the vitrifying range, improve the drying characteristics, and decrease the firing shrinkage. It wuld probably zaake acceptable pottery if it vas blended vith feldspar or nepheline cyenite.
Good for red burning pottery, vitrification tenperature is rather short. Additions of potters flint or fine sand iciprove the properties of the clay.
!Caifl clay would not be suitable for pottery unless fine sand or potters flint is used because of the poor drying characteristics end the short vitrification range. It isakes excellent red burning pottery vith the added silica.
See F. She properties of this clay in pottery are sizailar to F, and vhile the sample vould probably make pottery without the addition of silica, silica improves its vorking and firing characteristics.
II vas blended iriLtii A to decrease (hi£h calciua content) the vitrifytenperature . 2ie vitrification teo^erature was decreased, but the ware
heavy scuisains. 'IMS blend vould be unsatisfactory for pottery, unless sosae method were developed to control remaining.
This vsa the best clay blend tested. Die .vitrification range is long, and the overall voriLLUg characteristics vere very good.
