ABSTRACT In late summer of 1986, eight U.S. and Canadian academic and government groups deployed 137 seismometers and land geophone arrays at 86 locations in and around the upper Great Lakes to passively record airgun shots fired as part of a deep-penetration marine multichannel seismic reflection program of the Great Lakes International Multidisciplinary Program on Crustal Evolution (GLIMPCE). Vertical components were recorded in all locations; horizontal components were recorded in 43 locations. The primary objective of recording the refracted, wide-angle reflected, and fan arrivals was to provide information on crustal velocity structure to supplement images recorded on the eight deep-penetration marine reflection profiles (five in Lake Superior, one in Lake Michigan, and two in Lake Huron). One of the Lake Superior lines was reshot to optimize recording of the large offset data. This report gives a data summary of the field operations related to the large-offset data.

INTRODUCTION
The Great Lakes International Multidisciplinary Program on Crustal Evolution (GLIMPCE), comprises United States and Canadian government, academic and industry geoscientists interested in the evolution of the midcontinent region of North America. GLIMPCE was formed in late 1985 to direct and coordinate future research around the Great Lakes. The first major experiment (August-September, 1986) was funded by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) and the Geological Survey of Canada (GSC) and utilized a large marine seismic airgun source for simultaneous acquisition of nine normal-incidence multichannel reflection and wide-angle reflection/refraction profiles in Lakes Superior, Michigan, and Huron (fig. 1). Passive recording of large offset information from all lines was done by eight academic and government groups. Together, the multichannel reflection data and the wide-angle reflection/refraction data provide an impressive and unprecedented data set for studying the deep crust and velocity structure of the midcontinent region.
This report describes the details of the field operations in which the large-offset reflection/refraction data were collected. Details of the nearvertical deep-penetration multichannel reflection profiles are included where relevant to the acquisition of the wide-angle data. A summary of the acquisition and processing parameters used for the contract multichannel seismic survey is given in Lee and others (1988) and Milkereit and others (1988). No effort is made to judge data quality or present interpretations.
EXPERIMENT OVERVIEW
Objectives: This first major seismic experiment was designed to investigate the tectonic framework and regional velocity structure of the crust in the Great Lakes region. Specific targets were the midcontinental geophysical anomaly, the Keweenawan rift, the Grenville Front, the Penokean and Huronian fold belts, and the Hemlo and Michipicoten greenstone belts.
Summary; The experiment is most easily divided into two parts: a normal incidence, deep-penetration multichannel reflection survey and a large-offset refraction/wide-angle reflection survey. The vertical reflection data comprise eight lines that were shot using a state-of-the-art marine multichannel acquisition system (lines A-C, F-I, fig. 1).
The large-offset data, consisting of wide-angle reflection, refraction and fan (i.e., off-line) arrivals, were recorded by seismometers located around the lakes during shooting of the eight offshore profiles. A ninth line was shot on equally spaced firing times and recorded by seismometers located within and around Lake Superior. This refraction line, Line A-refraction, essentially overlies line A-reflection, and is not plotted as a separate line on Figure 1.
In total, 1350 km of multichannel reflection data were collected; shots for the refraction profile covered an additional 214 km. Throughout the survey, large-offset data were recorded at 137 stations in 86 locations (table 1), including five ocean-bottom seismometers within Lake Superior and three multichannel arrays positioned around the lakes. Vertical components were recorded in all locations; horizontal components were recorded in 43 locations. Recording stations for individual lines ranged from 5 (line I) to 31 (line A-Refraction).

The research groups who provided instruments for acquisition of the large-offset data included two federal surveys (USGS and GSC), two Canadian universities (U. of Western Ontario and UÂ« of Saskatchewan), and four U.S. universities (U, of Wisconsin-Madison, U, of Wisconsin-Oshkosh, Southern Illinois U., and Northern Illinois U.). Additional personnel who participated in the field work were from U.S. Department of Energy, U.S. Coast Guard, Geological Survey of Ontario, University of Toronto, and University of Manitoba. Appendix I gives information about participants and instrumental details not covered elsewhere in the report.
MARINE SEISMIC SURVEY
All data were shot using M/V Fred J. Agnich, a seismic vessel operated by Geophoto Services, Ltd. (GSI, Calgary, Alberta). Five lines were shot in Lake Superior (lines A,B,C,F,G), one in Lake Michigan (line H) and two in Lake Huron (lines I, J). Line A in Lake Superior was also shot separately as a refraction line, utilizing the marine airgun array without the multichannel streamer array. Missing line numbers (D, E) have been reserved for speculation lines shot by GSI in Lake Superior that have not been purchased by GLIMPCE. Table 2 summarizes relevant statistical information about the marine lines. All digital navigation, shot instant, and bathymetry data as well as detailed reports from GSI are archived at GSC (Ottawa, Ont) and USGS (Denver, CO, and Woods Hole, MA).
Airgun Array: The source array (fig. 2) consisted of 76 guns, with 60 guns supplying the operating volume of 7780 inj (127.49L) and 16 guns providing spare volume of 2110 in (34.58L). Guns were strung on six linear subarrays, each 9.9 m long, with a total array width of 80 m. Gun sizes ranged from 80 in (1.31L) to 160 in (2.62 L). Operating pressure was maintained at 1900-2000 psi (12.8 - 13.8 MPa). Air gun synchronization was provided by GSI TIGER II controller. Array depths were 12 Â± 1 m in Lake Superior, and 6 Â± 1 m in Lakes Michigan and Huron. The shallower array depth was used because of shallow water in northern Lake Michigan and in the channel between Georgian Bay and Lake Huron.
Navigation; Primary navigation for all lines was by GEONAV, which utilized doppler sonar velocities to interpolate fixes between transitsatellite updates.
LORAN C provided secondary navigation and a Global Positioning System receiver provided backup (satellite) navigation. All navigation positions refer to the position of the transit satellite antenna, which was located 74 m in front of the center of the airgun array (fig. 2). Details of the navigation system are given in Appendix II.
Shot time determination; In order to utilize a common time base between the normal incidence reflection data acquired by the contract vessel and the large-offset reflection/refraction data acquired independently during shooting, all times were synchronized to the time of the eastern Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES). The shot instant was calculated by adding known internal system delays to the time recorded for the command to fire the guns which was always initiated on a whole second. System delays totalled .90796 s for reflection lines and 1.90796 s for line A-refraction, with additional delays of .31062 s for shots coinciding with the change of

tape of the DPS V acquisition computer, 24.5 s for all of line A-reflection, and 23.1 s for SP 970-1880 for line C. Determination of these delays is given in Appendix II.
Bathymetry: Digital bathymetry was acquired by a 38-kHz fathometer assuming a water velocity of 1470 m/s. This assumed velocity is valid for Lakes Michigan and Huron, where the average water temperature during the survey was 12Â°C (corresponding to a theoretical fresh water velocity of 1465 m/s). Because the colder water in Lake Superior would lower the velocity (5Â°C corresponds to a theoretical fresh water velocity of 1432 m/s), water depths there may be slightly overestimated. The fathometer was located 33.5 m in front of the ship's antenna, or 107.5 m in front of the center of the airgun array.
The original digital bathymetry provided by the contractor contained frequent gaps and noise of 10 to 50 m compared to the fathometer strip-chart profile. Final bathymetry was obtained (fig. 3) by (1) plotting the bathymetry at the same scale as the original fathometer strip-charts, (2) adjusting line segments that were reading a constant offset, (3) redigitizing those parts of lines that were either absent or missed the character of the bottom, and (4) applying a 3-point running average to smooth the noisy signal. Because no fathometer record was kept for line A-refraction (although digital bathymetry were recorded), this line was divided into 50-shot increments and smoothed and redigitized in accordance with its agreement to the relevant portions of line A-reflection. No 3-point running average was used for these relatively widely spaced shots.
The smoothed bathymetry is considered to be accurate to within 5 m of the depth given on the fathometer strip chart, and should be more than accurate enough for topographic corrections to the large-offset data.
Brief Chronology; The experiment began in Lake Superior with shooting of line A-refraction on 31 August - 1 September 1986. After five days of downtime to resolve a navigation problem, multichannel reflection acquisition began with line B on 6 September. Maintaining the ship's speed so as to fire the guns every 50 m (about every 23 s) while recording long records (every 20 s) and keeping the streamer from sinking in the fresh water of the lake proved to be impossible. The shot spacing was therefore adjusted from 50 m (30-fold data) to 62.5 m (24-fold data). The change between 50-m and 62.5-m shots on lines F (7-8 September) and A (9-10 September) reflects unsuccessful efforts to reballast the streamer for 50-m (30-fold) data. Line G was shot on 11 September. Line C was shot in 2 parts on 12-13 September because of poor weather conditions and on-board computer problems.
After a port stop in Sault Ste. Marie to exchange personnel, replenish supplies, and reconfigure the source and streamer arrays for shallow water, the reflection shooting resumed in Lake Michigan with line H (18-19 September). Parts of the streamer damaged in the ship's propeller during retrieval were replaced in transit between Lakes Michigan and Huron. The final lines collected were lines I (21 September) and J (22-23 September) in Lake Huron.

EXPERIMENTAL DETAILS
This section provides a line-by-line description of the large offset data, including a brief summary of the stations occupied, type of data recorded, and maximum offsets. (Appendix I gives additional instrumental details, a list of participants for each group that supplied field instruments, and archive information on the field data).
During the field work, coordination between the shooting ship and landbased groups was critical to the success of the operation. A.G. Green and C. Spencer (both with GSC, Ottawa) provided this support out of Sault Ste. Marie (Lake Superior lines) and Ottawa (Lakes Michigan and Huron lines).
Line A-Refraction; Line A-Refraction in Lake Superior was shot specifically as a refraction line along the same position as line Areflection. The primary objective of this line was to determine the velocity structure of the crust and upper mantle across the Keweenaw rift where earlier refraction studies yielded crustal thicknesses in excess of 50 km (Halls, 1982). Figure 4 shows shot and receiver locations, table 3 lists relevant information about the receiving stations.
This line was shot by time, rather than by distance, so that receiving seismographs could be synchronized to record discrete shots. The airgun array was fired every two minutes for a total of 640 shots, which averaged about 333 m apart. This shot spacing was chosen so that, at the longest ranges, arrivals from previous shots would not overlap.
A total of 31 stations recorded data along this line (fig. 4). Although no multichannel streamer array was towed from the ship, three multichannel geophone arrays were positioned on land: WISCORP south of the line, CH in the Keweenaw Peninsula, and AA north of the line. Five four-component oceanbottom seismometers (A8, A2, C4, C9, C3 of USGS) were spaced along the line within the lake. Seven vertical component seismometers were located in a linear array north of the line (SUP1, SUP3-SUP8). Five 3-component seismometers (Cl, C2, C3, C4, C5, C6 of UW, Madison) and two verticalcomponent seismometers (2N, 5S) were located south of the lake. Three 3component seismometers were located slightly offline on the Keweenaw Peninsula
A special problem exists regarding the OBS locations. The initial locations were chosen based on LORAN C fixes of the Coast Guard vessel from which the instruments were deployed. These locations were incompatible with locations determined by arrival times of shots from the shooting ship (which used Satellite/Doppler sonar navigation). Hence, either the navigation of the deploying ship or the shooting ship or both was in error. OBS locations were calculated (as described in Appendix I) as though all of the error originated from the deploying ship. (This is reasonable because most commercial LORAN C units fail to include overland-propagation and secondary factor corrections to final latitude/longitude calculations). If, however, the error was in the navigation of the shooting ship, this implies that all ranges calculated for the onshore instruments may be biased. Relative range from shot to shot (and therefore observed apparent velocities) should not be significantly affected. This possible source of error would affect intercept times and may affect correlation of the large-offset data to the near-vertical data.

(CP1-CP3). Fan recordings were made at five locations: Michipicoten Island (A), Isle Royale (IR1, IR2), Brule River (Bl), Bayfield Peninsula (BF1) and Ontanagon (ON1).
For shots along the profile, maximum ranges recorded are 256 km (SP 109 to station SUPS) and 231 km (SP 748 to station C4).
Line A-Reflection: Line A-Reflection was shot in two parts with different shot spacings (50 m and 62.5 m) because of problems in balancing ship's speed against streamer buoyancy. The overlap begins at SP 2290, with SP 2290-2326 (50 m shots) overlapping with SP 2290-2320 (62.5 m shots). As with line A-Refraction, the primary objective of this line was to image the crust and upper mantle structure at the position of the thickest crust associated with the midcontinent rift. Because this line was also shot separately as a refraction profile, collection of large-offset data was not a high priority.
Fourteen stations recorded large offset data (fig. 5; table 4). Two stations (SUP2A, SUP7A) were occupied north of the lake to record data where instruments had failed during the recording of line A-refraction. Two 3component stations recorded data on the Keweenaw Peninsula and south of the line, respectively. Six stations recorded fan arrivals, including one 96channel geophone array (WISCORP).
Line B; Line B, along the northeast shore of Lake Superior (fig. 6), was shot with a 50-m shot interval over a distance of 98 km. The primary objective of this line was to profile the structure of a granite-greenstone belt along the edge of the Keweenaw rift. The offline recorders also received ray paths directly through and beneath the main part of the Keweenaw rift.
A total of 13 stations (fig. 6, table 5) recorded large offset information from shots fired on line B. No station was located exactly along the axis of the profile, although BB (a 48-channel geophone array north of the lake) and A (a vertical-component seismometer on Michipicoten Island) are reasonably close to the axis. The remaining 11 stations recorded fan arrivals on 3-component instruments.
Line C; Line C in Lake Superior, 109 km long, was shot in two parts because of shipboard computer malfunction. Both parts were shot with 62.5 m shots. The objective of this line was to image the structure of the western limb of the Keweenaw rift. Its location roughly coincides with a refraction line shot in 1967 (Luetgert and Meyer, 1982).
A total of 15 stations recorded data from shots on this line (fig. 7, table 6). One 96-channel geophone array was positioned south of the line (WISCORP). The remaining fourteen stations were 3-component instruments located northwest of the line (6 stations, B1-B6), south of the line (4 stations, ON1-ON4) and offline at Isle Royal (2 stations, IR1, IR2), Keeweenaw Peninsula (1 station, CP3) and Big Bay (1 station, C6). Maximum offsets recorded were 131 km (SP 156 to station ON3 and SP 1880 to station B3).
The overlap between the two parts of line C occurs between SP 741 and SP 771. A special timing problem occurred on the start of the second part of the line. At SP 741, the GSI clock was synchronized to the satellite clock

for shot instant determination. However, by SP 1057, the two clocks read 23.1 s apart. When the discrepancy occurred was not logged, and hence the exact shot instants for SP 741-1057 remains uncertain. The 23.1s correction has been applied to all shots after SP 970.
Line F; Line F, located in Lake Superior, was shot in 6 parts alternating between 50 m and 62.5 m shot intervals (see table 2), This variation reflects buoyancy problems with the streamer, A 2,2 km gap occurs between SP 455 and SP 457; and a major change in the orientation of the line occurs at SP 1579, The primary objective of this line was to image the eastern limb of the Keweenawan rift in a region of relative gravity low and two positive magnetic anomales.
Twelve stations (fig, 8, table 7) recorded data from line F. A verticalcomponent seismometer on Michipicoten Island (A, Fig. 8) is the closest instrument to the axis of the north-northeast segment of the line (SP 1011579); four three-component instruments (C6, ON1-3) and a 96-channel geophone array (WISCORP) are approximately along the axis of the east-north-east segment of the line (SP 1580-1843), The remaining six stations (CP3, IR1, IR2, B1-B3) are three component seismometers that recorded fan arrivals through and beneath the rift basin,
Line G: Line G, 54 km long in Lake Superior, was shot with 62,5-m shot intervals and is the shortest of all lines. It was positioned to give a line crossing with line A in the region where continental crust was assumed to be thickest.
Eight stations, all three-component seismometers deployed by University of Wisconsin-Madison, recorded fan shots for this line (figure 9, table 8). There were no stations positioned along the axis of the line.
Line H; Line H, the only line in Lake Michigan, was shot with 62,5-m shot intervals for a total length of 283 km. A major bend in the line occurs at SP 3565. The primary objective of this line was to image the structure of the Penokean fold belt buried beneath Paleozoic sediments of the Michigan Basin.
A total of 21 stations were deployed along Line H (figure 10, table 9). Seventeen stations, containing a combination of fifteen vertical-component instruments (MCla-MC5c) amd two 3-component instruments (MC6, MC7), were positioned north of the lake along the axis of the north-northeast trending segment of the line (SP 101-3565). The remaining four stations were verticalcomponent seismometers (IS, 2N, 3S, 5S) located northwest of the lake and slighly off the axis of the east-northeast trending segment of the line (SP 3565 - SP 4636). The maximum range recorded for this line was 256 km (SP 101 to station MC6),
Line I: Line I in Lake Huron, was a north-south line (108-km long) positioned so as to image the structure of Proterozic Huronian platform deposits exposed north of the lake but buried beneath the lake by Phanerozoic sediments. Shots were spaced 62.5 m apart.
Five stations were occupied during the shooting of line I (figure 11, table 10). One vertical component seismometer was positioned along the north

shore of the lake (IRON). A second vertical-component instrument (MAN) was located slightly offline on the western end of Manitoulin Island. The remaining three stations, all south of the line in Michigan, comprised 2 three-component seismometers (HE1, HE2) and a 24-channel geophone array (AL). The largest offsets recorded were 116 km (SP 102 to station IRON) and 118 km (SP 1823 to station HE2). No fan arrivals were recorded for this line.
Line J; Line J, located in Georgian Bay and Lake Huron, is the longest of all lines in the GLIMPCE experiment (323 km). All shots were fired at 62.5-m spacings. Several kinks occur where the vessel adjusted course to stay within the channel separating Georgian Bay and Lake Huron (SP 1800-2300). The primary objective of this line was to profile the Grenville front and the buried igneous terrane to the west.
Eighteen stations were occupied during the acquisition of this line (figure 11, table 10). Three vertical-component seismometers were positioned east of the line on the coast of Georgian Bay (stations C, D, E). A fourth vertical-component instrument was located on the Bruce Peninsula midway down the line (station B). The rest of the stations were located just west of the end of the line and consisted of one 24-channel geophone array (SH) and thirteen three-component seismometers, ten of which were in a linear array less than 2 km long. Maximum offsets for this line are 336 km (SP 101 to station Fll) and 346 km (SP 5264 to station D).
DISCUSSION AND SUMMARY
In order to insure consistency in data preparation and distribution, all participants agreed to use the same algorithm for range calculation to display and interpret the large offset data. This algorithm uses the geodetic inverse formula with geodesy by A. R. Clarke (1880) and is listed in Appendix III. Final data exchange format is a superset of SEG-Y, with header definitions for refraction data given in Appendix IV.
In summary, this first GLIMPCE experiment has provided an impressive amount of seismic information for studying crustal structure and tectonics of the mid-continent. Eight academic and government groups "piggybacked" on a major marine multichannel reflection survey and were able to record vertical and three-component data for all seismic lines shot in the Great Lakes. The success of this effort rests with the careful coordination between the shooting ship and the land-based groups. The experiment demonstrates that large offset information can be acquired simultaneously with deep crustal reflection profiling at a fairly modest expenditure of dollars, time and effort.

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
An experiment of this size and cost would not have been possible without the dedication and cooperation of numerous individuals. Bill Cannon of USGS and Alan Green of GSC provided the driving force behind the organization of GLIMPCE and the 1986 seismic experiment and were instrumental in securing the USGS and GSC funding that made the experiment possible. Alan Green, with help from Carl Spencer, also impressively coordinated efficient communications between the shooting ship and the often remotly located field parties deploying seismometers and geophone arrays. J.C. Behrendt (USGS) and L.D. McGinnis (U.S.-DOE) were GLIMPCE representatives aboard M/V Fred J. Agnich during the Lake Superior lines; A.G. Green (GSC) and D.R. Hutchinson (USGS) were on-board representatives during the Lake Michigan and Lake Huron lines. We thank John Clink (GSI) and the captain and crew of the Fred J. Agnich for their cooperation during the contracting and shooting. We thank the Captain and crew of the U.S. Coast Guard vessel Katmai Bay for their cooperation during deployment and recovery of the OBS's in Lake Superior, and the Geological Survey of Ontario for helicopter logistics into Michipicoten Island. Much of the field logistics would not have been possible without the dedicaton of the many researchers, technicians, and students who operated the field instrumentation, most who are listed in Appendix I. Finally, we thank K. Ruffin, M.C. Mons-Wengler, E. Winget, P. Forrestel, J. Zwinakis and D. Blackwood for technical assistance in preparing the manuscript and J. Luetgert and W. Agena for critical reviews.

Comment: - Instruments C3, C4, C9: no hydrophone data. - Instrument A8: recorded only far ranges. - Locations for A2, C3, C4, C9 calculated by water wave inversion technique, as described below. - Location for A8 taken as the LORAN C position calculated by ranging to the instruments from USCG Katmai Bay. - Horizontal components recorded for only a portion of the line because of data storage limitations.

Note on Instrument locatons:

Instrument locations in field were determined by acoustically ranging to the OBS on the lake floor from 4-6 surface locatons and inverting the traveltimes thus obtained (Creager and Dorman, 1982). Ranges calculated from these locations were not consistent with the positions of the closest shots plotted on the record sections, indicating that the navigation of the Coast Guard Ship (LORAN C) was incompatible with that of the shooting ship (Satellite and Doppler Sonar).

Instrument locatons for A2, C3, C4, and C9 were recalculated based on the locations of the shots provided by the shooting ship using water-wave inversion solutions, which invert the travel times of the water waves from the closest shots. Because the cross-over distance between the direct water-wave arrival and first refracted arrival occurred within 2-3 shots of the closest approach, locating the instruments with this technique required information on the near-surface sediment velocity in the vicinity of the instrument. This velocity was not well known; however, varying the assumed velocity should yield a solution for both instrument position and velocity that gives minimum travel-time variance. This was not done because of program limitations and the probable poor resolution of the final result. The simplified water-wave inversion solutions were in good agreement with the plotted intersections of allowable range circle drawn for the three closest shots based on direct water wave arrival times and an assumed velocity of 1.45 km/s. The water-wave inversion technique also calculates water depths (given in Table 3) which were
essentially identical to those recorded on the ship's fathometer during OBS deployment.

48

Because the water-wave inversion technique utilizes the closest shots, none of which were recorded for instrument A-8, its location is based on inversion of travel-time ranging obtained on the Coast Guard ship

INTRODUCTION
A marine geophysical survey was conducted for the Geodetic Survey of Canada in conjunction with the United States Geological Survey between 1986 08 29 and 1986 09 23 In the Great Lakes. The M/V Fred J.. Agnich shot two lines of refraction data and 1343 km of reflection data in Lake Superior, Lake Huron and Lake Michigan.
Geonav was used as the navigation system to shoot the entire Great Lakes prospect. The integrated navigation was a configuration of a Magnavox 1107 TRANSIT satellite receiver, doppler sonar and a gyrocompass. An Internav 400 LORAN C receiver was available with additional velocity and position information and a TI4100 GPS receiver was on board for most of the survey as backup and an additional QC system and for updates to the LORAN C.
For the purposes of the GLIMPCE experiment some special modifications were made to the M/V Agnich's control/navigation system (CMS). These include interfacing to a GOES satellite receiver/chronometer, interfacing to a modified CMS chronometer and modifying the system coordinator to allow predetermined delays to be set into the recording sequence.
The CMS was synchronized to WWV time through the GOES satellite receiver and the CMS chronometer. After the initial passing of time to the CMS chronometer and simultaneous CMS start and WWV synchronization, the chronometer supplied the CMS with a 100 ms interrupt by which the CMS kept time. If the CMS chronometer missed its interrupt from the WWV chronometer the two would be out of synchronization and a LED indicated the error unless the CMS was stopped and restarted.
During the course of the project several problems affected the data collection. One serious problem was unexplained large satellite updates occurring with otherwise good navigation data. After completion of the first line on 09 01 several days were spent investigating all aspects of the satellite system and on 09 05 it was discovered that the update problems were a result of loading an erroneous antenna height into the
57

CMS (neglecting to account for 183 metre difference of Lake Superior to sea level). Another problem affecting the data was the time as recorded on tape was not in synchronization with the WWV satellite time. This was due to some delays not being accounted for and interruptions in the system.
The errors introduced by the above incidents were corrected. This report gives an explanation of the corrections and how they were applied.

AREA OF SURVEY

SUMMARY OF EVENTS DURING SURVEY
LAKE SUPERIOR
Line AA- was shot in time mode with an external chronometer synchronized to WWV satellite time for control. An external fire command was issued on every even two minute mark. Various stations were set along the shore to collect refraction data in a continuous mode as well as several buoys being placed the U.S.G.S. by the U.S. Coast Guard for collection of reflection data. Problems with large satellite updates began during the shooting of the line but as it was a one time effort (batteries in the buoys were good for about 24 hours) the production was continued. Line AA- was completed on 09 01. After several days of investigating all aspects of the satellite system, on 09 05 it was discovered that the update problems were a result of loading an erroneous antenna height into the system This incident is detailed later in this report.
The first chargeable shotpoint on line BB' was 111 and the line proceeded normally to the end with a 50 m shot spacing.
The end coordinates for BFLINK were the southerly coordinates off line BB' and the the northerly coordinates of FF' and the line was shot as a tie between the two. The shot interval was 50 m but the cable became uncontrollable and sank due to a change in water temperature. The line was terminated at shotpoint 456. The client representative on board the vessel approved a decision to increase the shotpoint interval to 62.5 m to allow an increase in vessel speed.
Line FF' was started with the 62.5 m shot interval and a speed of 4.3 kn until shotpoint 865 where the interval was reduced to 50 m and then increased to 62.5 m at shot 902 for the remainder of the line. A dogleg was executed at shotpoint 592.
F'F" was started at a 50 m interval and remained that way until shot 2096 where it was increased to 62.5 m for the remainder of the survey. Velocity information was from sonar and at times LORAN C due to loss of tracking in deep water (+365 m).
C 5= V 60

The 980B NAV computer was halted temporarily to replace a circuit board before the beginning of Line A'A. The system was restarted before the first chargeable shotpoint. The synchronization between the CMS and WWV time were lost because of this and the CMS time had a 24.5 s offset (slow) that remained until the end of A"A.
On line A"A the sonar velocities gave some problems due to a rising and falling water bottom.
Before commencing Line G'G the CMS/GOES timing system was resynchronized.
On Line CC' the compasses in the streamer began spiking and were unusable due to a very strong magnetic anomaly in the area. By shotpoint 356 the anomaly was sufficiently far enough away for the Streamer Tracking System (STS) to accept the compass data and they remained settled for the remainder of the line. There were time loss problems at the end of this line due to a loose connector for the 100 KHz signal thus affecting the count-up for the CMS 0.1 s clock interrupt and causing it to lose time. It was terminated for this reason and restarted at the last known good time.
Line CC'A was started with the CMS synchronized to WWV but a 23.1 s shift occurred was discovered to have occurred sometime after shotpoint 970.
LAKE MICHIGAN
The CMS was reinitialized with the new antenna height to include the elevation of Lake Michigan (176.5 m above sea level). Line 3 had a dogleg initiated at shotpoint 3556.
LAKE HURON
The elevation of Lake Huron (& Georgian Bay) is the same as Lake Michigan so the antenna heights remained unchanged. Line 1 was shot South to North through Mississagi Strait in Lake Huron. The beginning of the line was shot at a slower speed to avoid a barge. It was no longer obstructing the path by shot 166. The line was terminated 3.8 km from the prep lotted E.O.L. due to impending shallow water endangering the streamer.
61

Line 2A was shot from East to West from Georgian Bay into Lake Huron through the Main Channel via a series of dogleg segments. Deviations of up to 485 m to the north of the intended line had to be initiated through the channel to avoid rocks, ferry boats and shallow water. The doglegs were executed at shotpoints 1841, 2033 and 2487. At the second dogleg the vessel was steered off line to starboard to avoid a shallow water area. They were back on line at shot 2281 and performed another dogleg at shot 2487. The line terminated normally.
SATELLITE ANTENNA HEIGHT ERROR
It was discovered after completion of line AA- that the update problems were due to the wrong satellite antenna elevation being input into the CMS. Lake Superior is 183 m above mean sea level which was not originally accounted for during system initialization. The errors introduced by this omission are predictable and were corrected in post processing. The magnitude of shift introduced by the error in height initialization ranged from 42 to 392 m with the greatest movement in a longitudinal direction. The table below summarizes the corrections computed. Figure 2 gives a graphical representation of the situation and Figure 3 shows the magnitudes of the displacement (corrections) versus the satellite elevation angles.

The following is a list of the corrections applied to the individual satellite fixes on line AA- in the

The elevation (ELEV) of the satellite is the vertical angle from the horizon to the satellite and should be between 12 and 75 degrees to be acceptable.
The azimuth (AZ) of the. satellite is its direction from the vessel with respect to north.
The correction (CORR) is the absolute distance in metres that the particular fix must be adjusted by.
The correction in Northing (dN) and Easting (dE) is the computed value in metres to be added to the coordinates to compensate for the error in antenna height.

The firing sequence for all lines except the first (AA-) was accomplished with the DPS V in distance mode. The CMS issued the firing command to start the sequence. Additional circuitry to delay the start by 200 ms was added to avoid CMS shot-to-shot jitter of the start pulse (1 - 20 ms) . A delay off 0.65536 swas present to allow the DPS tape transports to ramp up to speed and write the header data. A wire blast was issued to the TIGER II which issued a time break (1.4 ms delay). There was a 51.2 ms delay from the issue of the field time break to the firing of the guns. There was a further 1.31072 second delay at the first shot after each DPS tape change due to the DPS taking longer writing Its ID burst to tape and detection of the wire blast missing the first normal "window" latch and catching the next rising clock cycle.
Line AA- was shot for refraction data in a time fired mode. The DPS V was fired on a two minute interval controlled by the time from the WWV satellite. To accomplish this additional circuitry was installed in the chronometer to synchronize it with the WWV clock to within 1 ms. The interval was set to fire on even two minute marks with the external start issued from this clock circuitry to the system coordinator which passed it to the CMS and immediately issued a start. All of the above mentioned delays were also present during this mode of shooting except that an additional 1 s delay was introduced into the time as recorded on the CMS (ex: 5m 59 s would be recorded on tape for a shot at 6 m 00 s) since it used presently latched time to store on tape (gets updated 50 - 150 ms later).
The navigation data were processed without due regard for the original field time and in cases of missed shotpoints and deletions of data anomalies the time was interpolated. Under reflection seismic processing circumstances this would not cause any problems but in the case of the refraction lines it is not acceptable. The time as recorded in the field was stripped from the CMS data and used for the final data.

The final navigation data with original CMS times were corrected to remove the effects of the delays and time offsets.
The following is a summary of the various system delay corrections (all are positive values) used for the final post processed Navigation Tape:

RECOMMENDATIONS
On any future jobs of this nature it is recommended that the time from the reference source (WWV satellite receiver in this project) be input from a parallel output into a display with an accuracy of milliseconds. In addition to this a similar output from the CMS clock should be sent to the same display and the time difference computed and displayed as well. These times should be recorded for every shotpoint (to 5 significant digits) in a spare or unused position on the CMS tape. An alarm associated with the display should be in place so that a defined limit could be set and any differences outside the chosen range would be flagged and the alarm tripped. A hardcopy of al1 times and differences should be recorded in the ADL printer output.
In addition to displaying both CMS start time and WWV clock time we should also log the true firing time of the airguns by using the sum shuttle pulse to load the clock time. This could be output to the line printer and stored to tape at the next (SP 4-1) shotpoint. We would always have to shoot 1 extra shot at the end of the line but this would be easy to do with existing CMS software. Every shot would have a three-way check (time) with all delays being known. This would also show any wire-blast to time break jitter which exists in the present TIGER II software if the TIGER II is not synchronized to a 1 millisecond interrupt.
As well as the proper recording and QC display of the timing there should be the opportunity to make corrections to the CMS recorded time for the known delays including those due to BOT headers at DPS tape changes so that the WWV and CMS time difference is zero. The proper time to be recorded on tape is the correct one (no changes or corrections in post processing). If an offset does occur due to a system idle or a loose connection and can't be corrected immediately, then the corrections will have to be made during the post process ing.

APPENDIX IV:
SEG-Y(LDS) EXCHANGE FORMAT
This appendix lists the FORTRAN code used for the exchange of all refraction and wide-angle data. This code is a series of FORTRAN EQUIVALENCE statements which define file and trace header information for programs used to read the data. This code was developed by C. Spencer and I. Asudeh at GSC for use with Lithoprobe refraction data.
The exchange format, called SEG-Y(LDS) (SEG: Society of Exploration Geophysicists; LDS: Lithoprobe data storage), is a superset of SEG-Y format. Whereas SEG-Y provides an industry standard for the exchange of seismicreflection data (Barry et al., 1975), SEG-Y(LDS) provides a suitable format for the storage and exchange of seismic refraction data. Any existing SEG-Y program is capable of reading the data. However, SEG-Y(LDS) goes beyond SEG-Y in three ways: (1) it utilizes unused portions of SEG-Y headers for informaton unique to refraction data; (2) it extends the definition to organization within a disk file; and (3) it allows (but does not require) that data be stored with word formats other than the IBM real and integer formats defined in the industry standard.
Header definition; SEG-Y(LDS) maintains the two part file organization of standard SEG-Y in which a file header (3600 bytes long) is followed by seismic trace data blocks, each containing a 240-byte trace header. The last 340 bytes of the file header and the last 60 bytes of the trace header, which were undefined in original SEG-Y standard, are used in SEG-Y(LDS) for information relative to refraction data, such as shot times. The main additions are allowing storage of (1) flexible shot, receiver and line names, (2) more shot and receiver information, (3) more data word formats, and (4) different seismic sttributes. Comments within the code clearly indicate which items are unique to SEG-Y(LDS).
Disk storage; SEG-Y(LDS) has been adapted to disk storage primarily by GSC. The SEG-Y file contains a number of traces, each trace containing a number of data samples. File organizaton, as on tapes, consists of a single line header followed by data blocks containing trace headers. The file is a series of bytes with no logical record structure, and the bytes are defined as for tapes. A file structure without logical record structure allows easy access by most machines (all files must have a machine dependent physical record length, but on most machines this can be transparent to the user). For instance, on the PC, the bytes may easily be read in the C-language. Using the IBM PROFORT compiler the file must be opened for direct access with a chosen record length, then data must be read into a buffer in chunks with that record length. Because most sophisticated processing needs direct access to a particular trace, it is convenient to pad out all traces to the same length (and a minimum of 3600 bytes). When this is done easy direct access to bytes from FORTRAN is possible. Other institutions and users of other languages may ignore this restriction.
Data word formats; SEG-Y defines four data word formats. The actual format used is indicated by the contents of bytes 25-26 in the line header. For SEG-Y(LDS) we have chosen a fifth format to be the gain-ranged LUNCHBOX format utilized by GSC, and a sixth format to be VAX FORTRAN R*4. Note that SEG-Y defines the byte organization within a 2-byte integer on a tape. This is opposite to that on the VAX and the P.C. Yet to be decided is which would
75

be the most sensible ordering on disk. Currently, GSC is using the natural way for the VAX and PC, i.e., least significant byte is the first in a two byte integer.
