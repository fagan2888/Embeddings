the rasa program represent systematic effort study number nation important aquifer system aggregate underlie much country represent important component nation total water supply 
general boundary study identify hydrologic extent system accordingly transcend political subdivision investigation often arbitrarily limit past 
the broad objective study assemble geologic hydrologic geochemical information analyze develop understanding system develop predictive capability contribute effective management system 
the use computer simulation important element rasa study develop understanding natural undisturbed hydrologic system change bring human activity provide mean predict regional effect future pumping stress 
the final interpretive result rasa program present series geological survey professional paper describe geology hydrology geochemistry regional aquifer system 
each study within rasa program assign single professional paper number volume interpretive material warrant separate topical chapter consider principal element investigation may publish

they postulate volcanic front relate igneous activity localize along southward propagate transverse break structural warp subducting plate

the lack pronounce change simulate water level transmissivities along lineament north transverse crustal boundary could due young normal fault disrupt lineament 
accordingly old lineament may leaky barrier ground water flow 
contrast igneous activity along transverse crustal boundary begin time normal faulting 
perhaps structure emplace intrusion along lineament disrupt structure along lineament still act barrier flow 
some structure might affect ground water flow could correlate simulated water level transmissivities 
general major thrust fault could correlate simulated estimate water level transmissivities scale model 
perhaps due masking feature due size model cell use simulation perhaps effect feature regional ground water flow minimal 
thrust fault might act barrier flow particularly vertical flow less permeable rock thrust permeable rock gouge along thrust alter clay 
however thrust fault could also increase transmissive property rock due fracture brittle rock particularly near center fold along margin thrust plate 
shear zone also could correlate simulated water level transmissivities

the walker belt fig

thus regional basis possible determine strike slip fault along walker belt act barrier flow restrict geologic feature 
the lack correlation simulate water level transmissivities strike slip fault could reflect model average water level transmissivities within cell 
steep drop across small distance mile could simulate model cell 
instead smoother gradient less severe change transmissivity simulate thus possibly mask local effect could relate series strike slip fault 
shear zone might act barrier flow also could act conduit along direction strike 
this possibility could simulate model anisotropy select cell could simulate without simulate anisotropy every cell model layer 
increase transmissivity direction strike along shear zone model cell could justify normal fault study area right angle shear zone could easily act conduit along strike
