our rnai analysis various time point reveal detailed involvement development beetle elytron 
rnai penultimate stage cause severe developmental defect elytra hindwings

hindwing last larval rnai cause vein patterning defect affect shape 
also perform rnai later last larval stage prepupal stage

therefore mid last larval stage pupation appear critical period novel function elytron shape regulation 
currently unknown elicits elytron speciﬁc shape function

forewing hindwing differentiation although essential elytron hindwing development shape function restrict elytra 
the molecular mechanism responsible elytron speciﬁc function yet examine 
simple explanation ubx hindwing selector gene speciﬁcally repress shape function without compromise function hindwings 
this repression could due direct bind ubx protein inhibit shape function selectively 
alternatively ubx could repress expression spatially temporally restricted manner would prevent complete repression hindwings 
drosophila ubx appear induce expression haltere homologous hindwings beetle instead repress pavlopoulos akam
