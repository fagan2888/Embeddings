magnetic interpretation assume magnetic anomaly generally cause igneous metamorphosed rock sedimentary rock essentially nonmagnetic 
the method use calculate depths magnetic source pattern technique describe vacquier other 
for large amplitude anomaly cover large area horizontal extent steep slope give good representation depth magnetic source steeper magnetic gradient closer magnetic rock surface for small amplitude anomaly distance half maximum value probable estimate maximum depth rapid oscillation field therefore indicate magnetic unit closer source smooth gentle anomaly 
there good correlation large amplitude steep gradient anomaly area map mesozoic volcanic rock 
this thick sequence volcanic rock invariably give rise anomaly compute surface 
this partial strong confirmation procedure depth computation utilized area 
where cenozoic volcanic rock directly overlie 
shaktolik group little magnetic expression magnetic profile fig

therefore anomaly large amplitude steep gradient occur cenozoic volcanic rock attribute mesozoic volcanic rock underneath veneer young cenozoic basalt flow 
most magnetic profile display strike magnetic contrast 
profile fig 
may consider typical 
northwest southeast end profile steep gradient high amplitude anomaly observe indicate magnetic rock near surface 
the central portion profile record rock shaktolik group smooth practically featureless indicate magnetic rock probably locate great depth 
the abrupt change character magnetic profile near northwest southeast end traverse interpreted represent contact mesozoic volcanic rock rock shaktolik group 
affords method outline extent sedimentary basin area cover cenozoic volcanic rock alluvium 
the abruptness change suggest either sedimentary rock wedge abruptly margin basin contact fault 
the contact deduce magnetic data show dashed line figure there general agreement location contact map surface contact infer aeromagnetic data locally however aeromagnetic contact displace basinward much mile
