the work petting poulton provide valuable insight land use mosaic southwestern united state 
some categorization barren land rangeland suggest researcher adopt land use land cover classification system 
land use and land cover classification system for use with remote sensor data 
design classification system for use with remote sense technique there one ideal classification land use land cover unlikely one could ever develop 
there different perspective classification process process tend subjective even objective numerical approach use 
there fact logical reason expect one detailed inventory adequate short time since land use land cover pattern change keep demand natural resource 
each classification make suit need user user satisfy inventory meet need 
attempt develop classification system use remote sense technique provide framework satisfy need majority user certain guideline criterion evaluation must first establish 
begin considerable diversity opinion constitutes land use although present use land one characteristic widely recognize significant planning management purpose 
one concept much merit land use refers man activity land directly relate land clawson stewart 
land cover hand describe vegetational artificial construction cover land surface burley the type land use land cover categorization develop classification system present report relate system classify land capability vulnerability certain management practice potential particular activity land value either intrinsic speculative 
concept concern lancf cover land use activity closely relate many case use interchangeably 
the purpose land use commonly associated type cover whether forest agricultural residential industrial 
remote sense image form device record activity directly 
the remote sensor acquire response base many characteristic land surface include natural artificial cover 
the interpreter use pattern tone texture shape site association derive information land use activity basically information land cover 
some activity man however cannot directly relate type land cover 
extensive recreational activity cover large tract land 
particularly amenable interpretation remote sensor data 
for example hunt common pervasive recreational use land hunt usually occur land would classify type forest range agricultural land either ground survey image interpretation 
consequently supplemental information need identify land use hunt 
supplemental information land ownership map also necessary determine use land park game refuges water conservation district may land us coincident administrative boundary usually discernable inventory use remote sensor data 
for reason type land use land cover identifiable primarily remote sensor data use basis organize classification system 
agency require detailed land use information may need employ supplemental data 
almost classification process rare find clearly define class one would like 
determine land cover would seem simple draw line land water one consider problem seasonally wet area tidal flat marshes various kind plant cover 
decision may seem arbitrary must make time description category complete guideline explain inventory process repeat 
the classification system must allow inclusion part area study also provide unit reference land use land cove type 
the problem inventory classify multiple us occur single parcel land easily solve 
multiple us may occur simultaneously instance agricultural land forest land use recreational activity hunt camping 
us may also occur alternately major reservoir provide flood control spring runoff generate power winter peak demand period 
this reservoir may sufficient water depth navigable commercial shipping year round may additionally provide summer recreational opportunity 
obviously activity would detectable single aerial photograph 
however interpreter occasionally relate floodcontrol activity drawdown easement around reservoir detectable imagery acquire winter low water level 
similarly major lock water control structure imply barge ship traffic foam tailrace indicate power generation 
pleasure boat marinas well wake 
classification criterion 
boat detect high altitude photograph 
although activity detectable time use remote sense many multiple use situation cannot interpret degree success 
the example reservoir provide insight another facet problem solution however possibility need acquire collateral data aid understanding multiple use situation 
the vertical arrangement many us actual ground surface provide additional problem land use interpreter 
coal mineral deposit croplands forest electrical transmission line cross pasture rag underground roof building subways beneath urban area exemplify situation must resolve individual user compiler land use data 
the size minimum area depict particular land use category depend partially scale resolution original remote sensor data data source land use identify interpreted 
also depend scale data compilation well final scale presentation land use information 
case land use cannot identify level accuracy approach size small unit mappable other specific land use identify small map 
farmstead example usually distinguish agricultural land use map generalize level classification 
hand farmstead may well interpretable small represent final format scale 
analogous situation may arise use category 
when map intend format presenting land use data difficult represent unit area small inch side 
addition small area cause legibility problem map reader 
user computer generate graphic similarly constrain minimum size computer printout 
classification criterion land use land cover classification system effectively employ orbital high altitude remote sensor data meet follow criterion anderson

the classification system suitable use remote sensor data obtain different time year 
effective use subcategories obtain ground survey use large scale enhance remote sensor data possible 
aggregation category must possible 
comparison future land use data possible 
multiple us land recognize possible 
some criterion apply land use land cover classification general criterion apply primarily land use land cover data interpret remote sensor data 
hop generalize first second level accuracy interpretation attain make land use land cover data comparable quality obtain way 
for land use land cover data need planning management purpose accuracy interpretation generalize first second level satisfactory interpreter make correct interpretation percent time 
for regulation land use activity tax assessment purpose example great accuracy usually require 
great accuracy generally attain much high cost 
the accuracy land use data obtain remote sensor source comparable acquire use enumeration technique 
for example post enumeration survey make bureau census reveal percent farm necessarily percent farmland enumerate census agriculture ingram prochaska 
addition perfect new interpretation technique procedure analysis various type image enhancement signature identification assume resolution capability various remote sense system also 
land use and land cover classification system for use with remote sensor data 
resolution resolve power image system refers ability separate two object distance apart 
land use application interested minimum size area recognize interpretable land use land cover type 
obviously minimum area depend type characteristic image system involve pragmatically also order generation imagery far study image remove number reproduction stag original record 
the user refer recent information available determine resolution parameter system 
the kind amount land use land cover information may obtain different sensor depend altitude resolution sensor 
there little likelihood one sensor system produce good data altitude 
would desirable evaluate source remote sense data application solely basis quality characteristic source 
however common practice transfer data base map matter guideline difficult use base map without extract additional data map 
topographic map road map detail city map generally contribute detail beyond capability remote sensor data

similarly several level category instance level iii category interpret landsat data 
presently though level category obtain accurately high altitude photograph 
much level iii level land use land cover data also obtain high altitude imagery 
this level categorization also present wide range scale 
however detailed level categorization use dependence necessarily must place high resolution remote sensor data supplemental ground survey 
the principal remote sensor source level data present time high altitude color infrared photography
