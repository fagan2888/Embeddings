among reliable source information geologists engineer send year geological survey conduct survey different part alaska acquire much accurate information regard mineral production region work also general information contact miner operator course travel field 
member government organization instance bureau mine bureau mint the alaska kailroad bureau foreign domestic commerce custom service course regular duty collect many data extremely valuable study use avoids unnecessary duplication collecting record 
most bank express company business organization alaska collect use data regard mineral commodity particular district

these schedule fill operator constitute authoritative record 
unfortunately however return operator even operator return specific data desire misunderstand inquiry reply manner answer may correctly interpret schedule edit

apparent however fact collect one source although strictly accurate likely compute state different basis equally reliable report receive another source considerable edit revision must 
minehal industry 
do bring one standard 
possible know exactly correction apply order reduce report production strictly uniform standard 
however though uncertainty necessarily remain believed significant effect result express report consistent within report series record statistic mineral production 
the restriction statistic report relate production stress reader realize statistic comparable among necessarily differ publish 
government bureau primarily record production whereas issue bureau mint instance relate receipt office bureau issue custom service relate shipment record station issue organization may compute still base 
the term production however rather indefinite may refer raw ore broken ledge metal content placer gravel sluice may apply late ptages intervene final product dispose usable form 
thus miner produce much ore mill man much concentrate smelter much metal 
vary degree purity refiner much pure metal 
between stage inevitable loss valuable metal contain material treat two stage amount produce 
the cost would far exceed value result geological survey attempt collect record quantity different mineral commodity produce several stage 
consequently necessary adopt stage seem represent one common determinable significant step 
for material consider stage true recoverable content valuable mineral closely determine material shape dispose basis 
word metal contain rock lose tailing would consider produce ore mine though mill smelt would credit metallic content could reasonably expect recover treatment 
unless obvious inconsistency individual report show quantity mineral produce accepted final 
much difference statement different source arises also various method compute value different mineral commodity 
standard practice 
mineral resource alaska volume base computation value average sell price year price actually receive individual producer 
obviously method computation dis regard amount receive individual mine believe afford useful representation industry whole 
thus report operator small placer mine sell gold discount local trade large producer may make deduction ship insurance expense incident handle product edit full value gold produce record 
because method compute value different commodity reason statistic necessarily differ greatly might collect tax similar purpose 
constant aim compiler make annual summary mineral production helpful accurate adequate possible 
the geological survey therefore bespeaks continued cooperation person concerned alaska mineral industry urge communicate information may lead desired end
