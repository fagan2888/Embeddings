neurobiology the eye within brain 
all vertebrate except mammal photoreceptors within brain however light sensitive cell never unambiguously identiﬁed 
new paper provide direct evidence photosensitivity cerebrospinal ﬂuid csf contact neuron quail brain mediate seasonal reproductive response 
michael menaker difﬁcult make cell especially nerve cell responsive visible light 
principle one couple light sensitive molecule ion channel machinery translate change membrane potential action potential already place 
natural selection accomplish many time long history life recent ability imitate feat less create excite new ﬁeld optogenetics 
somewhat surprising biologist find hard accept evidence direct photoreception vertebrate brain 
more year ago young karl von frisch later nobel laureate famed translator language be ernest scharrer train blind ﬁsh come surface water food response presentation light signal 
this lead discovery photosensitivity pineal gland associate structure ﬁsh later amphibian reptile 
nonetheless great skepticism reproductive endocrinologist greet work benoit 1930s show 
retrospect quite clearly blinded duck like sight brother could induce grow gonad exposure long day 
benoit work implicate hypothalamic photoreception view kind curiosity receive experimental attention deserve 
1960s publish several paper demonstrate surgically blind house sparrows synchronize entrained circadian activity rhythm light cycle also respond reproductively long day 
work several laboratory soon establish extra retinal non visual photoreception invariant feature sensory armametaria vertebrate class interest important exception mammal 
the parallel story mammal involve specialized non visual retinal photoreceptors neither rod cone also fascinate 
search photoreceptors mediate response bird reptile undertaken several group use two technique attempt identify opsin class protein usually associate photoreceptors brain 
immunocytochemistry ingenious use small radioluminous disc implant various region brain cause gonad growth 
these experiment identiﬁed brain region putative site photoreception figure suggest cerebrospinal ﬂuid csf contact neuron possible photoreceptive cell type 
likely skepticism discovery ﬁeld meet due part intensely visual sensory system part fact speciﬁc photoreceptors deep brain unambiguously identiﬁed 
new study yoshimura colleague report issue current biology provide direct neurophysiological evidence photoreception csf contact neuron brain quail link bird seasonal photoperiodic response 
the gold standard demonstration intrinsic photosensitivity neurophysiological record light response individual cell isolate possible photoreceptor input 
this technically demand especially putative photoreceptors small cell bury deep brain 
the author solve technical problem elegantly 
first hypothesize csf contact neuron paraventricular organ pvo intrinsically photoreceptive 
they previously show cell stain immunocytochemically antibody opn5 opsin

the parapineal similar pineal associate structure find ﬁsh amphibian reptile although pineal photoreceptive non mammalian vertebrate 
the iris intrinsically photoreceptive group well perhaps mammal 
the putative location non visual photoreceptors show yellow deep brain varies among non mammalian vertebrate 
the adult mammalian pineal photoreceptive although contains opsin 
the non visual photoreceptors mammal intrinsically photosensitive ganglion cell retina 
figure courtesy 
find non visual structure 
they make slice contain pvo brain newly hatch quail visualize csfcontacting neuron record use whole cell patch clamp 
they obtain clear membrane depolarization fast action potential response light vitro preparation 
the depolarization response persist action potential block add tetrodotoxin medium 
furthermore entire response light include fast action potential essentially unaffected synaptic input cell block cocktail contain antagonist major neurotransmitter 
this step demonstrate photosensitivity indeed intrinsic cell recording make arrive information photoreceptive cell via synapsis 
finally label record cell biocytin stain anti opn5 antibody conﬁrming csf contacting neuron 
recording make indeed contain opn5 
the result experiment provide clear proof csf contact neuron intrinsically photosensitive 
separate experiment use adult quail test whether opn5 mediate brain photoreception involve seasonal reproductive response long day 
quail keep short day pineal gland surgically remove eye cover leave deep brain photoreceptive area potentially affect light 
they divide bird two group inject opn5 sirna third ventricle brain one group experimental scramble opn5 sirna third ventricle group control 
one day later group expose long day brain collect end 
the experimental group control show two response third ventricle injection number csf contact neuron stain anti opn5 antibody signiﬁcantly 
reduce level tshb mrna reduce well 
thyroid stimulate hormone tsh normally induce long day early indicator important regulator seasonal reproductive response 
interpretation result experiment straightfoward 
injection sirna third ventricle likely affect csf contact neuron may other location outside pvo contain opn5 
thus cannot sure csf contact neuron pvo clearly show photoreceptive mediate response tshb long day 
ﬁrm connection photoreceptive opn5 contain csf contact neuron pvo reproductive response season important live many bird yet make 
work detail photoreceptive response long day likely complicate 
technically difﬁcult determine relative role photoreceptive structure several figure 
many different opsin find retina pineal gland deep brain 
non visual photoreception involve several partially overlap function circadian entrain pupillary constriction even mammal fear condition 
indeed widely present among vertebrate constitutes separate sensory modality distinct vision
