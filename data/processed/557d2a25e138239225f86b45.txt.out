hawaiian volcano observatory hvo establish thomas jaggar massachusetts institute technology operate continuously geological survey since 
the many year continuous observation kilauea mauna loa two world active volcano foster fundamental development instrumentation measurement technique increasingly use study active volcano world 
moreover early major advance seismic research hvo contribute significantly subsequent systematic investigation earthquake relate crustal process conduct part geological survey earthquake hazard program 
the volcanic plumbing reservoir system beneath kilauea picture schematically balloon bury thin layer sand plaster 
when magma feed reservoir analogous air fill balloon internal pressure increase sandplaster surface layer push upward outward order accommodate swell inflation 
the net effect inflation include steepen slope volcano surface increase horizontal vertical distance point surface place fracture sand plaster layer stretch beyond break point 
such rupturing material adjust magma movement pressure result earthquake 
shrink rapidly drain reservoir feed surface eruption analogous deflate popping balloon would produce opposite effect flatten 
slope reduction distance surface point decrease earthquake frequency 
change slope real volcano measure precisely various electronic mechanical tiltmeters field tilt survey technique example detect change slope kilometer long board raise thickness dime place one end 
similarly minute change horizontal distance measure instrument us laser beam tiny change vertical distance measure make series precise level survey 
such change easily detect precision part per million 
the notion one part per million dramatized term dry martini drop vermouth per gallon gin 
the frequency location magnitude earthquake generate magma movement easily accurately determine data hvo scientist make horizontal distance measurement geodimeter electronic laser beam instrument 
obtain properly design seismic network 
the hawaiian volcano observatory recently expand seismic network station record earthquake activity kilauea mauna loa round clock basis 
the continuous monitoring earthquake change volcano shape alone sufficient predict eruption however 
the proper analysis present day data require basic understand prehistoric eruptive record behavior volcano reconstruct regional geophysical geochemical geologic study use modern aged method 
such glimpse volcano prehistoric past 
critically important historic record extend short time permit make reliable prediction future behavior 
some case study investigation carry part usgs volcano hazard program provide case study monitor two world active best understood volcano mauna loa kilauea big island hawaii 
mauna loa volcano last erupt july 
time inactive quarter century since june eruption along southwest rift zone 
the first hint change lead eruption mark increase 
summit caldera pit crater mauna loa hawaii 
the inset show mauna loa appear hawaiian volcano observatory kilometer away 
number earthquake begin april year eruption 
inflation swell summit mauna loa detect month later annual laser beam remeasurement horizontal distance across summit crater 
the set measurement show first significant increase horizontal distance line across summit crater since inception precise distance monitoring program 
the hawaiian volcano observatory immediately alert hawaiian official general public possible reawaken mauna loa long slumber 
during next month ground deformation seismic network mauna loa expand 
record show number earthquake rate summit inflation increase steadily reach crescendo summit eruption begin july 
the exact timing eruption could predict even though premonitory indicator point toward eruption day 
although earthquake frequency taper sharply week follow july eruption swell summit resume indicating magma continue accumulate mauna loa summit reservoir 
measurement make six separate occasion period year half follow eruption confirm continued swelling 
from analysis write record past historic eruptive behavior fact earthquake swell extend along northeast rift observatory scientist suggest 
flank eruption northeast rift likely sometime summer mauna loa behave past year 
this conclusion convey member hawaiian congressional delegation hawaii civil defense official announce medium publish scientific journal 
newly observe change geodimeter line july however suggest maunael may depart previous behavior timetable predict eruption may revise 
inflation mauna loa volcano slow 
the northeast rift zone contract slightly little seismic significance recent month 
accord survey scientist volcano neither shrink deflating 
the magma accumulate summit region period year since april drain away 
thus potential eruption still much present 
the new data suggest however predict eruption may farther away time summer 
new forecast probable time eruption possible mauna loa swell earthquake resume analysis make change pattern eruptive behavior 
these recent development show relatively limited time span intensive monitoring year short historic record year simply inadequate establish statistically reliable probability exact time place next eruption even though mauna loa still prim action 
kilauea closely monitored long period time mauna loa necessary state knowledge prediction eruptive activity achieve 
there notable success however 
for example late early several eruption predict sufficient certainty hour advance hvo scientist could advise official hawaii volcano national park evacuate certain section 
the park ranger able clear park visitor safely actual outbreak area ample time 
but also false alarm premonitory indicator signal movement magma summit reservoir magma inject rift zone ground without break surface 
hvo scientist measure height lava fountain eruption kilauea volcano 
fall increase steam die forest near heiheiahulu kilauea low east rift zone north kalapana cause hvo staff member increase monitor area 
although significant change observe ascribed largely continued southward shift kilauea south flank follow effect devastate magnitude richter scale earthquake november 
since summer however change heiheiahulu area take place increase rate 
swell general area around heiheiahulu cone begin 
the area underwent uplift accompany additional southward horizontal movement suggest accumulation magma area without occurrence increase seismic kilauea typically accompany magma movement 
additional monitoring instrument instal even though hvo record date back show similar swelling occur without advent eruption 
because east rift zone kilauea long locale recur lava flow eruptive activity could pose threat downslope cultivate populated area 
hawaii county civil defense official advise unstable condition

intense earthquake flurry abrupt deflation begin hour 
the eruption continue intermittently next day along restricted part fissure 
episode vigorous fountain alternated interlude relative inactivity feeble spattering lava 
the final voluminous phase activity produce rapidly move lava flow pose potential threat village kalapana downslope 
unlike nearby village kapoho destroyed eruption kalapana spar 
the lava fountains stop october meter high flow front slowly ground halt meter nearest dwelling 
conclusion tremendous stride make recent year intensify monitoring mauna loa kilauea part volcano hazard program understanding typically nonexplosive hawaiian type volcanism increase markedly 
but reliable specific prediction capability eruption hawaii still elude scientist 
the predictive capability much poor explosive volcano cascade range northwestern united state mount rainy mount hood mount lassen alaska elsewhere around circum pacific ring fire
