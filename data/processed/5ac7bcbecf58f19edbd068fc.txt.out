these excite time interested plant evolution 
the ever increase supply molecular particularly sequence data provide new window plant relationship surprising result 
one thorny issue plant phylogeny address recently concern enigmatic gnetales one five extant lineage seed plant 
early 1900s gnetales consider close live relative flower plant angiosperm 
subsequently gnetales dissociate angiosperm often link conifer last decade link angiosperm group call anthophytes 
but molecular data obtain recently number group indicate gnetales associate conifer closely related angiosperm 
the five extant group seed plant angiosperms specie dominate terrestrial habitat conifer specie cycads specie ginkgos one specie gnetales specie belong three distinct group ephedra welwitschia gnetum 
the problem line relate one another closely relate angiosperm 
it solution complicate fact extant lineage radiate rapidly long ago seed plant appear late devonian million year ago least three five line probably split within late carboniferous million year ago 
despite common feature seed five living group separate great morphological gap 
some feature share two group pattern complicate conflict similarity must result convergent evolution 
the first suggestion gnetales relate angiosperm base several obvious morphological similarity vessel wood net vein leaf gnetum reproductive organ make simple unisexual flower like structure consider evolutionary precursor flower wind pollinate amentiferae other view reduce complex flower common ancestor angiosperm gnetales mesozoic bennettitales 
these idea go eclipse evidence simple flower really derive rather primitive feature amentiferae vessel arise independently angiosperm gnetales 
vessel angiosperm seem derive tracheid scalariform pit whereas gnetales resemble tracheid circular border pit conifer 
gnetales also like conifer lack scalariform pit primary xylem scale like strap shape leaf ephedra welwitschia 
some author also draw homology flower gnetales fertile short shoot paleozoic conifer transform woody cone scale later conifer 
begin mid 1980s numerical phylogenetic analysis morphological character offer hope solution conundrum 
all study though base different interpretation many key character indicate gnetales close live relative angiosperm 
some even nested angiosperm within gnetales closer welwitschia gnetum ephedra 
gnetales angiosperm bennettitales group clade name anthophytes highlight flower like reproductive structure 
year anthophyte hypothesis go heresy near dogma 
also fuel reinterpretation character evolution seed plant especially origin distinctive angiosperm feature carpel house ovules future seed double fertilization give rise embryo endosperm 
angiosperm nest within gnetales vessel net vein leaf simple flower gnetales angiosperm chloranthaceae homologous 
bennettitales fossil interpolate angiosperm gnetales similarity parallelisms feature unite two group obscure lignin composition tunica layer apical meristem granular pollen structure reduce megaspore wall 
the first molecular phylogenetic study seed plant review strongly support monophyly gnetales refute view give rise 
dispatch r107 
only analyse ribosomal dna link angiosperm gnetales low statistical support 
analysis chloroplast gene rbcl place gnetales base seed plant follow angiosperm arrangement support recent study photosystem gene sanderson personal communication 
study chloroplast internal transcribed spacer it sequence 18 rdna place angiosperm base seed plant link gnetales conifer 
these tree seriously contradict anthophyte hypothesis way rerooted angiosperm gnetales form clade 
the result early molecular study thus rather inconclusive give apparent disagreement among gene low level statistical support inconsistency fossil record still seem morphological inference angiosperm gnetales form clade could correct 
this picture change flood new multigene study provide much strong evidence gnetales relate angiosperm rather conifer 
rejection anthophyte hypothesis news possible example serious conflict molecule morphology 
some study however indicate gnetales originate within conifer addition four living non angiosperm seed plant group extant gymnosperm form clade none closely related angiosperm 
study long sequence chloroplast dna one gnetalian gnetum one conifer pinus three angiosperm cycads ginkgo include able address status extant gymnosperm 
support angiosperm monophyly strong becomes three taxon problem angiosperm gnetales conifer radiate central point figure 
the relationship among group depend entirely placement root tree root branch lead angiosperm infer hansen 
gnetales link conifer root conifer branch gnetales link angiosperm 
root tree include liverwort marchantia outgroup 
liverwort however diverge seed plant million year much sequence divergence could cause marchantia attach spuriously one long seed plant branch happen line angiosperm gnetum 
such long branch artifact difficult prove possibility investigate instance include analysis sequence closer outgroup fern another gnetalian preferably ephedra subdivide long branch gnetum

gene encode mad box proteins believe transcription 
the effect alternative rooting infer relationship gnetales angiosperm conifer 
factor role regulate development gnetalian group sample gnetum cycad ginkgo sequence include 
thirteen mad box gene gnetum analyze along gene angiosperm conifer fern 
four case gnetum gene link conifer angiosperm gene closer conifer gene 
two case might dismiss weak bootstrap value measure statistical support particular phylogenetic inference bootstrap value high case 
three even recent study potential long branch artifact reduce include cycad ginkgo conifer angiosperm two three genus gnetales 
these analysis add new mitochondrial sequence cox1 atp1 atpa matr small subunit rdna data rbcl nuclear 18 rdna one case chloroplast gene atpb 
those analysis include outgroups indicate extant gymnosperm form clade place gnetales within conifer directly link pinaceae figure gnepines hypothesis 
although seed plant rerooted extant gymnosperm paraphyletic way reroot gnetales angiosperm form clade 
these study provide best evidence yet anthophyte hypothesis favor connection gnetales conifer 
the strong result base mitochondrial gene conifer gnetales clade support high bootstrap value 
analysis rbcl nuclear rdna show weak support clade 
r108 current biology vol 
rdna data show fairly strong support monophyly conifer gnetales sister group 
furthermore conifer gnetales lose one copy invert repeat chloroplast genome 
worth consider whether incongruence among genome might mean gene tree genuinely different likely due lineage sort 
for example nuclear rdna tree conifer form monophyletic group reflect true specie tree mitochondrial gene tree might reflect retention one ancestral mitochondrial type gnetales pinaceae second type conifer 
this may seem farfetched could address measure data set heterogeneity analysis additional nuclear gene 
what conclude analysis 
the important believable result anthophyte hypothesis incorrect first emphasize gnetales closely related conifer angiosperm 
gnetales also link conifer analysis rpoc1 sequence unpublished analysis graham olmstead frohlich sanderson colleague personal communication 
less convinced extant gymnosperm form clade gnetales derive within conifer 
seed plant phylogeny obtain maximum likelihood analysis rbcl nuclear18s rdna mitochondrial small subunit rdna sequence 
the number associate branch bootstrap value parsimony analysis 
example obtain exclusion third codon position rbcl also case study photosystem gene sanderson personal communication 
and analyse individual gene yield tree compatible anthophytes seed plant rerooted 
nevertheless impressed fact virtually signal anthophytes seem exist data set certainly clade exists 
the worrisome point gnetales unusually long branch figure especially mitochondrial tree 
with regard conclusion extant gymnosperm monophyletic also seem strongly support mitochondrial data work need example use kishino hasegawa test determine strongly data reject rooting extant gymnosperm paraphyletic 
position root cycad ginkgo node might difficult detect branch short compare long branch angiosperm gnetales 
the novel conclusion gnetales nest within conifer troublesome reason 
the nuclear 
severe clash morphology molecule 
extent conflict may exaggerate 
much make agreement among morphological tree less attention paid level support anthophytes 
recent analysis bootstrap value part tree low 
nevertheless force angiosperm base extant seed plant link gnetales conifer add ten evolutionary step suggest conflict easily dismiss 
the morphological data conflict still tree place gnetales within conifer 
this arrangement would entail evolution loss gnetales several conifer feature resin canal tiered proembryos 
ironically would also eliminate prime morphological argument relationship two group similarity fertile short shoot paleozoic conifer flower gnetales modern conifer short shoot represent woody cone scale look nothing like flower 
contrary imply article morphological phylogenetic analysis use flower double fertilization character indicate vessel dicot like leaf arise independently angiosperm gnetales 
focus feature distract attention cryptic character unite two group 
need scrutiny especially eye toward understand might lead astray 
for example character megaspore wall air sac 
dispatch r109 
pollen involve reduction may produce similar result even occur independent line 
some morphological feature claim link angiosperm gnetales differ detail tunica consist two cell layer angiosperms one gnetales megaspore wall thin gnetales absent angiosperm 
seem reasonable code state potentially homologous might meet strict priori standard comparability 
this sort reassessment cathartic need understand morphological character much well apparently understand evolution seed plant 
live seed plant closely related angiosperm way reconstruct origin angiosperm fit fossils picture do analysis morphological character
