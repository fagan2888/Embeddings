ground water reconnaissance the western part the mojave desert california with particular respect the boron content well water stone summary and conclusion reconnaissance geochemical study ground water western part mojave desert indicate two area show possibility contain economic deposit borate 
these area determine abnormally high boron factor ground water compare boron factor water sample throughout area ground water analyze well 12n1 red rock canyon show boron concentration ppsi boron factor 
detailed geochemical prospecting would desirable large expose section tertiary rock red rock canyon area investigate source miner ground water 
analysis ground water well 20a1 17l1 mile east kramer borate deposit show boron concentration factor high ppm respectively 
colernanite report test hole drill area 
well 20a1 drill depth foot accurate log well available 
general boron concentration factor grind surface water throughout ithis part western mojave desert area less ppm respectively 
factor high consider significant factor area 
caution always use geochemical interpretation ground water guide location mineral deposit 
low concentration absence desire mineral constituent ground water necessarily indicate nonoccurrence mineral 
hydrologic condition mineral deposit affect appreciable degree chemical character water tap well 
for example kramer borate deposit srcall quantity ground water low boron concentration occur perched water 
therefore water well drill great enough depth tap main ground water body unique mineral concentrate analysis water may valueless geochemical guide 
area concentration desire mineral appear high valid conclusion make entire groundwater basin hydrologically geocheinically study show unique water occurs could possibly account unique mineral source
