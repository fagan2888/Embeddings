abstract this study aim assess mechanical importance conspicuous sclerenchymatous dictyoxylon cortex extinct gymnosperm lyginopteris oldhamia compare latter extant angiosperm carica papaya ochroma pyramidal possess cortex compose mechanically relevant wedge phloem ﬁbres 
our study show anatomical structure cortex oldhamia similar papaya pyramidal comparable variation occur cortex oldhamia find papaya pyramidal reorienting oblique stem branch 
this similarity adaptable anatomical structure lead conclusion cortex oldhamia also able readjust orientation stem branch reaction mechanical stress show papaya pyramidal 
this ﬁnding support hypothesis oldhamia stem might well self support young ontogenetic stage become semi self support climb old ontogenetic stage

introduction carica papaya ochroma pyramidal posse self support erect stem height sprecher fletcher respectively occur tropical subtropical region 
stem stiffness tree papaya pyramidal provide considerable part secondary phloem form lattice like arrangement partly sclerenchymatous ﬁbres resemble similarly arrange outer dictyoxylon mesh cortex lyginopteris oldhamia extinct specie common upper carboniferous europe myr 
also dictyoxylon cortex consist probably sclerenchymatous ﬁbres 
these cortical structure mechanically important sclerenchyma ﬁbres responsible mechanical stability necessary withstand internal external load whereas wood play limit mechanical role three genus 
this substantiate fact pyramidal one low wood density chave wood completely lack parenchymatous xylem papaya sprecher
