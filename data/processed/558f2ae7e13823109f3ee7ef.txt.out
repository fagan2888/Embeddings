addition intraformational fold todilto limestone probably result flowage poorly consolidated lime flank broad fold likely broad fold develop part long todilto deposition 
jurassic fold develop contemporaneously deposition jurassic rock likely fold influence deposition distribution rock 
the sandstone morrison formation laguna ambrosia lake district interpret thus influence 
the jackpile sandstone shape shoestring sand rougfrly parallel major easterly trend set jurassic fold data cross lamination suggest sand transport direction fig addition thickness morrison formation beneath jackpile sandstone increase much foot margin shoestring center

the know deposit find outcrop subsurface exploration moderately shallow depth within mile north outcrop possible pattern frequency distribution deposit near outcrop continue formation northward increase depth burial toward center san juan basin circumstance undiscovered resource would extremely large 
basis interpretation know geologic relation however seem likely deposit tend cluster zone least mile wide behind present outcrop idea permit concept southern san juan basin mineral belt 
even though concept restrict favorable ground geographically amount unexplored ground within limit belt enough contain several time much uranium resource know 
the gologic evidence reason belt review 
short distance south gallup laguna area morrison formation cut unconformity underlies dakota sandstone 
although deposition morrison undoubtedly extend short distance south line existence broad area nondeposition 
central southern new mexico suggest southern limit deposition morrison far south present southern limit fig 
the todilto limestone also pinch deposition 
edge along line short distance south laguna east gallup still far south entrada cut pre dakota erosion 
the galluplaguna area seem close southern edge general basin deposition jurassic rock colorado plateau region accumulate 
perhaps tectonic movement jurassic form sustained basin cause minor flexure gallup laguna area 
these flexures probably give rise intraformational fold todilto limestone prepare ro6k later ore deposition flexure may also control position trend stream form sandstone lens host deposit morrison formation 
rate marginal relation rock favorable ore deposit extend much farther south present line outcrop gallup laguna 
evidence limit predict northern edge conceive belt even tenuous ore bear rock bury 
course pre dakota flexuring could extend northward basin jurassic deposition likely deformation concentrate along perhaps restrict basin margin 
laguna district jackpile sandstone thin northward jackpile mine significant uranium deposit know mile north jackpile mine 
there little exploration north know deposit ambrosia lake gallup district 
increase depth burial ore bearing rock 
there evidence however ore bear sandstone locally thin northward vicinity deposit ambrosia lake district 
where sandstone show apparent thin become uniform character 
this great uniformity sandstone suggest deposit change basinward possibly quieter uniform fluvial condition deposition sedijaents probably unfavorable formation significant uranium deposit 
summary reason existence belt known uranium deposit fully know fact remain however belt parallel number control end definitive geologic feainarea

the known reserve 
total value one billion dollar reserve morrison formation 
morrison formation ore mineral principal deposit intimately mixed carbonaceous material impregnate sandstone form tabular body lie nearly parallel bedding 
most deposit central part thick sandstone lens 
gentle fold jurassic time may control position stream form sandstone lens 
the ore mineral todilto limestone impregnate replace limestone deform intraformational folding faulting 
this deformation may cause flowage unconsolidated lime mud flank jurassic flexure intraformational fold localize along flexure many elongate parallel 
typically ore body todilto long narrow 
sandstone pip numerous eastern part area also localize along flank jurassic flexure 
their position habit suggest result slump action consolidation bed cut 
only one several hundred pipe know yielded uranium ore one reportedly contain ore 
likely pipe provide loci deposition uranium rather channelways ascend descend uraniumbearing solution 
deformation jurassic time may direct indirect influence localization uranium deposit rock jurassic age definite evidence later tectonic structure
