thus one attempt ass food chain relation higher trophic level organism examine presume food source commonly organisms low trophic level deniro epstein rau other fry sherr 
the use stable isotope make assessment base fact element include carbon nitrogen number isotopic form 
addition isotopic composition organic matter include live organism control key chemical physical reaction 
photosynthesis reaction plant example preferential selection stable carbon isotope 12c relative slightly heavy 13c isotope due kinetic isotope fractionation occur photosynthesis reaction park epstein 
this result enrichment plant cellular material lighter isotope 
such isotopic fractionation plant pass high trophic level organism predator low trophic level organisms little change 
this isotopic fractionation occur even though normal biochemical process may significantly alter component cell fry sherr 
the phenomenon applicable predator prey food chain 
thus although stable carbon isotope ratio predator organism closely resemble food source one usually would see small significant positive increase ratio predator organism 
various study consumer organism show stable carbon isotope ratio positive organism fee 
consumer organism usually stable nitrogen isotope ratio positive food source 
this enrichment occur transfer energy carbon one trophic level next high trophic level although exception rule rau other gear other fry sherr

possible however explore possibility data available study 
the striped bass data fig 
indicate distinct food habit different growth stage 
the two small length strip bass positive mean carbon nitrogen isotope ratio 
although standard deviation overlap mean nitrogen ratio two small length fish separate indicate possibility different primary food source 
this consistent previous suggestion strip bass less length subsist yolk sac remnant length begin use zooplankton neomysis shrimp primary food source 
contrast small fish carbon nitrogen isotope ratio four long length strip bass similar 
these similar ratio positive position relative neomysis shrimp large zooplankton support possibility strip bass change latter food source time reach length 
addition primary food source strip bass seem remain unchanged beyond point least length great 
the data wastewater treatment plant effluent support direct role carbon nitrogen source strip bass food chain 
noted fish often present large number area municipal wastewater treatment plant effluent discharge 
this phenomenon may represent opportunity fish feed zooplankton organism whose production might stimulate increased bacterial productivity result bacterial use dissolve carbon rather particulate organic carbon effluent rau other 
this would constitute indirect use effluent nutrient consumption intermediate trophic level consumer strip bass contrast direct use effluent fish 
this possibility consistent mean carbon nitrogen isotope ratio zooplankton neomysis shrimp strip bass measure study

the measured carbon nitrogen transfer various trophic level presume strip bass food chain reasonable consistent presume food chain relation estuary 
inability isolate homogeneous sample low three trophic level component food chain allow detailed assessment carbon nitrogen transfer low middle trophic level food chain 
carbon nitrogen flux 
the possibility unsampled component trophic level trophic level represent low three component food chain represent large zooplankton neomysis shrimp warrant study 
the carbon isotope characteristic large zooplankton relative low trophic level organism might use food source inconsistent expect positive increase carbon ratio one progress low high trophic level 
the carbon data indicate large zooplankton also may use one three component plus unidentified component negative carbon isotope ratio measure study food source 
some possibility cannot substantiate available data peat carbon deplete phytoplankton perhaps dissolve organic carbon 
these conclusion consistent finding study food habit larval strip bass sacramento san joaquin estuary 
basis analysis stomach content larval strip bass cyclopoid calanoid copepodids eurytemora sinocalanus bosmina report main food organism term number stomach length strip bass larva take low sacramento river miller 
the abundance bosmina cyclopoid calanoid copepodids decrease size larva increase 
neomysis shrimp consume striped bass larva less length increase abundance thereafter increase size larva 
the abundant organism strip bass larva lower san joaquin river bosmina eurytemora 
the abundance eurytemora increase bosmina decrease increase size strip bass larva

intensive sample program temporally spatially need provide resolution stable isotope characteristic strip bass food chain structure outline study fig

summary conclusion 
the mean nitrogen isotope data indicate large zooplankton neomysis shrimp constitute consumer intermediate position lower trophic level component larval strip bass

previously note simenstad wissmar report stable carbon isotope ratio deciduous coniferous debris collect long fjord puget sound washington 
another potential source negative carbon isotope ratio might peat common estuarine system 
furthermore individual genus zooplankton collect initial reconnaissance study also show negative stable carbon isotope ratio include sinocalanus daphnia 
although available data support possibility latter genus zooplankton use primary food source large zooplankton neomysis shrimp might constitute unidentified component 
the possibility also exist deplete phytoplankton might source negative carbon isotope ratio 
the available data allow study various possibility

fish increase length 
the small fish less large positive mean nitrogen isotope ratio 
the longer fish great negative mean carbon isotope ratio 
the striped bass show highly variable carbon isotope ratios apparently represent transitional growth stage

the large fish great subsist primarily neomysis shrimp well intake large zooplankton 
the class strip bass represent 6to fish seem represent fish subsist primarily remnant yolk sacs various size zooplankton bosmina eurytemora sinocalanus 
these conclusion consistent result previously cite study content larval strip bass stomach miller 
group strip bass constitute top component food chain least negative stable isotope ratio measure study
