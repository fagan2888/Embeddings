geologic structure history 
the geologic structure history district naturally fall two distinct part particularly economic consideration 
the main division structural history concern first feature find pre tertiary rock second feature find tertiary volcanic rock 
data fragmentary immediate vicinity district permit much discussion pre cambrian structure history 
the structure tertiary rock great immediate importance ore deposit develop entirely within tertiary formation 
subsequent deposition paleozoic sedimentary formation bonanza region underwent strong folding thrust faulting 
the system fold fault old volcanic formation presumably produce late cretaceous eocene time 
the fold paleozoic sedimentary rock trend north northwest 
viii outline the report 
roughly parallel north end sangre cristo range lie east 
along kerber creek foot paleozoic formation override obliquely trend fold thrust block precambrian granite 
the thrust block move north northeasterly direction relative young underlie sedimentary rock 
because apparent difference direction application force cause earlier fold later thrust faulting infer represent two epochs deformation although perhaps different part single major cycle 
after fold thrust faulting occur period extensive erosion eocene time 
great thickness sedimentary formation must destroy result hilly surface expose remnant paleozoic formation underlie precambrian basement 
because great extent erosion synclinal body paleozoic sedimentary rock preserve 
the average topographic relief develop erosion surface estimate least foot region bonanza district 
the tertiary volcanism probably begin oligocene time result formation high volcanic plateau 
the structure tertiary volcanic rock exists explain simply moderate local dome plateau formation deep seat migration molten magma follow collapse dome intrusive mass close approach surface weaken crust sufficiently permit extrusion lava 
presumably extrusion lava result loss volume support force intrusive body crust fail subside locally weight 
the old lava break many small fault block thrown downward successive step toward central area collapse 
the central part subside area appear within eastern part region map probably include third total area affect subsidence 
the fault block steeply tilt away central axis dome least western northern southern flank 
the uniform unusual character tilt attributed part initial tilt produce dome greatly increase locally congressional stress become active subsidence 
theoretical explanation advance contend partial rotation fault block occur result shear fault shear fault part curve combination give effect curve fault produce vary resultant gravitative compression force act subsiding crust 
fault fissuring 
the fault system different part district local characteristic place underground working sufficiently large permit discriminate study 
actual practice find difficult distinguish readily fissure produce notable faulting produce comparatively minor faulting fracturing 
however systematic observation large number mineralize fissure lead conclusion vein occupy fault fissure displacement range foot foot 
the fissure range dip 
the average dip fissure systematically record large underground working northern part district near per cent dip range 
most fault normal 
part district high angle reverse 
fault apparently result shear large fault block subject compression subsidence 
accordance characteristic fissure interest mining operation divide low angle high angle dip 
the fissure fissure zone low angle dip less comprise per cent group cite 
the wall low angle fault show subject great pressure friction faulting 
most fault contain heavy premineral gouge broken wall likely present troublesome problem mining 
ore body lie fault fissure lenticular extensive steeper fissure 
fissure high angle dip premineral gouge commonly thick difficulty control broken ground obviously much less along fault low angle dip 
fissure vein high angle dip successfully mine district shrinkage stop method 
the angle dip certain faults decrease depth shallowness mine working permit sufficient observation generalize regard change 
decrease dip within vertical range foot show one low angle fault sharp change probably uncommon 
the existence apparent normal fault dip suggest represent part curve fault fault plane originally steeper tilt since formation 
stress generate wall faults period fault cause formation hang wall fracture parallel fracture 
certain hangingwall fracture commercially mineralize average grade ore find district permit mine explore small fissure type 
ore deposit general feature 
the division district different belt zone metal deposition 
recognize early worker local miner 
only two main division however northern southern part appear justified basis consistent difference character vein metal content 
the vein northern part base metal vein characteristic low intermediate temperature formation 
they typically high silica moderately high sulphide content 
some show primary zone metal content change lead silver lead zinc vein near outcrops copper silver pyritic vein depth 
the mineral zone place telescope within vertical range 5qo foot complex ore common 
the principal sulphide mineral pyrite sphalerite galena silver bearing tennantite chalcopyrite enargite bornite stromeyerite chalcocite 
the gangue mineral mainly quartz barite manganiferous calcite rhodonite 
locally tellurides silver gold represent late stage miner 
southern part district vein type generally assume form comparatively low temperature 
their sulphide content low many vein exceed per cent 
quartz rhodochrosite fluorite common gangue mineral adularia find vein 
the sparse sulphides commonly pyrite chalcopyrite sphalerite galena pyrargyrite proustite tennantite 
the principal economic value vein silver content primary sulphide shoot enrich sulphide zone extent manganese oxide content completely oxidize vein 
outline the report 
alteration icall rock 
essentially part district two main stage sequence miner recognize 
the first stage follow closely development fault fissure 
consist generally barren silicification convert lava near fissure channel tough jaspery rock make largely fine grain quartz less extent chalcedony 
some jasper particularly replace andesitic lava red other gray white 
product chemical decomposition rock deposit together early silica comprise hematite diaspore alunite barite zunyite rutile kaolin mineral 
place silicified lavas contain much pyrite rarely sulphide 
this early stage rock alteration produce tough hard rock cause difficulty drive mine tunnel certain tunnel penetrate fissured body rock several hundred foot across completely altered manner 
the jasper commonly brecciate near strong vein second stage miner consist vein fill gangue metal sulphide follow brecciation 
second stage principal alteration fissure wall entirely different first stage consist mainly micaceous alteration rock 
the mineral form wall rock sericite chlorite carbonate mainly calcite quartz pyrite 
the intensely altered rock soft mechanically weak 
the importance distinguish two type hydrothermal alteration wall point jasper stage produce ore preceded concentration 
metal sulphide fissure 
the silicified rock however indicate presence near fissure channel exist formation ore deposit jasper repeatedly brecciate cemented mineral second stage good evidence channel active fault fissure 
because nearly complete removal element compose lavas exception silica stage silicification analogy chemical activity modern acid spring fumaroles conclude early stage wall rock alteration accomplish either fumarolic activity acid hot spring water 
the late stage wall rock alteration vein fill presume occurred decrease acidic emanation product alkaline neutral solution 
influence country rock ore deposition 
conclude different country rock differential influence chemical process affect ore deposition 
the principal effect different country rock appear mechanical influence rock nature opening along fault 
the character opening amount premineral gouge contain indirectly affect process ore deposition 
andesitic lava fracture cleanly flow plane parting influence direction fracture mechanically favorable rock 
intense early silicification wall rock also favor late formation opening suitable ore deposition

production and history 
summary and conclusion show part bonanza structure map detail deformation produce dome bulge probably unsymmetrical shape 
the old know group volcanic rock occupies large area central part dome young lavas dip away north west southeast center 
area east district structure lavas imperfectly know position somewhat remote tensely deformed rock lavas dip gently westward toward center district 
several mile west district antoro range lava dip gently avestward toavard saguache creek valley 
thus area intensely deform rock essentially surround slightly deform rock conclusion reach structure cause shalioav deforming force local origin 
many fault fissure occupy dike igneous rock much fumarolic alteration miner avhich indicate deformed rock underlie intrusive body large size 
conclude intrusive body avas principal cause local dome faulting 
both normal reverse fault present district conclude field evidence fault aver due partly simple tension partly combination tensional compression force 
the simpler tensional fault find largely central part rlomed area shear fault prevalent zone bound least north avest side area 
the clo association betaveen steeply tilt fault block zone shear lava lead conclusion shear fault extreme tilt lava aver relate phenomenon probably contemporaneous development 
the explanation structure base upon assumption local concentration compression force avhich developed flank dome cause fault block shear rotate 
west side dome lava dip consistently westavard fault resulted series step fault avhich doavnthroavn side toavard central part dome 
suggested structural feature may cause rock west flank dome slide eastward final collapse occupy space vacate underlying intrusive magma 
vieav many low angle fault dip eastward toavard center deform 4s461 
area suggest collapse crust may act manner somewhat approach action superficial landslide 
loav angle fault curve dip may cause part westavard tilt formation 
the relative importance either shear faulting tension fault intrusive action possible cause tilting probably differs different part district extreme tilt probably assign largely shear fault possible cause appear inadequate 
the relative age shear fault low angle normal fault generally know absence shear fault displace low angle mineralize fault bonanza cocomongo suggest lowangle normal fault later age particular area
