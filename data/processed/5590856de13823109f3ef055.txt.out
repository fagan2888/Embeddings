ore magmatic undoubtedly precambrian hydrothermal precambrian age less certain 
magmatic concentration presupposes settle heavy sulfide phase body molten magma ore near base parent magma body

particularly noteworthy occurrence east ore body split vein 
section m17 a17 might expect hydrothermal deposit 
geologic mapping disclose ore deposit although many belt hornblende gneiss 
both structural geochemical evidence appear favor hydrothermal origin 
magmatic ore deposit commonly surround extensive primary geochemical anomaly relate high ore metal content parent igneous rock 
many magmatic deposit nickel chromium example surround exten sive area nickel chromium content rock soil abnormally high
