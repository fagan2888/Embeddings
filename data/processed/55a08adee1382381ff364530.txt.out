hydrologic inventory the lompoc subarea california perennial supply 
evenson worts perennial supply study consider quantity ground water withdrawn year year without deplete quantity ground water storage extent withdrawal rate longer feasible increased pumping cost deterioration water quality 
the fact hydrologic equation near balance period near average climatic condition indication quantity water pump well significantly excess replenishment ground water
