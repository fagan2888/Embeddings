foreword the regional aquifer system analysis program the regional aquifer system analysis rasa program start follow congressional mandate develop quantitative appraisal major ground water system united state 
the rasa program represent systematic effort study number nation important aquifer system aggregate underlie much country represent important component nation total water supply 
general boundary study identify hydrologic extent system accordingly transcend political subdivision investigation often arbitrarily limit past 
the broad objective study assemble geologic hydrologic geochemical information analyze develop understanding system develop predictive capability contribute effective management system 
the use computer simulation important element rasa study develop understanding natural undisturbed hydrologic system change bring human activity provide mean predict regional effect future pumping stress 
the final interpretive result rasa program present series geological survey professional paper describe geology hydrology geochemistry regional aquifer system 
each study within rasa program assign single professional paper number volume interpretive material warrant separate topical chapter consider principal element investigation may publish 
the series rasa interpretive report begin professional paper thereafter continue numerical sequence interpretive product subsequent study become available
