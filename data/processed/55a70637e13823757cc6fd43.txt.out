introduction cusp 
cusp stand caltech usgs seismic processing system 
cusp proper group program write carl johnson modify bob dollar peter johnson kate hutton doug give 
many auxiliary program access manipulate process data also write various author available interested user 
the cusp system auxiliary program locate vax750 computer seismological laboratory caltech vax750 pasadena usgs office wilson avenue 
the cit vax usually research access computer see kate hutton set account machine 
work usgs vax person see doug give 
cusp proper require particular directory structure group system logic operate 
the auxiliary program require specific directory structure logic abbreviation define program convenience leapjgetdata com 
each event process give call cusp number form digits depend computer data originate 
there three main type data contain earthquake information 
catalog data 
phase data 
digital seismogram 
catalog data month keep line file call cat kin 
since file readable cusp program special cusp directory structure convenience cat bin binary file cat li ascii file make cat kin 
all catalog phase data see kept subdirectory citvax disk1 cit each month catalogue keep different subdirectory cit directory example cit 88janj contains catalogue file january 
the catalogue file call cat kin cat bin cat li every subdirectory 
catalogue entire collection cat bin kept current cit cat 
this directory contain bin file year instead month 
source catread use search event 
hold data present 
phase data event keep line month non ascii database structure file call mem 
the mem file monthte event keep cit subdirectory month place cat kin month 
after event month locate finalized routine processing complete mem file put onto magnetic tape call freeze tape access procedure call rdfrz 
the mem file translate ascii file memdck makephas 
memdck produce file dck suffix contain information phase data 
makephas produce file suffix contains phase data optional file suffix contain information digital record station 
cusp come existence ascii data available magnetic tape 
phase data many event specific time period need ascii tape make month finalized month contain file per month phase data hypoinverse format 
these tape keep usgs computer room 
digital seismogram event keep line hour binary file call grm 
after event locate grm file put onto magnetic tape call archive tape 
however tape label cusp backup tape 
the data access procedure call snark tapecopy 
the original grm file block size 
when put archive tape reside block size 
the seismogram copy tape file grm suffix block size use snark 
alternatively copy file suffix block size use tapecopy 
either format accomodated auxiliary program write use digital seismogram data 
want use seismogram data outside cusp also need file contains information station record begin end sequential grm file 
the file obtain mem file use makephas 
office menlo park use shadowcard format rather format 
the shadowcard format accomodated program future 
archive tape available april present

trout consider one three main type data yet often one begin look data 
trout event plot waveform plus information event 
create routine processing event paper copy plot event keep file cabinet measure room caltech seismo 
file chronological order date time 
before late august trout plot contain plot waveform station trigger event 
after date trout contain waveform closest station trigger event 
addition waveform plot contains location event latitude longitude residual error location coda amplitude magnitude arrival time phase pick quality pick 
addition histogram coda amplitude magnitude 
the trout useful get arrival time event instead read magnetic tape interested small number event preview waveform event

this tell first problem also tell 
location problem 
there subroutine call fatal resident cusp libjkom for 
every well write cusp program subroutine call condition could interpret error 
purpose print error line syssoutput return parameter ire indicate program error occur 
look code say forget for find subroutine call accompany statement like 
call getcklone ire i ifcires 
get cusp subroutine also reside cusp lib whatever case look tuple klone kin match partially complete one array kin return value ire depend success 
positive ire generally mean success zero mean tuple negative value mean error condition 
the ier mark location program subroutine 
ire less one 
get less complete success statement pass message error occur next level subroutine 
woodshed call fatal forget ier ires i return 
each level subroutine woodshed many case error trace downward source string fatal message like first example 
batch job message appear log file 
run interactive mode appear screen 
they helpful debug program troubleshooting situation 
addition write message syssoutput fatal also set symbol call exstat exit status equal ire 
dcl equivalent system keep track error occur 
base run clone forget sho sym exstat res base exstat exstat 
then goto result here forget fortran code return negative exstat ire fact value record re well location within bat file base 
well write bat file section different base well write cusp fortran routine use i place failure possible 
later bat file result call memres sec mem local re set event process nonzero result 
the event experience failure forget post forget instead forget forget run silent 
the indicates location bat file indicate ire cusp program call 
the log file contain rest comment fatal
