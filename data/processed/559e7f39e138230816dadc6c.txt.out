outcrop observation

measure well production peak monthly production pmp define volume oil gas produce productive calendar month history well 
identify peak month production volumes adjusted account fact calendar month consist day 
variation pmp reflect variation rate hydrocarbon flow wellbore well deliver 
because short measurement period pmp commonly affected factor relate depletion hydrocarbon reservoir 
however short measurement period also mean variation pmp case might reflect human induced engineering factor rather situ natural reservoir factor 
peak consecutive twelve month production refer convenience remainder paper peak yearly production pyp define volume oil gas produce productive twelve month period differentiate productive calendar year history well 
pyp way compromise indicator well deliver 
the longer measurement period compare peak monthly production increase probability variation pyp indicative geologic factor rather engineering factor 
however one year period reservoir depletion could start play role pyp might mix measure reservoir volume well production rate 
cumulative production total volume oil gas recover throughout produce history well 
because well exhibit exponential hyperbolic production decline function time cumulative production old well well curve production versus time flatten asymptotically begin approximate ultimate recovery 
although old well ideal measure ultimate recovery low unless well abandon advantage precision cumulative production direct measurement whereas ultimate recovery estimate base projection future 
old well variation reflect variation reservoir volume access wellbore 
old well define study well current monthly production less percent initial monthly production 
the production parameter peak monthly production peak yearly production cumulative production measure net result multiplicative geologic process might expect approximate log normal distribution 
for reason production data study plot graph paper ax arrange show figure log normal distribution plot straight line 
other log normal distribution geology include diverse property grain sizes sediment magnitude earthquake gold assay value mineral deposit frequency flood sizes oil gas field koch link davis 
actual practice plot pmp pyp form exact log normal distribution 
true log normal distribution cutoff high end offer increasingly small chance increasingly large value 
however pmp pyp finite upper limit dictate hydrocarbon place drainage area permeability etc upper end probability distribution therefore truncate 
the low end distribution might also truncate economic consideration poor well might complete produce become part data set 
quantitative measure production variability the slope probability distribution pmp pyp figure direct indicator variability data set 
steeper slope equate great production heterogeneity 
horizontal line figure would represent gas field perfectly uniform production characteristic 
parameter proportional slope four probability distribution figure would provide quantitative numerical representation production heterogeneity 
such parameter refer variation coefficient calculate use measure dispersion range data set divide measure central tendency mean median stell brown schmoker dyman other 
for study dimensionless variation coefficient calculate f95 f95 f50 5th 95th 50th median fractiles probability distribution pmp pyp 
these fractiles pick directly plot illustrate figure 
note figure increase corresponds increase slope probability distribution thus increase well production variability 
because dimensionless variable range value normalize median value variation coefficient independent magnitude production

reservoir north central montana least heterogeneous 
the bakken formation cretaceous reservoir bowdoin field extremely low matrix permeability range less 
production control fracture system whereas morrow sandstone reservoir commonly conventional matrix permeability 
the relatively low variation coefficient bakken field fig 
suggest fracture system reservoir might extremely heterogeneous scale inch fact quite homogeneous scale drainage area well 
this circumstance also note stell brown examine bakken formation along two fractured chalk reservoir
