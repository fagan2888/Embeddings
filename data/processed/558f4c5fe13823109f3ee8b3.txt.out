regional sample direct correlation appear helium mercury concentration long valley however apparent inverse relationship exist around area surficial hydrothermal alteration mercury concentration high helium concentration low 
anomalously low concentration helium soil appear area visible surficial hydrothermal alteration casa diablo area clay deposit little antelope valley near hot spring scatter area fig 
although alteration visible place helium concentration low whole area active past depth well surface rinehart ross huber rinehart d19 
the anomalously low helium concentration may represent area helium still present trap beneath hydrothermally alter rock self seal due silicification argil ization zeolitization bailey 
anomalously high concentration helium appear along ton creek fault enters caldera south southeast caldera near owen river gorge near zone north trend fault rinehart ross 
although high helium concentration appear along hilton creek fault south side caldera anomalous concentration continue within caldera 
the lack continuity high helium concentration may due either seal fault product hydrothermal alteration dilution helium large concentration gas escape open fault 
more detailed sampling along near know fault might help explain lack continuity helium concentration 
traverse sample the pattern helium soil concentration similar regional traverse sample 
however helium concentration exactly close spaced traverse sample disclose local feature regional sample 
noticeable similarity low helium area around casa diablo hot spring resurgent dome 
anomalously high helium concentration traverse sample occur near owen river 
comparison helium concentration geophysical measurement geological survey conduct multidisciplinary earth science study long valley area 
general feature identify geophysical investigation little correlation anomalous concentration helium soil gas either regional sample close space traverse sample 
helium concentration show correlation temperature measure meter depth drill hole lachenbruch sorey fig 
aeromagnetic data kane other fig 
anomalously high concentration helium correlate resistivity anomaly 
however anomalously low concentration helium occur area low resistivity casa diablo hot spring resistivity low believe due alteration hot geothermal fluid stanley other fig 
water sample spite fact gas exsolved water sample dilute considerably approximately ambient air head space water five nine sample contain enough helium yield total helium concentration great ambient air 
concentration helium degas water sample comparable helium concentration soil gas surround area 
correlation exist amount helium exsolved water sample measure temperature water 
helium least soluble water morrison johnston wei however low helium concentration cluster around temperature 
hot water discharge long valley thermal spring primarily meteoric water heat hot rock move system 
sorey lewis table use geochemical mixing model calculate temperature hot spring depth 
the subsurface spring temperature list table quantity helium exsolved spring appear relate temperature either 
subsurface condition evidently complex 
helium exsolved water differ ppb sample two hot spring locate meter apart hot spring park 
difference helium content water sample may relate proximity spring well local fault serve channel helium emerge deep sierra nevada frontal fault 
extensive sample helium spring seeps might reveal subsurface condition 
regional traverse sample yield similar result 
close spaced sample yield detailed information 
anomalously high concentration helium soil gas appear hilton creek fault fault outside caldera 
within caldera anomalously low concentration helium soil gas occur several area high mercury concentration 
these also area visible surficial hydrothermal alteration suspect fossil hydrothermal alteration 
the association low helium concentration alteration potentially useful locate zone subsurface go hydrothermal activity study geothermal history area 
quantity helium exsolved water sample represent localized condition within geothermal system long valley 
helium water measurement might useful large number sample collect analyzed total gas content
