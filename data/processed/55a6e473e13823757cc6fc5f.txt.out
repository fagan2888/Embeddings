cause landsliding the cause landslide generally increase weight decrease shear strength krynine judd 
the cause landslide also describe external produce increase shear stress unaltered shear resistance material adjoin slope internal reduce shear resistance slope material unaltered shearing stress terzaghi

water major contribute factor landslide increase weight decrease shear resistance 
climate topography geology vegetation activity animal also contribute factor 
most factor interrelate difficult evaluate individual contribution landsliding 
general particular combination factor rather one specific factor contributes landsliding 
climate geology probably basic contribute factor 
the climate determine amount distribution precipitation generally ultimate source surface ground water geology climate together influence topography vegetation 
density human animal population 
the topography turn may determine microclimates small area 
the composition structure rock major factor contribute landsliding 
for example soft well bed alternate sand clay fracture sheared fault easily absorb water cause reduce shear resistance often slippage along fracture bed plane 
rainfall primary source water contribute landsliding san francisco bay region

geologic factor make easy rainwater enter ground contribute landaliding 
one factor montmorillonite clay rock orinda formation overlie soil 
during wet season clay absorbs much water increase weight rock soil decrease shear resistance 
during dry season clay lose water shrink cause formation crack several inch wide several foot deep provide easy access rainwater next wet season 
other geologic factor affect penetration water ground stratigraphy orinda formation consist primarily alternate layer sandstone conglomerate shale deformation stratum fold commonly dip steeply numerous joint faults fracture cut rock 
rainwater find easy access formation exposure tilt sandstone conglomerate bed many relatively soft porous 
the joint allow passage water shale well sandstone conglomerate 
the water move downward laterally sandstone conglomerate bed along interface sandstone conglomerate shale absorb shale 
pore water pressure may build sandstone layer confine less pervious shale bed 
these pressure contribute landsliding krynine judd 
water within formation decrease shear resistance especially along joint plane lesser extent along bed plane many place poorly define 
most fault cut orinda formation contain impervious clay gouge range fraction inch much inch thickness many place gouge act barrier ground water 
water move sandstone bed dam fault pore water pressure sandstone increase 
the increase pore pressure make rock susceptible slide 
fault appear major geologic factor contribute landsliding orinda formation although slickensided clay coat fault surface may infrequently slide surface slide 
geologic factor indirectly related landsliding effect geology topography 
obvious landsliding take place perfectly flat surface 
rock uplifted erosion begin immediately 
where stream erosion take place rapidly valley side generally steep 
the rock orinda formation uplift geologically recent time still actively erode 
therefore hill slope relatively steep weight rock soil underlie slope 
increase shear resistance decrease tend move slope stable position 
rapid erosion continue equilibrium slope constantly disturb landsliding form mass movement continue slope reduce gentle gradient 
another geologic factor influence landsliding relationship bed joint land surface

although much relatively minor slide acceptable maintenance problem highway department may source major damage expense business establishment home owner 
landslide housing area may undermine damage patio driveways swim pool foundation construct slope close top edge slope push retain wall slough park lot patio building damage lawn garden construct base slope 
most home owner financial resource correct even small landslide may require several thousand dollar repair properly 
construct dwelling therefore essential prevent even small amount landsliding 
damage dwelling structure may possibly avoid thorough geological engineering investigation make propose building site 
determine slide potential slide condition problem inherent natural setting 
suitable engineering design may possible prevent reduce damage 
slide part orinda formation probably cannot prevent part may prevent extensive drain special engineering design construction 
land would highly expensive develop housing might use park recreational facility 
water surface underground major factor contribute landsliding 
therefore common approach prevent correct landslide prevent much water possible enter ground remove rapidly possible entrance cannot prevent 
prevention correction drainage discuss root baker marshall 
addition method suggest author water roof drain build collect one main drain run street gutter storm sewer 
gopher exterminate hillside development burrow provide way water enter ground 
the data assemble preliminary report indicate landslide involve bedrock orinda formation natural slope tend abundant northeast face slope bed dip direction opposite hill slope 
exposure major factor contribute soil slide natural slope soil slide abundant north northwest northeast facing slope 
the possibility bedrock soil slide consider planning development northerly face hillside 
landslide involve bedrock cut slop commonly show evidence movement joint plane 
landslide cut approximately normal strike bed cut strike dip bed intersects cut slope approximately may move joint bedding plane 
some landslide cut bed dip direction opposite cut face also show evidence movement joint plane 
cut bed dip direction cut gently may slide bed plane 
slope exposure appear major factor contribute landsliding bedrock cut 
when plan cut bedrock special attention pay relationship cut bed jointing rock 
exposure appear major factor contribute landslide artificial fill 
fill north east northwest northeast exposure design place particular care especially prone surficial sliding exposure 
additional precaution might observe help prevent landsiiding 
cut toe know slide without first assure stabilization remain slide material 
make cut place fill across even minor hillside drainage channel without provide drainage water may flow wet season 
plant deep root plant require intensive watering aid hold slope slide 
the effectiveness planting limit however plant alone retain extensive deepseated landslide 
cautious regard irrigation hillside area
