abstract evaluate frictional strength seismogenic fault main ethiopian rift mer invert available well constrained earthquake focal mechanism 
the regional stress ﬁeld give trend plunge respectively agree well previous fault kinematic focal mechanism inversion 
determine coeﬃcient friction seismogenic fault assume pore pressure hydrostatic condition 
slip seismogenic fault occur

general coeﬃcient friction mer compatible value standard deviation 
the shear stress range mpa similar crustal shear stress observe extensional tectonic regime global compilation shear stress major fault zone 
the maximum shear stress observe ductile crust seismologically determine brittle ductile transition bdt zone 
below bdt crust assume weak due thermal modiﬁcation high pore ﬂuid pressure 
our result indicate linearly increase shear stress depth 
argue mer upper crust strong deforms accord coulomb frictionalfailure criterion 
introduction thorough understanding regional stress ﬁeld paramount importance constrain strength fault crust along actively deform plate boundary 
general fault zone relatively weaker surround stable crust zoback 
however still question regard whether strength individual fault deform region varies also whether strength fault varies along strike fault 
recent study floyd 
show frictional parameter fault may vary kilometer distance depend lithological control 
fault strength varies spatially also temporally 
review experimental result toro 
suggested strength fault could reduce earthquake 
coeﬃcient friction use proxy model strength fault crust 
laboratory estimate usually high range byerlee although low value report use rotary shear apparatus san andreas fault 
some researcher argue value really exist seismic slip find high heat ﬂow extensive melting 
pseudotachilite along exhume fault mulargia bizzarri 
the apparent absence rock type use argue coeﬃcient friction lower laboratory estimate 
line numerical modeling study active tectonic area 
east african rift ear bird argue friction coeﬃcient much low laboratory estimate 
this agree recent laboratory experiment find pressure condition equivalent depth toro 
mulargia bizzarri propose multi stage earthquake process involve high friction coeﬃcient ﬁrst stage 
the high friction stage induces high temperature almost immediately induce ﬂuid pressurization reduces permeability fault gouge subsequently pore pressure reach lithostatic state
