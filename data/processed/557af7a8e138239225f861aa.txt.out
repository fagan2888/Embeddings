conclusion uranium may several form coaly carbonaceous rock

some uranium appear chemically bond physically attach carbonaceous substance sufficient force physical chemical alteration carbonaceous substance generally require detach 
single organic chemical chiefly responsible fix uranium isolate though suggested humic acid 
salt coalified equivalent coal ulmins among effective uranium extractor 
single explanation yet offer know physical chemical relation uranium associate coaly carbonaceous rock accept investigator work material 
the explanation offer generally involve adsorption ion exchange formation organo uranium compound reduction uranyl ion precipitation colloidal size uraninite 
present data indicate uo2 ion may become attached one available bond carbonaceous substance humic acid possibly salt form humic acid 
hydrogen ion may exchange uranyl ion 
eventually uranyl ion bond may reduce quadrivalent form uo2 reduce action either carbonaceous material almost universally associate sulfide ion 
quadrivalent state uranium ionize readily relatively insoluble low temperature pressure 
relatively immobile condition remain dispersed colloidal form form discrete uranium mineral 
probable role coaly carbonaceous rock the geochemistry uranium uranium crustal abundance estimate ppm mason relatively minor element yet perhaps time abundant silver time abundant gold 
concentration time crustal abundance uranium approximately minimum grade uranium bear material consider commercial 
though average abundance uranium normal coaly carbonaceous rock probably even less one quarter average crustal abundance number epigenetic deposit uranium coaly rock contain time average crustal abundance 
these rock therefore consider quite effective agent concentration uranium 
because large total quantity uranium coaly carbonaceous rock represent potential large resource low grade deposit uranium may day exploit high grade deposit uranium sandstone vein exhaust 
there therefore need understand role coaly carbonaceous rock geochemistry uranium 
spite numerous publication deal geology geochemistry uranium coaly carbonaceous rock many question remain unanswered 
for example uranium readily con 
geology uranium coaly carbonaceous rock 
centrated coaly carbonaceous matter indicate laboratory experiment deposit uranium carbonaceous rock 
repeatedly observe abundant coaly carbonaceous matter associate high grade deposit uranium sandstone 
why coaly carbonaceous rock contain even high grade deposit uranium sandstone 
why apparently deposit uranium coal interior appalachian coal region united state matter lignite gulf coastal plain cretaceous coal rocky mountain region 
though firm answer cannot give question speculation follow section may provide idea future investigation 
environmental factor the deposition uranium most known uranium deposit coaly carbonaceous rock unite state think represent epigentically fix adventitious uranium 
may seem strange fossil deposit similar uraniferous mountain meadow california commonly preserve syngenetic uranium deposit coaly carbonaceous rock 
why marine black shale overlies coal part southern illinois indiana contain much percent uranium widespread area snider represent high concentration uranium sequence coaly rock coal represent concentrate carbonaceous matter practically barren uranium 
comparison environment deposition coal california mountain meadow indicate fundamental difference exist may help explain absence syngenetic deposit coal 
most large coal deposit united state form peat bog poorly drain flatlands marginal sea 
unlike california mountain meadow derive uranium ion spring water issue underlie granitic rock stream chief source uranium ion available coastal plain peat bog 
although many stream originate chiefly bog even cross heavily charge soluble brown organic matter clark uranium ion would tend remain fixed organic matter solution thus carry sea 
this fact may explain transgress continental marine sequence include coal bed pennsylvanian age interior eastern coal field united state uranium com 
monly concentrated marine black shale overlie coal bed 
the uranyl humate carry solution stream probably concentrate flocculant precipitate action sea water 
unusual circumstance must invoke explain rare syngenetic concentration uranium plant debris california mountain meadow derive uranium ion spring water 
locally sea water may source uranium plant debris deposit near strand line 
geochemical and physical factor the deposition uranium not carbonaceous matter equally effective remove uranium solution 
figure show indigenous carbonaceous matter may divide humic sapropel type basis kinds original plant remain predominate 
hydrogen rich plant remain yield sapropel matter oxygen rich plant remain yield humic matter principal constituent band coal 
each turn give rise mobile product may secondarily emplace 
sapropel matter yield bitumens include gaesous liquid petroleum variety residual product 
humic matter yield alkaline soluble humic extract include humic acid humate 
various type carbonaceous matter low rank indigenous humic matter alkaline extract therefrom commonly associate uranium 
these material closely related chemical structure humic acid group natural organic chemical compound effective sorption uranium 
high rank indigenous humic matter include bituminous anthracitic coal contain progressively less oxygen chemical constituent humic acid may thus represent one critical factor determine capacity carbonaceous matter take uranium solution 
the common loss high rank coal nitrogen sulfur also essential chemical structure humic acid may secondary factor limit capacity coal take retain uranium 
fundamental difference exist origin high rank coal low rank coal difference could partially explain scarcity uranium deposit high rank coal 
such difference postulate fuchs suggest bituminous coal form reduction plant remain without pass intermediate lignite stage 
this suggestion however accept worker believe highrank coal metamorphic product low rank coal 
uranium carbonaceous rock 
the epigenetic deposit uranium impure lignite lignitic shale seem characteristically thin submarginal marginal ore grade deposit contrast deposit sandstone 
the reason probably physical geochemical 
whereas uranium mineral sandstone may deposit mineralize laterally move solution response local chemical change environment lateral movement ground water probably common lignitic rock 
bed sandstone adjacent lignite probably transport water slight upward downward direction movement indicate bottom top preferential enrichment uranium common lignitic rock 
thus solution transport uranium expose broad area lignite approximately equal capacity opportunity take uranium 
sandstone environmental condition favor deposition uranium mineral probably localize interstitial pore fluid may tend disperse equidimensionally local mass rock 
geochemical role carbonaceous matter sandstone and coaly carbonaceous rock because uranium show direct relation carbonaceous matter sandstone marine black shale coaly carbonaceous rock geochemical merely physical explanation fact deposit sandstone yield ore coaly carbonaceous rock may contain abundant carbonaceous matter 
perhaps role carbonaceous matter somewhat different various type deposit difference may geochemical significance 
carbonaceous matter sandstone deposit apparently serve locus precipitation uranium mineral far excess uranium may retain sorption chemical reaction carbonaceous material 
where coaly carbonaceous matter take uranyl ion directly solution sorption chemical reaction concentration uranium result deposit tend function concentration solution 
simple relation demonstrate uranium mineral associate carbonaceous matter sandstone 
addition sorption uranyl ion organic chemical relate humic acid secondary alteration uranium apparently common coaly rock uranium cannot remove simple cation exchange 
this may interpret mean deposit stable organic compound uranium form discovery colloidal size coffinite uraninite gruner 
lignite fort union lignite region suggest take carbonaceous material uranyl ion may reduce quadrivalent state 
while doubt remain regard ability various type carbonaceous matter reduce uranium ordinary temperature pressure almost everywhere enough hydrogen sulfide present carbonaceous rock explain reduction uranyl ion quadrivalent state 
the process sorption reduction repeat might explain large amount uranium relative carbonaceous matter sandstone deposit 
though clearly understood formation uranyl phosphate arsenate mineral weather outcrop uraniferous impure lignite bed probably related deposition uranium mineral sandstone 
weathered impure lignite uranyl ion make available oxidation lignite concentrate deposit weathered outcrop evaporation capillary pore moisture 
the original deposition uranium mineral sandstone possibly relate reduce environment surround carbonaceous matter involve concentration evaporation 
geochemical role marine black shale and coaly carbonaceous rock just carbonaceous marine black shale phosphatic marine shale form important depository uranium marine environment also coaly carbonaceous rock form important depository uranium nonmarine environment 
however important difference exists 
whereas uranium concentrate sea water time deposition marine shale coaly carbonaceous rock rarely collect uranium time rock deposition 
most uranium concentrated groundwater solution penetrate rock long deposition burial sediment 
from viewpoint geochemical cycle uranium sedimentary rock carbonaceous phosphatic marine shale coaly carbonaceous rock complement 
during period erosion uranium make soluble introduced surface water stream tends transport sea concentrate carbonaceous marine mud probably largely rich humic compare sapropel matter swanson phosphate rich sediment 
soluble uranium introduce ground water either thermal water igneous source alteration local sedimentary rock example devitrification tuffaceous material generally deposit either sandstone coaly carbonaceous rock

geochemical enbichment ubanium coaly cabbonaceous bock coaly carbonaceous rock locally contain far great concentration uranium marine black shale even though uranium may deposit process cation exchange humic carbonaceous matter 
the difference due difference uranium concentration water normally present environment deposition relative accessibility rock mineralize ground water burial 
unlike major element sedimentary environment separate resist hydrolystates oxidates carbonate evaporates uranium tends remain dispersed throughout process weather erosion transportation sedimentation burial diagenetic alteration sediment time uranyl ion come contact humic carbonaceous matter phosphatic material 
this contact may occur one number different time place largely cause enrichment unlike major element 
uranium probably unique process many metal include certain rare metal also enrich carbonaceous rock krauskopf 
uranium differs describe krauskopf normally deficient enrich coaly carbonaceous rock 
because infrequent association soluble uranium coaly carbonaceous rock rarely mark enrichment observe 
the principle govern geochemical enrichment uranium coaly carbonaceous rock may summarize follow 
indigenous carbonaceous matter humic type alter beyond rank subbituminous coal readily extract uranyl ion solution much several percent dry weight carbonaceous matter 
the extraction probably result cation exchange chemical compound similar humic acid 
the concentration uranium coaly carbonaceous rock function follow factor 
the proportion chemically reactive humic carbonaceous matter rock 
the concentration uranyl ion solution access rock the number time fresh uraniferous solution bring contact carbonaceous matter the porosity permeability rock 
indigenous carbonaceous matter humic type contain little uranium either never expose uranium bearing solution alter point lose capacity take retain uranium 
once uranium fix carbonaceous matter tenaciously hold bound metallic organic chemical structure though time may reduce uraninite coffinite mineral form relatively stable except zone oxidation 
under natural condition uranium probably mains disseminated coaly carbonaceous rock originally deposit rock undergoes weather oxidation time uranium may redistribute sexivalent ura nium mineral form
