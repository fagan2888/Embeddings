award geological survey mccabe brother drill inc hugh harris drill inc drill hole yampa coal field moffat county colorado fig 
all hole diameter inch drill truck mount rotary drill rig july october 
the purpose project obtain information thickness quality depth continuity coal bed upper cretaceous williams fork formation yampa coal field 
many hole reach trout creek sandstone member upper cretaceous lie formation hole drill trout creek sandstone intersect coal upper part lie formation 
all hole locate within tract interest industry future coal leasing 
geological survey personnel select drill hole location obtain permission access supervise drill geophysical logging take part pre drill site inspection bureau land management supervise assist post drilling reclamation 
post drill reclamation meet bureau land management specification 
under contract mccabe harris total foot hole geophysically log follow company rocky mountain logging service hole total foot savage scientific inc hole total foot digilog inc hole total foot 
some hole drill foam fill light mud obtain resistance spontaneous potential log 
this accomplish first logging hole surface include dry upper part natural gamma density gamma gamma log could obtain 
then probe hole attempt make fill hole liquid 
finally upper part hole log 
this procedure often repeat several time result several log top part hole 
sometimes multiple run record chart paper sometimes separate chart paper 
report several chart paper use entire first run show first follow run show order make
