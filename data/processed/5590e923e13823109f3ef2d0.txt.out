outline principle 
representation magnetic field intensity frequency domain purpose spectral analysis accomplish compute fourier transform product field intensity weight function every along profile profile segment ana lyzed 
the weighting function must smooth field intensity zero extremity finite data segment seriously affect validity transforma tion

closely approximate 
fourier transform 
anomalous field intensity along length profile

note man function value unity center line segment value midway center extremity 
the fourier integral representat field use obtain power spectrum energy density multiplication complex conjugate 
spector bhattacharyya spector evaluate function number simpl source configuration show limiting case write product four factor magnetization intensity factor field orientation factor dependent direction earth field body magnetization vector depth factor finite size form factor depend dimension orientation magnetize source 
consequently long body magnetization earth field close direction dimension source small compare depth shape spectral decay cur control chiefly depth factor 
for anomaly source represent ensemble point pole map analysis line pole profile analysis infinite vertical prism mean depth sensor depth actor simply 
therefore size factor neg lected contribution first two factor issumed seriously affect shape energy spect rum give profile one may use logarithmic decay curve energy density determine depth 
47thf constant 
therefore slope 
under condition ensemble exist two characteristic depth produce discrete linear segment logarithmic energy decay curve 
for source closely approximate point dipole line dipole horizontal laminae expression complicate 
maximum frequency determine value rather 
the decay curve compute observed field data commonly somewhat bow upward result source configuration intermediate two extreme case accordingly slope method depth estimation may inappropriate 
departure ideal linear spectral decay bottomless source become drastic increase depth dipole lamina 
the general characteristic spectral energy amplitude decay curve due single multiple source configuration various depth examine detail spector sadek 
the low frequency end spectrum may completely dominated effect regional gradient single intensely magnetize deepseated source thereby mask decay due source shallower depth 
these effect minimize remove linear regional gradient total field data transformation frequency domain 
high end spectrum several undesired effect arise process digitization 
for example energy decay zero remain constant white noise level due round error finite sample interval 
the effect alias normally avoid select sufficiently small sample interval nyquist fre quency ffl 2ax beyond high frequency interest 
much serious consideration finite size factor energy density equation 
this factor frequency dependent approach unity source dimension small compare depth 
spector spector grant produce set correction curve use refine spectrum prior depth analysis 
each curve correspond particular average half width causative body vertical prism source ensemble 
possible obtain satisfactory average half width simply measure halfwidths associate total field anomaly 
the correction negative sign increase magnitude increase source size increase frequency must subtract logarithmic energy density 
without size correction measure slope linear segment decay curve would steep calculated depth would large 
this error could amount percent extreme case 
however spectrum dominated effect relatively shallow source size factor much less consequence
