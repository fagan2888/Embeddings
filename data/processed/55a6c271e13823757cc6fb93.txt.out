sample medium 
analysis stream sediment sample represent chemistry rock material erode drainage basin upstream sample site 
such information useful identifying basin contain concentration element may relate mineral deposit 
heavy mineral concentrate sample provide information chemistry certain mineral rock material erode drainage basin upstream sample site 
the selective concentration mineral many may ore related permit determination element easily detect stream sediment sample

the resultant heavy mineral sample separate three fraction use large electromagnet case modify frantz isodynamic separator 
the magnetic material primarily magnetite analyzed 
the second fraction largely ferromagnesian silicate iron oxide save analysis archival storage
