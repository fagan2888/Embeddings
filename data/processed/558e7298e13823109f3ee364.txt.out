introduction this report present formation density porosity profile calculate borehole gravity survey make geological survey dry piney oil gas field western wyoming 
borehole gravity measurement use dry piney unit primarily determine high relative accuracy situ density large volume rock extend ten hundred foot outward drill hole 
case borehole gravity survey analyze determine gravitational effect rock density anomaly associate nearby geologic structure penetrate drill hole 
remote sense geologic structure objective dry piney survey 
the borehole gravity method unique three important reason 
unlike well log technique borehole gravity measurement depend directly rock bulk density 
the large radius volume investigation insure measurement practical purpose unaffected borehole fluid borehole rugosity case cement region close borehole may modify flush invasion drilling fluid 
the method sensitive small variation formation density usually cm3 depend length borehole interval 
proven potential application borehole gravity survey include detection irregularly distribute porosity detection gas oil zone behind case evaluation recalibration conventional type well logs vertical density profile gravity map interpretation seismic modeling analysis remote detection geologic structure salt dome ore body large volume determination reservoir porosity reserve estimate monitor reservoir fluid condition production evaluation example detection gas cap con water invasion porosity evaluation unconsolidated material ground water engineering study 
the usefulness borehole gravity measurement application depend greatly types quality independent drill hole geologic geophysical data available assist analysis 
for example density profile calculate borehole gravity measurement easily convert porosity profile provide reasonable assumption make pore fluid density grain density rock
