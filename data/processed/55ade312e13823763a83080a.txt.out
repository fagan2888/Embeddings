introduction the geological survey engage program regional geologic mapping scale 
order delineate map unit geologic structure adequately area unusual geologic complexity mapping sometimes do large scale 
this map one large scale map prepared intermediate step compile geology port townsend quadrangle scale see index map 
the use orthophoto base map compromise result need suitable large scale lack base map adequate accuracy 
the original plan intermediate mapping northeastern part port townsend quadrangle area include use clear lake minute topographic quadrangle scale base 
that map derive plane table survey sufficiently accurate mapping objective 
therefore map do aerial photograph photography scale approximately compile clear lake orthophotoquad northeast one fourth clear lake minute topographic map 
addition geologic map orthophoto base three map include report index map geologic map show geologic unit structure copy northeast quarter clear lake minute topographic map show generalized bedrock unit structure convenience reader locate map feature apparent orthophoto base
