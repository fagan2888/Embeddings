foreword the mission geological survey usgs ass quantity quality earth resource nation provide information assist resource manager policymakers federal state local level make sound decision 
assessment water quality condition trend important part overall mission 
one great challenge face waterresources scientist acquire reliable information guide use protection nation water resource 
that challenge address federal state interstate local water resource agency many academic institution 
these organization collect water quality data host purpose include compliance permit water supply standard development remediation plan specific contamination problem operational decision industrial wastewater water supply facility research factor affect water quality 
additional need water quality information provide basis regional national level policy decision base 
wise decision must base sound information 
society need know whether certain type water quality problem isolate ubiquitous whether significant difference condition among region whether condition change time condition change place place time 
the information use help determine efficacy exist water quality policy help analyst determine need likely consequence new policy 
address need congress appropriate fund usgs begin pilot program seven project area develop refine national water quality assessment nawqa program 
usgs begin full implementation program 
the nawqa program build upon exist base water quality study usgs well federal state local agency 
the objective nawqa program 
describe current water quality condition large part nation freshwater stream river aquifer 
describe water quality changing time 
improve understand primary natural human factor affect water quality condition 
this information help support development evaluation management regulatory monitoring decision federal state local agency protect use enhance water resource 
the goal nawqa program achieve ongoing propose investigation nation important river basins aquifer system refer study unit 
these study unit distribute throughout nation cover diversity hydrogeologic setting 
more two third nation freshwater use occur within study unit two third people serve public water supply system live within boundary 
national synthesis data analysis base aggregation comparable information obtain study unit major component program 
this effort focus select water quality topic use nationally consistent information 
comparative study explain difference similarity observe water quality condition among study area identify change trend cause 
the first topic address national synthesis pesticide nutrient volatile organic compound aquatic biology
