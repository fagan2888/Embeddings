foreword one great challenge face water resource scientist provide reliable water quality information guide management protection nation water resource 
that challenge address federal state interstate local water resource agency academic institution 
many organization collect water quality data host purpose include compliance permit water supply standard development remediation plan specific contamination problem operational decision industrial wastewater water supply facility research advance understanding water quality process 
fact past two decade ten billion dollar spent water quality data collection program 
unfortunately utility data present future regional national assessment limited factor areal extent sample network frequency sample collection vary collection analytical procedure type water quality characteristic determine 
address deficiency congress appropriate fund geological survey begin test refine concept national water quality assessment nawqa program fully implement would 
provide nationally consistent description water quality condition large part nation water resource 
define long term trend lack trends water quality 
identify describe explain possible major factor affect observed water quality condition trend 
presently envision full scale nawqa program would accomplish investigation large set major river basins aquifer system distribute throughout nation account large percentage nation population freshwater use 
each investigation would conduct small team familiar river basin aquifer system 
thus investigation would take full advantage region specific knowledge person area study 
four surface water project three ground water project conduct part pilot program test refine assessment method help determine need feasibility full scale program
