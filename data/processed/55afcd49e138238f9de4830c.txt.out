introduction the hualapai indian reservation study integrate investigation combine geophysical geological study geological survey usgs 
funding study va provide usgs agreement bureau indian affair compile summarize geophysical geological information ass potential mineral resource area 
this report present evaluate result geophysical study make reservation the hualapal indian reservation locate northwest arizona along south rim grand canyon colorado river bile east kingaan arizona mile vest flagstaff arizona fig

road access reservation highway 
the survey area reach several paved unimproved road within reservation 
geologically area study locate southern extent colorado plateau stratigraphic section range mlssissippian redwall limestone triassic chinle formation 
breccia pipe occur within area result solution collapse within redwall liasstone stoplng overlie stratum associate volcanic rock wenrieh usgs mineralisation breccia pipe northern arizona unpub

this mineralisation commonly occur within module concretion associate pyrite goethite within sandstone matrix along feature 
this report present evaluate lts geophysical study without extensive interpretation 
geophysical method till study use multi method geophysical approach determine geophysical characteristic breccia pipe aost diagnostic exploration tool particularly 
coconlno plateau tree cover limit helicopter reconnaissance napping 
variation aagnetite content rock density determine aagnetic gravity field measurement 
sevaral electromagnetic method use measure electrical characteristic breccia pipe surround host rock 
among frequency domain electromagnetic method fdem use vlf low frequency loop loop slingram measurement ami audio magnetotellurics sounding telluric electric field profile 
addition fdem method aost exploration site include time domain electromagnetic idem profile 
complete description vlf electromagnetic method find telford 
the vlf method measure magnetic electrical response vertically polarize radio wave transmit frequency khz one number powerful radio communication station locate around world 
conductivity earth measure site one several factor affect propagation radio wave oves across earth

the theory loop loop electromagnetic method slingram describe detail keller frischknecht mud frischknecht 
field transmit ground coil component field measure several descrete frequency fix distance transmitter coil 
present survey measurement make frequency separation transmitter receiver meter 
lateral change conductivity within meter surface map effectively method 
the theory time domain electromagnetics idem method describe kuo cho 
the idem system measure field secondary induce current transient create ground transmitter loop 
these eddy current set secondary magnetic field detect receiver loop 
since eddy current cease flow instantly transmit current switch decay gradually presence showa decay transient voltage induce receiver loop 
the longer transient voltage persist good conductor 
the tdem system sensitive small conductivity contrast relatively long time period involve method allow great depth exploration vlf slingram method 
exploration depth generally consider two three time loop diameter 
discussion result seven site select geophysical study 
two site think classic example mineralize breccia pipe 
site meter depression choose comparison lack surface mineral trace 
site generally think show stratabound copper miner 
circular drainage around site suggests may collapse breccia pipe
