summary and conclusion the federal water pollution control act public law mandate control salinity along colorado river 
imperial dam standard concentration dissolve solid set environmental protection agency 
plan increase river water use irrigation create concern dissolve solid concentration imperial dam could reach year control salt discharge river initiate 
one method control propose palo verde irrigation district accelerate flush salt soil aquifer periodic excessive irrigation fallow farmland 
feasible method could use diversion colorado river water central arizona project begin 
decrease groundwater soil salinity could reduce amount salt available flushing subsequent year 
this salt reduction could mitigate effect central arizona project diversion river dilute ability thereby aid control river salinity 
the test determine effectiveness excess irrigation method mean salinity reduction conduct acre tract western border palo verde subarea palo verde irrigation district 
the subarea select report one top three contributor salt district colorado river 
the irrigation test although planned month daily irrigation field within test tract proceed accord schedule field simultaneously irrigate 
the test actually proceed consecutive day half tract northern two field test interrupt day discontinuation flow diversion canal annual canal maintenance 
irrigation resume tract day interrupt bank collapse hodges drain 
after day break irrigation resume time central half tract day discontinue permanently extensive bank collapse within hodges drain 
the bank collapse presumed cause increased groundwater discharge drain system 
the discontinuous nature irrigation test result modification approach data analysis attempt could make determine effectiveness excessive irrigation method salinity control 
the northern two field tract consecutive day irrigation take place consider new test area monitor area consider background control area 
data well surround northern two field compare data collect part study area 
summary conclusion 
analysis soil sample collect test irrigation show soil texture salinity vary greatly horizontally vertically within acre tract 
this variation make comparison sample collect test northern two field impossible resampling location could precisely replicate result different sequence soil encounter 
sample site southern two field identically locate sample indicate downward movement salt within soil zone 
change concentration dissolve solid ground water show consistent pattern increase decrease time among well around northern two field tract well within study area 
therefore change mean dissolved solid concentration water well around northern two field compare water well monitor study area 
difference two set well note 
water foot deep well surround northern two field decrease mean dissolvedsolids concentration note last sampling prior first sample test irrigation 
the well foot deep show increase mean dissolve solids concentration period 
the mean dissolve solid concentration well monitor study area show decrease foot deep well period 
these data suggest irrigation northern two field may cause movement salt within soil upper part aquifer low part aquifer monitor test 
comparison water quality characteristic irrigation water solution extract soil sample grind water water hodges drain similarity note among extract certain silty clay ground water several low produce well screen suspected clayey zone water hodges drain 
the study reveal dissolved solid concentration irrigation water average study sodium calcium magnesium sulfate type whereas hodges drain water average sodium chloride sulfate type 
solution extract certain silty clay dissolve solid concentration high sodium sulfate chloride type similar hodges drain water 
water several low produce well either sodium chloride sulfate sodium sulfate chloride type also similar hodges drain water dissolve solid concentration high well shallow 
these data may suggest silty clay zone rich sodium chloride sulfate may contribute large amount salt drain system palo verde subarea 
far test salinity characteristic distribution silty clay within soil aquifer would necessary confirm hypothesis 
because bank collapse hodges drain resulted increase ground water discharge drain system palo verde irrigation district determine irrigation method salinity control practicable within district 
therefore test method plan
