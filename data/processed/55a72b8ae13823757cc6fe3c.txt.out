ihtrcoocticn the dixie valley know geothermal resource area kgra locate westcentral nevada road northeast town fallen 
road access highway nevada state road 
the kgra locate east side stillwater mountain close boundary churchill pershing county northern part dixie valley 
the northern part dixie valley playa 
the humboldt salt marsh lie south playa fig 
the marsh major groundwater discharge area northern dixie valley waibel karst other 
the northern dixie valley basin consist north northeast trend grabens border elongate mountain range stillwater range west clan alpine range east 
the basin asymmetrical deepest portion west side along stillwater range basin fill sediment meter thick measure geothermal well 
the sediment meter thick toward center eastern part valley 
the geology structural history kgra whole dixie valley quite vary complex 
lithologic unit encounter geothermal field range triassic marine sediment recent basin filling sediment 
structural feature affect location geothermal activity include mesozoic thrust late tertiary normal faulting quaternary recent normal fault speed waibel 
funaroles along stillwater rangefront fault one fumarole actively deposit sulfur crystal along numerous hot spring along east side mountain isolate hot spring center valley evidence complex structure area 
geothermal production dixie valley kgra relate extend complex network fault fracture permeability vary physical characteristic rock type waibel 
the temperature geothermal reservoir the power plant kgra begin operation currently produce megawatts electricity geothermal steam benoit 
although many geological study do area dixie valley kgra one geochemical survey prior one describe report 
broad scale grid soil sample juncal bell show anomalous concentration exist along east side stillwater mountain 
anomalous concentration find along fault near playa whereas anomalous concentration find along fault close mountain front 
study usgs soils soil gas plant prove useful distinguish subsurface feature geothermal area 
for example plot elemental suite soil soil gas sample collect near roosevelt hot spring kgra identify fault associate geothermal field sinter deposit element geothermal source adsorb clay along fault nongeothermal detrital element weather adjacent mineral mountain hinkle andcopp press 
sanluis valley colorado multimedia survey include soil gas soil plant identify area unsuspected geothermal heat source may exist also anomaly unrelated geothermal activity erdman other 
this report summarize result soil survey northern dixie valley nevada concentrate dixie valley kgra

the purpose integrate study use elemental suite different medium try distinguish subsurface feature dixie valley geothermal system
