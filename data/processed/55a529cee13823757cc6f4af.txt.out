three dimensional model pre cenozoic basement beneath amargosa desert pahrump valley california nevada implication tectonic evolution water resource richard blakely1 robert morin1 mckee1 kevin schmidt1 victoria langenheim1 gary dixon2 geological survey menlo park geological survey las vega abstract three dimensional inversion gravity data amargosa desert pahrump valley reveals topographically complex pre cenozoic basement surface conceal young sedimentary volcanic deposit 
the amargosa desert underlain deep steep side trough extend southwest nevada volcanic complex nevadacalifornia state line 
the linear margin amargosa desert trough internal topography suggest form series transtensional basin transfer strain right step northwest strike right lateral strike slip fault 
pahrump valley underlie two deep steep side sub basin separate narrow basement ridge align parallel state line 
the pahrump valley sub basin also form transtensional pull apart basin accommodate part displacement along northwest strike state line fault zone 
the state line ridge pahrump valley strike narrow basement ridge beneath ash meadow also lie along state line within state line fault zone 
both ridge associate late cenozoic faulting 
the ridge may form transpressional structure catch slightly askew northwest direct strain form sub basin 
carbonate rock probably compose basement beneath amargosa desert pahrump valley 
because carbonate rock important aquifer region three dimensional aspect conceal basement surface strongly influence ground water flow path transport rate 
for example deeper part amargosa desert trough fault bound western margin trough may impede westward flow ground water carbonate aquifer 
gravity analysis predict water discharge ash meadow originate entirely carbonate flow path north northeast ash meadow whereas water discharge furnace creek originate volcanic flow path north northwest furnace creek 
introduction gravity anomaly basin range geologic province reflect first order sharp contrast high density pre cenozoic rock expose many mountain range low density unconsolidated slightly lithified material fill structural basin 
from gravity measurement take ground surface use density contrast infer certain characteristic underlie pre cenozoic rock even rock conceal beneath younger deposit 
specifically estimate three dimensional shape interface dense basement rock overlie deposit 
many part basin range interface refer basement surface corresponds contact pre cenozoic rock young deposit 
paper provide analysis gravity measurement amargosa desert surround region california nevada 
the flat expanse basins area belie complex basement surface turn reflect complex tectonic evolution part basin range province 
because much basement compose carbonate rock presume principal aquifer lithology region three dimensional view basement surface provide important clue groundwater flow water resource arid region 
geologic and tectonic set the study area figure lie within southern basin range geologic province include town beatty amargosa valley pahrump nevada furnace creek death valley junction shoshone california 
the area center amargosa desert pahrump valley 
these broad relatively flat basin surround mountain range include funeral range bare mountain specter range spring mountain rest spring range nopah range greenwater range

these include fluvial conglomerate sandstone siltstone lacustrine claystone limestone volcanic ash deposit various type local lava flow 
these unconsolidated weakly lithified alluvial deposit significantly low density average pre cenozoic rock form neighbor mountain range 
tertiary volcanism also important evolution southern basin range especially formation large collapse caldera

these new measurement incorporate figure 
first order isostatic residual anomaly reflect sharp contrast highdensity rock typically underlie range low density deposit 
typically fill basin 
large positive anomaly mgal lie funeral range black mountain spring mountain example whereas relatively low value see death valley amargosa desert pahrump valley 
the large negative gravity anomaly mgal northern edge map cause thick low density volcanic deposit southern margin southwest nevada volcanic complex 
use method jachens more separate isostatic residual anomaly two component cause basement rock cause young basin fill deposit 
gravity inversion density basement rock allow vary horizontally whereas density basin fill deposit force increase depth accord specify density depth relationship table

the large 
basement gravity anomaly study area positive anomaly center northern funeral range figure 
here detachment fault ramp upward expose lowerplate rock describe hamilton metamorphose siliceous proterozoic rock 
these rock formerly bury middle crustal depth metamorphose hydrothermally alter typically dense upper plate rock lie elsewhere beneath basement surface detachment surface 
hand sample funeral range latitude longitude 
grain density roughly six seven percent great typical carbonate rock upper plate 
bare mountain also lie within funeral range gravity high figure expose lowerplate rock hamilton density hand sample bare mountain average 
other positive anomaly region may cause similar high density siliceous rock lie relatively shallow depth rock may figure prominently direct flow water region 
subtract thickness basin fill deposit figure topographic elevation provide model three dimensional shape basement surface figure 
this surface complex might predict relatively flat land surface basin 
the basement surface relatively flat shallow around margin basin flat surface interrupt numerous deep steep side sub basin 
pahrump valley example basement surface generally flat lie within land surface throughout basin gentle topography punctuate two prominent laterally restrict sub basin 
the sub basins separate gravity ridge strike northwest parallel kilometer north nevada california state line 
the thickness deposit exceeds southwestern sub basin northeastern sub basin 
both sub basin elongate northwest southeast direction exceptionally steep margin dip range along southwest margin along northeast margin significantly exceed average slope surround mountain range 
the basement surface summit nopah range bottom northeastern pahrump valley sub basin great total relief 
the amargosa desert underlain deep relatively narrow trough extend southward southwest nevada volcanic complex south nevada california state line figure 
here refer feature amargosa desert trough 
basin fill deposit within trough exceptionally deep north latitude often exceed thickness latitude corresponds southern extent southwest nevada volcanic complex figure 
south latitude basin fill typically less thick 
basement ridge cross amargosa desert trough 
parallel slightly north state line approximately strike basement ridge beneath pahrump valley 
like sub basin pahrump valley eastern western margin amargosa desert trough generally linear steep side boundary suggestive tectonic origin 
the linear western margin trough south state line ridge pass west death valley junction example dip linear eastern margin north state line ridge lie west devil hole dip 
important understand limitation gravity inversion data base 
error occur simplify assumption basinbasement model scarcity data location 
moreover basement topography basement gravity calculate regular interval rectangular grid grid value space apart north south east west direction 
this grid spacing establishes limit resolution method 
although shape relative depth basin yield method generally reliable calculated thickness basin fill deposit depend critically density depth function use inversion 
density basin fill deposit kilometer poorly understand detail deep part basin view accordingly 
finally basin depth may error lack understanding basement gravity field 
for example low density pluton directly underlie basin may incorrectly interpret calculation extra accumulation low density deposit basin 
this last problem may special concern north latitude volcanic deposit prevalent 
discussion tectonic evolution the deep steep side sub basin beneath amargosa desert pahrump valley reflect extensional evolution basin range province late tertiary quaternary time 
the linear segmented nature margin internal topography amargosa desert trough pahrump valley suggest fault must important evolution 
the state line fault zone also refer state line fault hewett pahrump valley fault zone wright other hoffard louie other press amargosa river fault zone donovan amargosa fault zone schweickert lahren figure prominently evolution 
this regionally 
extensive right lateral strike slip fault zone part walker lane belt stewart lie less parallel nevada california state line 
topographic feature state line fault zone extend northwest ivanpah valley immediately southeast study area mesquite valley ash meadow may continue along northeastern range front funeral range total distance great figure 
shield other louie other press suggest state line fault may potential rupture length constitute significant seismic hazard city la vega surround community 
wright propose sub basins beneath pahrump valley ash meadows pull apart structure transtensional structure cause right step state line fault zone figure 
follow wright suggest entire amargosa desert trough evolve complex system transtensional basin transfer strain echelon northwest strike right lateral strike slip fault schematically illustrated figure 
the state line fault zone one strike slip element evolution 
this interpretation may seem odds geographic position subbasins pahrump valley ash meadow situate left lateral sense respect state line fault zone 
however geographic position pull apart basin determine primarily location original extensional structure show figure quite possible generate sub basins geographically offset opposite sense respect strike slip displacement 
narrow northwest striking ridge see basement surface pahrump valley ash meadow 
these ridge lie parallel state line clearly associate quaternary faulting location lineament overlie alluvium demonstrate figure 
this association particularly clear pahrump valley hoffard individual fault strand lineament map directly along side state line ridge 
the state line ridge ash meadow pahrump valley nearly strike lie within state line fault zone wright blake other 
the overall strike fault zone roughly parallel state line nearly whereas ridge slightly westerly trend 
believe state line ridge interpret gravity anomaly represent compression feature precenozoic basement either anticlinal fold horst bound reverse fault 
the compression may result slightly westerly orientation intermediate fault within state line fault zone describe caption figure 
water resource carbonate rock believe principal aquifer beneath amargosa desert surround region winograd thordarson laczniak other dettinger mckee 
the basement surface show figure presumably correspond upper surface carbonate rock shape surface important understanding flow ground water region 
two element gravity analysis important regard 
the first cony basement gravity field figure indicate area anomalously high density upper crust 
the large anomaly basement gravity field cause highdensity proterozoic rock expose funeral range describe hamilton metamorphose siliceous rock elevate mid crustal depth 
positive anomaly elsewhere may indicate similar high density rock near land surface rock could impede flow ground water winograd thordarson laczniak other dettinger 
the second element come thickness low density basin fill deposit figure 
basin fill act either aquifer aquitard depend degree compaction sort clay content dettinger 
because degree compaction increase sediment thickness fine sediment clay tend concentrate within basin axis assume deep part cenozoic basins impediment flow ground water 
this assumption support exploratory drilling tracer well near devil hole johnston find significant permeability contrast paleozoic carbonate rock dolomite overlie alluvium 
johnston conclude measured permeability provide low limit overall permeability contrast carbonate aquifer beneath amargosa desert probably permeability two four order magnitude great overlie alluvium johnston 
figure show area dense basement rock deep basin fill predict gravity interpretation figure respectively 
deep basin designate figure large contiguous area basin fill deposit 
basin relatively small areal size one north devil hole designate figure although probably affect water flow 
consider region impediment flow ground water offer suggestion ground water might move subsurface 
the death valley ground water flow system consist two path flow study area north winograd thordarson laczniak other 
eastern path originates system 
carbonate aquifer north east study area western path originates tertiary volcanic rock north northwest study area 
the eastern flow path recharge precipitation spring mountain high mountain range area 
amargosa desert trough act barrier ground water water discharge ash meadow originate northeastern carbonate rock flow path little ground water come western volcanic flow path figure 
hand ground water enter central death valley around funeral range apparently originate western volcanic flow path 
major spring area appear spatially associate state line ridge deep sub basin ash meadow pahrump valley association somewhat different two locale figure 
ash meadow water discharge northsouth alignment spring along eastern margin amargosa desert trough near intersection state line ridge margin trough 
the alignment spring implies amargosa desert trough act barrier westward flow water cause either marked permeability contrast paleozoic carbonate basement overlie cenozoic alluvium one north south fault presumably bound trough margin 
either case water flow westward toward trough depth shallower depth amargosa desert trough approximately would encounter flow barrier trough margin 
apparently barrier move westward flow water surface discharge along north south alignment 
pahrump valley water discharge along northeastern margin state line ridge 
the basement ridge presumably compose carbonate rock therefore could serve conduit ground water move northwest southeast 
perhaps basement ridge pahrump valley act like leaky pipe water flow freely northwest southeast within ridge near topographic surface relative water beneath deep sub basin may promote rise water surface discharge spring lie parallel ridge figure 
more likely reverse fault bound northeastern southwestern margin ridge act barrier groundwater flow 
water reach basement ridge north east may shunt surface 
the clear association pahrump valley spring northeastern margin state line ridge argue interpretation 
basis would predict water abundant along northern margin state line ridge elsewhere pahrump valley 
conclusion geophysical method help define three dimension subsurface structure beneath amargosa desert pahrump valley 
the vast flat expanse basins belie much complex basement topography 
some topographic expression relate tectonism active least recently quaternary time 
believe several sub basin extensional feature develop right step north west striking dextral fault zone 
the basement surface place reflect top carbonate rock aquifer shape surface must figure prominently hydrologic framework region
