also look region respond strong heterospeciﬁc vocalization sound type 
dog region show strong response human either dog nonvocal sound

these ﬁndings provide ﬁrst evidence existence voice area dog nonprimate brain 
the bilateral conspeciﬁc prefer region dog near ventral part caudal extend 
human anterior voice area asts special similarly dog voice area respond strongly conspeciﬁc sound respond strong 
heterospeciﬁc nonvocal sound 
these similarly locate near auditory cortex region thus appear functionally analogous dog human brain 
anterior temporal region imply conspeciﬁc vocalization process nonhuman primate human 
more speciﬁcally region implied voice identity processing key function voice area 
while claim exact anatomical correspondence therefore homology across dog human brain region difﬁcult make beyond scope paper plausible interpretation ﬁndings conspeciﬁc preference auditory region evolutionarily ancient function across mammalian order although convergent evolution alternative 
least result show similarly primate conspeciﬁc vocalization special status dog brain 
human consistent previous report temporal voice area involve anterior region also mid posterior sts 
here show pst mst unlike asts prefer heterospeciﬁc dog sound nonvocal sound 
this suggest psts mst strictly conspeciﬁc speciﬁc rather tune familiar relevant vocal sound general interpretation possibly also support report ﬁnding preference conspeciﬁc compare human vocalization macaque mst 
replicate earlier ﬁndings also find conspeciﬁc preference human right ifc another region imply voice identity processing 
finally find human subcortical mgb previously imply processing rapidly vary spectrotemporal feature human vocal sound respond strong dog sound sound type 
also test series parametric modulation analyse whether emotional valence vocalization reﬂected brain response response modulate acoustical cue

these ﬁndings suggest acoustical cue related vocal emotional valence process similarly dog human auditory cortex 
the involvement relatively early stage processing hierarchy specie indicate valence sensitivity least partly reﬂects sensitivity specie acoustic parameter convey emotion voice 
this consistent early human ﬁndings imply emotional voice sensitive region mst pst process temporal spectral cue 
these discovery suggest extraction emotional information voice important stage vocal emotion process hierarchy support functionally analogous auditory brain region near primary auditory cortex dog human 
these result expand early ﬁndings dog react similarly emotional state change dog human human recruit similar brain region process human animal affective vocalization 
these result also demonstrate right hemisphere dominance vocal emotion processing debate human present dog suggest behavioral lateralization effect dog auditory processing may cause primarily modulation right hemisphere activity 
this fmri study compare ﬁrst time two phylogenetically distant mammalian specie almost identical experimental condition 
our result suggest common function dog human voice processing 
evidence voice area prefer conspeciﬁc vocalization exist primate also dog nonhuman primate human dog voice area involve bilateral region 
this evidence open possibility voice area may longer evolutionary history previously propose date back common ancestor dog humans million year ago although convergent evolution cannot exclude 
also identiﬁed similarly locate near primary auditory cortex region sensitive emotional valence vocalization specie show valence sensitivity involve keep track basic acoustic cue mediate vocal emotion 
this may ﬁrst direct evidence suggest voice process mammalian listener correspond structural functional organization vocalization form basis use key acoustic feature cross speciﬁc call recognition
