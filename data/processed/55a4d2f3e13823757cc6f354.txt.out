introduction famella leave adak alaska july conduct geophysical survey cruise western aleutian arc trench adjacent north pacific seafloor 
the ship arrive study area july operation begin local time gmt 
the survey end august equipment secure gmt vessel transit dutch harbor 
the farnella arrive dutch harbor august 
the cruise cover approximately km2 seafloor amchitka island westward convention line isobath seaward boundary exclusive economic zone 
table list scientific staff 
the principal goal cruise collect overlap long range side scan sonar image gloria system 
other geophysical data collect included line dual channel in3 air gun khz high resolution acoustic reflection khz bathymetry magnetic gradiometer gravitational field 
track line nominally space apart water deeper close shallow water fig 
the track orient parallel subparallel regional morphology structure forearc slope trench 
occasionally severe weather condition force different track orientation 
scientifically cruise resound success 
however cruise plague bad weather faulty gloria cable cause loss day gloria survey time operate time reduced day less day loss 
during pan time gloria inoperative dual channel air gun survey run 
these short survey design investigate specific geologic phenomenon contribute significantly understand geology area 
the gloria image provide significant new data interpret subduction tectonics sedimentologic process geologically complex area

equipment report the khz khz system function well throughout cruise 
the masscomp system air gun dual channel seismic function well occasional problem last two day cruise become inoperative would reboot available software board 
during time analog signal record back hewlitt packard system 
the scientific staff bring new software package dutch harbor system successfully reboot port cruise 
both magnetic gradiometer gravitional field system function well minor problem cruise 
navigation depend heavily gps transit satellite accurate position loran coverage often unreliable survey area 
the northstar system geophysics lab function poorly 
the loran system bridge reliable 
the track line follow display invaluable aid ship officer steer straight course 
weather observation transmit every hour use go xbt system 
xbt cast make least usually twice daily 
the deep cast obtain data xbt cast make heavy sea 
faulty gloria cable cause major problem first part cruise 
the first cable 
failure occur hour commence operation normal failure due severe vehicle pitching 
the splice fail moderate sea 
the replacement cable jump spool tow vehicle deploy severely damage 
this cable replace cable repair previous cruise 
eight hour replacement splice leak ship sail kiska shelter lee island cable repair 
splice repair take hr 
gloria retrieve twice remainder cruise poor sea state 
preliminary scientific result data collect cruise confirm previous interpretation also raise new intriguing question tectonics sedimentology western aleutian arc adjacent north pacific sea floor 
major feature along arc margin canyon indent insular slope aleutian trench narrow accretionary prism landward dip thrust fault irregular discontinuous forearc basin thick accumulation middle series oligocene 
miocene rock south amchitka island 
collision stalemate ridge extinct kula pacific transform fault arc margin cause extreme deformation forearc include formation curvilinear ridge either large fold seafloor expression underlie thrust fault 
the collision narrow trench floor uplifted meter relative part trench 
the shape configuration stalemate ridge attribute change plate motion concurrent asymmetric spread extinct kula pacific ridge 
trap piece early tertiary kula plate exist arc stalemate ridge south agattu island 
uplift bend outer trench wall create fault first tectonic expression oceanic plate subsequent subduetion parallel convergence direction pacific north american plate 
structurally control submarine canyon head shelf summit platform debouch sediment onto trench floor instead terminate forearc basin fill 
thick accumulation sediment 
subtle pathway sediment dispersal see sonographs sediment spill sediment fill forearc basin onto trench floor 
small canyon develop accretionary wedge south amchitka island possibly mass wasting show active channel appear feed fan trench floor 
debris apron wide trench floor evinces mass waste seaward wall trench 
longituidinal channel recognize trench floor 
therefore appear sediment enters far western pan aleutian trench transverely via longitudinally flow turbidity current
