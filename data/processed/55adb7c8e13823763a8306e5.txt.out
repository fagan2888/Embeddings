bedload variability measure bedload transport during constant and slowly changing water discharge condition william carey cyclic variation bedload transport constant water discharge condition inherent part bedload transport process 
although cyclic variation measure extensively laboratory similar information available field measurement 
the exist field data set cyclic variation generally consist small number sample yield little information nature transport cycle 
collect comprehensive field data variation complicate restriction constant slowly change water discharge 
the sand bed channel western tennessee particularly suit type sample tend hold peak discharge period several day recede slowly 
during period sustain peak discharge assume bedload transport equilibrate flow condition measure variability indicative inherent variability transport process 
during day period slowly changing water discharge condition four set bedload sample obtain sample point use standard pound helley smith bedload sampler 
the sample set consist sample 
sample sample set collect consecutively approximate minute interval sample 
water discharge essentially constant sample set vary less percent day period 
individual measure transport rate exhibit large variation one sample next show figure 
these individual rate convert dimensionless rate divide individual set mean rate set 
when dimensionless rate plot cumulative frequency distribution show good agreement theoretical probability distribution derive case ripple dune fig 
number sample increase similarity sample theoretical distribution also increase 
probability distribution sample set closely aprroximate theoretical distribution 
this agreement sample theoretical distribution verify many laboratory investigation field data set sufficient number sample 
plot measure transport rate versus time sample set show peak transport rate seem occur approximately equal interval fig 
this cyclical trend well documented laboratory study show correspond passage dune bedforms 
apply smooth technique data set short term cycle become distinct much long term oscillation appear fig 
this long term oscillation also report laboratory study may

some characteristic fluvial process river william emmett luna leopold robert myrick fluvial process river study extensively united state past year 
this paper relate old study scour fill new study detail data water surface slope bedload transport rate help substantiate early interpretation 
although discussion base data three small river principle involve transfer value river 
reversal maximum value water surface slope riffle low flow pool high flow cause similar reversal maximum value stream power reversal reflect measured value bedload transport rate 
both pool riffle reach likely contribute sediment bedload result generalize scour high flow 
however spatially variable bedload transport rate require reach least available stream power time high transport rate temporarily fill continuity sediment budget maintain 
similarly reach least available stream power time recede river stage become sinks storage move sediment 
this process help explain sort mechanism sediment maintenance pool riffle sequence river 
the volume scour material within annual travel distance average equal annual bedload approximation bed particle move speed travel distance 
scour associate dilation grain bed scour depth individual particle move intermittently speed much less water 
the volume material scour move may large low mean speed downstream entire volume move long reach affect shift downstream limit distance 
measurement bedload discharge nine illinois stream with the helley smith sampler julia graf sample collect helley smith bedload sampler provide useful information transport sand size sediment illinois stream 
bedload sample collect nine site range drainage area mi2 
sample site year sample vermilion river near leonore spoon river near seville moine river near ripley kishwaukee river near perryville green river near geneseo rock river near joslin edward river near new boston henderson creek near oquawka kaskaskia river near venedy station 
the purpose sample program provide information need estimate volume sand size material enter mississippi river two major tributary rock river illinois river 
all stream sample drain flat gently roll terrain 
surficial material drainage basin compose largely unconsolidated sediment deposit process related pleistocene glaciation loess drift till dune sand 
bedrock expose place along stream particularly rock vermilion river 
bed material stream except vermilion river range fine coarse sand 
the vermilion river bed compose primarily granule cobble gravel 
median diameter bed material sample site vermilion river spoon river moine river kishwaukee river green river rock river edward river henderson creek kaskaskia river 
the helley smith sample provide basis bedload discharge rating curve rock kaskaskia river henderson creek 
the sample rock river collect flow range almost peak discharge record yield well define bedload transport curve 
data henderson creek cover much narrow range flow condition show wide scatter 
sample method change year sample period may affect result 
although transport curve develop data additional sampling need obtain reliable curve 
only three measurement define kaskaskia river rating curve cover range flow condition fall straight line 
measure bedload discharge near venedy station much less bedload discharge compute hydraulic channel characteristic suggest reservoir mile upstream site may significant factor reduce bedload 
the possibility extend bedload discharge rating curve develop curve station measurement investigate compare measure bedload discharge bedload discharge compute hydraulic channel characteristic range flow condition 
three theoretical empirical method use computation 
one bedload sample collect spoon kishwaukee edward river 
comparison compute bedload discharge one measure value make possible selection appropriate method compute bedload discharge stream 
one computational method best 
represent bedload discharge stream 
bedload discharge rating curve develop moine river two measure bedload discharge sufficient development rating curve agree well compute bedload discharge 
bedload discharge measure vermilion river sand gravel bedrock bed much low compute bedload discharge 
large bed material grain high flow velocity may interfere operation bedload sampler 
paucity movable bed material also may cause low measure bedload discharge site 
the dominant size bedload stream sample range 
suspend sediment sample stream compose predominantly silt clay size particle less percent sample large sampler bag mesh 
therefore stream bedload sample probably contain little sediment actually travel suspension 
however high percentage sediment less bedload sample may cause significant suspended load size close sampler bag mesh size 
very high percentage sediment less collect green river sample percent suggest fine bed material stream may clog sampler 
because inferred clogging sample use develop bedload discharge rating curve green river 
suspend sediment discharge measure time bedload nine sample 
the fraction total sediment discharge travel within inch bed ranged percent percent 
the bedload fraction low kaskaskia vermilion river percent respectively high kishwaukee rock river henderson creek percent percent percent respectively
