the denison sampler capacity high percentage core recovery unconsolidated material expect constitute primary sample tool firm rock 
practice however denison prove excessively slow 
although yield almost continuous core denison sample disturb engineering testing 
attempt make use normal core drilling face discharge bit instead denison problem encounter include poor sample recovery due flush action cooling water 
variation method use air instead water cool subsequently prove quite satisfactory
