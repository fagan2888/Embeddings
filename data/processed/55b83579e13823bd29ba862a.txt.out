such sequence complex event confine restricted area seem improbable 
second explanation regard gneiss terrane allochthonous postulate represent part basement middle proterozoic sedimentary rock thrust west

such hypothesis would remove local problem explain away presence 
early proterozoic basement south adson creek though would explain presence black lion conglomerate area 
however introduces embarrassment early proterozoic gneiss black lion geometrical relation obviously attributable thrust fault subsequent local downdropping early proterozoic rock everywhere black lion would require 
because gneiss terrane bear geochemical affinity intrusive rock pioneer batholith origin structural position area direct important bearing genesis batholith 
yet third possible explanation allude earlier early proterozoic gneiss terrane black lion conglomerate rock tectonic block though may fault contact present level exposure 
the adson creek fault however may large strike slip component rock sequence two side fault may considerable horizontal separation 
this strike slip component would explain sharp stratigraphic contrast across fault without appeal improbably large local topographic sedimentological difference necessary either two explanation

the age overthrust rock base discordant lead age similar early proterozoic terrane vipond park quadrangle superficial analogy deserves study 
the presence cambrian

recapitulate briefly rock immediately proterozoic sedimentary rock gray jockey peak sequence swamp creek either upper limy member silver hill formation next young hasmark dolomite black lion lower nonlimy member silver hill formation absent 
thus section several hundred meter thick represent low paleozoic clastic sediment miss 
rapid lateral change condition erosion removal sequence swamp creek sheep mountain area tectonism formation troughs receive black lion clastic material maintenance trough sedimentation may occur 
the formation trough may relate graben formation perhaps peripheral early proterozoic highland supply clastic coarsely crystalline feldspar mica rare clast gneiss schist 
this highland exert little effect outside trough area 
this event may part late precambrian rift postulate stewart could relate deposition similar rock sequence near clayton idaho report hobbs other

view trough become progressively fill sediment become finer grain well sorted rich lime section rock become largely carbonate late silver hill time 
time also troughs insignificant topographic feature surround terrane previously include trough still underlie sequence swamp creek become inundated 
hasmark time entire area subtidal intertidal carbonate bank 
this hypothesis would drastically modify early proterozoic gneiss terrane allochthonous rather autochthonous emplace part laramide thrust system 
the problem sedimentation black lion conglomerate lower quartzose noncalcareous member silver hill formation sheep mountain area far south well problem absence north adson creek remain nevertheless pre black lion period erosion would require 
instead system trough could develop preexist middle proterozoic sedimentary base black lion would conformable unexposed sequence swamp creek 
the source crystalline material black lion separate problem source must hide young rock 
yet third possibility course adson creek defines major high angle fault 
large horizontal movement along fault could bring rock either side juxtaposition original site deposition black lion conglomerate may far sequence swamp creek 
the relation early proterozoic gneiss black lion conglomerate remain separate problem autochthonous thrust hypothesis permissible 
the presence chrome mica bear green quartzite pebble conglomerate lens low member silver hill hecla could bear subject 
the size pebble suggest source far away nature clast suggest source unlike black lion conglomerate 
the chromemica bear quartzite lithic match early proterozoic facer formation willard thrust area northern utah describe crittenden sorensen 
that source seem far away upon restoration thrust would wrong direction since hecla source direction consistently south southeast
