discussion this map fourth series show distribution composition age early middle cenozoic volcanic center western conterminous united state 
the map design primarily data base igneous system major geologic environment relate host mineral deposit 
the data show provide basic information necessary derivative study identification assessment igneous related mineral deposit mineralize system 
addition map series show temporal spatial relationship early middle cenozoic igneous rock geochemical age association single common scale within many different igneous center western state 
this map series also use base study volcanology volcanotectonics general geology volcanic relate rock 
regional compilation other example sherrod smith smith walker macleod walsh other principal source reference original source use also consult whenever wherever possible construction map 
however area meager data composition age igneous rock arbitrarily interpret 
this procedure necessary order resolve internal problem maintain standard treatment meaningful comparison data throughout map series

recent comprehensive review literature pertain laramide time late cretaceous early eocene miller other armstrong ward post laramide time christiansen yeats particularly important series map discuss magmatic event early middle tertiary geologic evolution western north america

this simplistic rock classification desirable detailed volcanological purpose emphasize dominant rock type within give region although specific area several rock type may intermix
