while establish boundary line survey party map topographically strip land extend less mile side line total width average probably less mile 
this topographic mapping extend westward chitina valley include chitina glacier mountain slope along chitina river far west canyon creek 
the mapping reconnaissance kind similar do united state geological survey many part alaska much value geologic survey carry 
the survey make whose result give bulletin undertaken extend imowledge geology nizina district would cover region lie chitina valley extend eastward international boundary investigate mineral deposit area survey particularly trace nikolai greenstone chitistone limestone principal copper beam rock low chitina valley determine eastern limit distribution 
plan cross chitina river investigate report placer prospect kiagna river first large southern tributary chitina tana river plan carry high water july early august make cross river exceedingly dangerous horse 
the topographic map prepare international boundary commission represent mountain slope adjacent chitina river branch chitina glacier

young creek occupies typical glacial valley broad shape cross section 
the upper part stream form union two short fork little mile long flows flood plain low brush cover gravel bench 
below big bend stream turn west right angle upper course young creek intrench valley floor cut rather wide canyon grow deep deeper downstream mile calamity gulch attain depth foot 
from point westward canyon become broad shallow till creek reach bar nizina river 
the dominant bedrock young creek valley black shale cut many dike sill light color granitic rock cap high mountain side valley conglomerate sandstone 
there also bed limestone many limestone concretion 
except small area sandstone near big bend numerous bedrock exposure along creek shale intrude dike 
the gravel deposit young creek three class highbench gravel lie well stream level form part canyon wall low bench gravel adjoin creek channel within canyon flood plain gravel stream flow time high water 
addition deposit doubtless transport deposited chiefly run water rate water ice thin veneer morainal debris find throughout valley even mountain top 
this deposit make material large part foreign young creek without doubt transport long distance much upper chitina valley 
the flood plain gravel require little description already give 
they young gravel deposit derive largely bench gravel might well consider appear everywhere along stream take first 
they gravel 
economic geology 
stream likely flow time high water 
some may difficult distinguish low bench gravel general unlike practically bare vegetation 
their depth know reason believe shallow especially within canyon 
their conspicuous constituent boulder granite greenstone resistant rock bring valley glacier 
they contain however much local material particularly sandstone conglomerate porphyry 
the soft shale weather easily rapidly therefore less noticeable flood plain deposit harder rock 
most boulder flood plain gravel concentrate bench gravel although doubtless derive directly bedrock 
the low bench deposit old flood plain gravel stand high enough stream free attack avaters except lateral undermining 
such deposit lie along young creek canyon 
they range height less foot foot cover timber vegetation 
within canyon low bench prominent first one side creek channel swing back forth rock wall 
the high bench gravel lay clown present canyon young creek form 
they occupy floor wide valley great lateral extent low bench floodplain gravel much deeper 
place wall canyon creek cut gravel bedrock beneath show depth several hundred foot 
these high bench gravel contain much material evidentty glacial origin foreign valley mingle shale local rock neighbor hill 
they probably deposit upper part young creek valley still occupy ice 
highly important fact remember high bench gravel occur low part young creek valley calamity gulch evidence find indicate ever present upper part valley 
the economic importance statement lie fact placer nizina district young creek properly belongs form reconcentration gold bench gravel trench stream bench gravel probably little gold 
however gravel young creek contain gold reason stream stake held future development 
the gold associate native copper native silver believe brought 
upper chlltna valley alaska 
place outside young creek valley 
not enough prospect yet do show clearly distribution copper silver know whether metal occur gravel head young creek 
find quantity doubtless less low stream probably find west fork 
large part work do prospect stream gravel quickly efface stream 
though assessment work do many year claim along young creek stream gravel low bench gravel show little evidence disturb miner 
such work do various place 
three mile calamity gulch small area bench gravel foot creek sluice find contain little gold great many small concretion marcasite derive black shale canyon cut 
tunnel driven high bench gravel place year ago reveal many boulder inclose gravel glacial silt gold 
say gold find roof tunnel bedrock 
about mile calamity gulch work do shale bench within canyon foot level creek 
the gravel deposit form canyon intrench old low bench adjoin creek flow shallow canyon within canyon 
little gold together silver copper recover gravel enough make mine profitable fact work do mean prospect ground 
little prospect carry near head calamity gulch deep gash black shale north side young creek 
the stream gulch load debris carry rapid erosion country rock though gold find gravel recovery difficult small quantity water gulch 
rest young creek little attempt make work necessary hold claim 
the bedrock young creek valley chititu creek include eex white creek gravel deposit different 
only low part young creek calamity gulch enrichment stream gravel concentration gold scatter bench deposit expect gravel may present upper valley sweep ice replace ice retreat 
young creek favorably situate regard transportation short distance railroad advantage good supply timber water

the principal obstacle either railroad wagon road cross nizina eiver chitina river necessary 
the trail use go chitina either steep soft wet many place

travel away main valley difficult extremely rugged topography presence glacier nearly tributary valley 
the climate however favorable mine many part interior alaska summer longer less protected place
