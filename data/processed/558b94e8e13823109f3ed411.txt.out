the american people vitally interested oil gas resource united state 
industry enormous one involve hundred million dollar capital oil gas take together rank third value among country mineral product principally petroleum product play large apparently indispensable part civilization 
difficult imagine modern life without gasoline kerosene vaseline mineral lubricating oil host petroleum derivative 
yet american public squarely face fact oil field unite state 
petroleum withdrawal and restoration 
mean inexhaustible 
purpose predict life supply discus estimate life among men study situation vary fifteen hundred year 
sufficient point field produce uniformly large quantity oil long period enormous amount oil take known field day year year chance discover large new field become less 
whether failure field come fifteen year fifty hundred fifty bound come come result may serious 
sure failure gradual give time adjustment increase production latin america likely offset diminish domestic supply time oil distil shale rocky mountain region may supply market 
but factor may minimize defer final event fact remain nation far poor oil gas field exhaust 
question preserve supply come generation expense 
posterity without present generation need wisely use 
but day careful indeed l waste morrow need unwisely use morrow could put good service 
how oil situation public land state 
under law force operator drill oil l lose land produce l neighbor drain production exceed market demand last year 
the result 
first large quantity oil storage volatile valuable constituent lose 
estimate california example value oil lose evaporation perhaps per cent value total production well for let emphasized loss represent valuable part oil 
second price reduce point oil use fuel without separate constituent great intrinsic value us 
the heavy part many oil best adapt use steam fuel burn lighter part boiler put limited resource use far low maximum capability 
and let emphasized loss represent valuable part oil 
thus one great asset american people part dissipate produce advance demand use unwisely 
already suggested loss due overproduction overproduction due large measure law encourage force 
read chapter oil land law see show uncertain man tenure mclaughlin petroleum industry california california state min 
purpose the withdrawal 
make actual discovery oil 
therefore regardless market transportation condition regardless sell price oil drill discovery well 
then law cut field tract small one tract may almost wholly drained well surround drill well regardless whether dispose oil advantageously order prevent neighbor take 
may profit would greatly increased leave oil ground month year may farsighted enough regret waste result premature production law demand discovery restricts acreage prohibits free choice force produce 
not unlikely one neighbor haste must drill let water oil sand perhaps ruin area loss thousand barrel oil 
would prefer slowly study relative location water oil horizon field develop maximum amount oil might obtain oil land law tend encourage prudent careful development 
must drill drill quickly drill continuously 
under condition law single expedient inevitable operation must suspend far possible adequate law provide 
merely urge passage new law allow old one operate 
time congress could act damage would do beyond repair 
the public domain never repossess reconsolidated disposed small tract 
every day placer law mean location small claim 
the solution suspend operation placer law land believe valuable oil gas 
such consideration require justify oil withdrawal day 
such consideration 
then think fuel supply navy dominant need believe least partly cover two 
naval reserve california one wyoming 
but read letter november see september see 
show along question naval supply question ultimate public interest necessity immediate action 
emergency strong even severe measure justify 
the withdrawal order september draft sign 
that severe measure one attempt deny 
without forewarn without precedent knock breath moment california oil industry

the geologist recommend prepare withdrawal order ignorant careless hardship may cause 
many western men personally familiar field consideration know people know sacrifice may make risk may incur hope may entertain striking oil geologist regret keenly development west may action measure retard 
yet without hesitation exception recommend interest public make paramount 
the temporary character withdrawal strongly emphasize

history the withdrawal 
the first official report occurrence oil public domain seem january letter commissioner general land office register receiver humboldt cal

how long suspension continue apparent data hand seem nothing sort 
the event two succeed year afford strike illustration inadequate protection give placer law oil prospector period prior discovery

history the withdrawal 
quiescent period follow one restoration six 
one early withdrawal order cancel another involve several township leave outstanding 
both territory prove oil bearing 
meanwhile survey geologist work california field become impressed need oil operator protection agricultural filing drill period 
thus happen within less three month restoration land office large area would appear good reason exists suspension land well ther area withdraw department recommendation geologist familiar situation 
additional withdrawal california recommend survey approve department early peti tion oil company result withdrawal oregon area northwestern louisiana withdrawn recommendation survey prevent waste natural gas 
these withdrawal except louisiana make purpose earlier land office order essentially similar scope sontewhat fortunate fate 
they closely confine prospective oil territory probably include less agricultural land number oil operator benefit greatly increase large coal phosphate withdrawal accustom public withdrawal idea perhaps important field examination view classification carry rapidly fund available would permit 
the land show geological survey nonoil promptly restore offering possibility oil retain withdrawal 
this situation summer 
the withdrawal time outside louisiana aim mainly scrippers oil homesteader flock field file land little agricultural value hope either obtain title valuable oil land force oil operator buy 
thus withdrawal prohibit agricultural entry selection permit mineral location immediate extraction oil promote rather retarded 
this first glance appear excellent producer production begin outrun demand situation become serious

the question raise order valid 
many among lawyer prominence argue inconsiderable number operator act assumption 
thereupon president ask congress set doubt rest definitely give executive authority make withdrawal congress respond act june stat
