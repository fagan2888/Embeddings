gold pan concentrate sout alamance county central north carolina john agostino robert schmidt introduction the major hill sutphin area gold miner identify panned concentrate survey carolina slate belt central north carolina 
locate area several small gold prospect work past small scale gold pan stream may widespread carry limited extent today however find reference past present gold production geologic literature 
the area partly wholly within part snow camp major hill hydrothermal alteration system major zone siliceous high alumina hydrothermal alteration type know contain minable gold ore localities slate belt 
part alteration system near snow camp pyrophyllite mine describe schmidt 1985b 
study define major hill sutphin mineralize zone particular stream sediment sample program describe part large research project test application satellite remote sense mineral exploration 
consequently many person involve develop idea lead selection area evaluation stream sediment sample include especially

study pyrophyllite deposit snow camp mine much extensive associate hydrothermal alteration begin brief visit november follow several visit schmidt klein other subsequent year 
examination variety map image make process landsat multispectral scanner thematic mapper data lead conclusion total area hydrothermal alteration probably much great formerly suspect 
field study prove desirability detail mapping stream sediment sample realize 
partial mapping carry sample survey describe conduct april june 
the stream sediment sample survey design complete day test large area possible hence sampling confine site close public road 
result large area northwest west south sutphin near center study partly surround drainage yield gold pan concentrate remains untested first stage study 
result phase survey still incomplete partial result take together may interest explorationists therefore decision make make available preliminary form 
sample procedure use pan concentrate make follow standardized procedure use inch gold pan 
each sample consist pan roughly level full approximately dry weight volume 
wet sample weigh per pan 
stream sediment generally pan stream take soil place plastic sack carry convenient stream process 
the result concentrate place plastic bag return laboratory drying examination microscope

regional geology the carolina slate belt complex area late precambrian cambrian volcanosedimentary epiclastic volcanic rock extend central georgia southern virginia 
snow camp region wide consist intermediate metavolcanic rock lesser area mudstone few felsic mafic metavolcanic rock 
several granitic pluton subvolcanic porphyry dike probably widely different age intrude slate belt rock area 
hydrothermal alteration many large zone intense hydrothermal alteration present carolina slate belt north carolina describe schmidt 1985a klein schmidt sexauer 
these zone typically several kilometer dimension undergone extensive leaching alkalis introduction silica part system 
sericitization widespread area mica paragonite 
peripheral area may undergo much propylitic alteration distinguish pervasive greenschist facies regional metamorphism 
intensely altered part system lenses pod pipe alumina rich mineral mixed quartz form 
many exploit pyrophyllite pyrophyllite andalusite rock 
the metal gold silver copper molybdenum tin arsenic occur small amount many alter zone north carolina gold find minable quantity 
the occurrence metal deposit associate type alteration part world discuss schmidt 1985a 
presence type alteration consider favorable gold exploration region carpenter allard schmidt 1985a klein schmidt 
the snow camp alteration system large one extend northeastward several wide 
the altered rock resistant weather tend form hill monadnocks 
the width alteration well define eastward extent along several narrow shear zone yet know 
the intensely alter part system almost entirely replaced quartz form quartz granofels place accompany pyrophyllite andalusite pyrite 
siliceous breccia contain magnetite specular hematite widespread mostly east side quartz granofels hill 
narrow shear zone commonly hydrothermally alter contain small amount sulfide extend northeastward quartz granofels hill along lineament several kilometer 
brecciation braxton gold prospect may associate zone 
pyrophyllite andalusite sericite main mineral commodity produce map area 
several prospect metallic mineral locate though none record geologic literature believe gold 
silver copper mine small deposit outside map area north area west map prospect copper carpenter 
not much know way gold occur mapped area assume similar gold occurrence pilot mountain randolph county 
there gold mine especially fracture zone quartz vein also disperse widely siliceous quartz sericite alter volcanic rock 
gold detect fireassay analysis unnamed shaft east major hill sample occur mass iron oxide boxworks white vein quartz braxton prospect iron oxide take narrow brecciate zone 
visible gold note sample submit prospect 
the source gold pan concentrate probably vein widespread dissemination within drainage basin zone intense hydrothermal alteration may restrict vein shear outside big alteration zone 
all gold particle see less size 
unfortunately east boundary alteration less well defined area pan concentrate contain gold near major hill part perimeter 
stream sediment sample program program collect stream sediment pan concentrate design test mineral potential especially gold potential entire snow camp alteration system 
april june possible john agostino carry sample part site select sample collect test drainage part system 
addition stream sediment soil gold prospect adjacent prospect concentrate pan 
result microscopic examination pan concentrate show accompany map table 
visual identification andalusite gahnite confirm

chemical analysis sediment complete report later 
discussion result though sample program far complete data hand collect variety purpose spectrographic pan concentrate fire assay analysis present table represent considerable amount geochemical information interpret tentative fashion 
visible gold pan concentrate gold detect fire assay result distinctly limited area north east major hill 
most gold bearing sample far take within intensely hydrothermal alter zone sample 70c 72c braxton prospect sample east zone may relate narrow zone alter rock along northeast trending shear 
the andalusite sample 70c suggest hydrothermal alteration within drainage basin though aware 
the complete absence visible gold concentrate southwest half intensely alter zone surprise result consider significant though present unexplained 
metal value gold rock soil restrict narrow shear zone large main zone hydrothermal alteration seem show particular trend 
small anomalous amount molybdenum ppm tin ppm arsenic ppm present many sample throughout area table except molybdenum lacking sample gold bear prospect sample 
significant silver analysis ppm obtain three sample number sulfide bearing quartz sericite rock along shear gossan sample two prospect number 
conclusion the occurrence visible gold pan stream sediment concentrate rather clearly delimit area together analyse sample take dump old prospect suggest major hill sutphin area favorable economic mineral evaluation 
the close association indication large area hydrothermal alteration silica rich high alumina type consider favor area
