once organic rich sediment deposit preserved organic matter convert hydrocarbon biological chemical process 
the occurrence type oil gas hydrocarbon related different origin within three stage petroleum generation thermal maturation organic matter immature biological process shallow depth accumulate sediment generate gas consist chiefly methane mature thermal cracking process generate liquid hydrocarbon oil high molecular weight gas post mature gas mostly methane generate destruction liquid hydrocarbon higher molecular weight gas conversion organic matter carbon rich residue volatile compound response increasingly severe thermal cracking 
thermal cracking process control temperature depth burial geologic time 
the relationship factor discuss hunt 
various method employ determine stage hydrocarbon generation level maturation organic matter study area 
these technique briefly discuss burial temperature history vitrinite reflectance carbon isotope ratios natural gas burial temperature history maturation level may estimate reconstruct burial temperature history area assume past present temperature gradient similar 
study area present temperature gradient per use average surface temperature 
for cretaceous rock mature stage occur approximately corresponds depths burial range study area 
the mature stage paleozoic rock generally take place within temperature range coincide burial depth range study area 
the mature stage jurassic rock lie somewhere range 
because cretaceous sequence approximately thick study area jurassic old rock bury deep enough generated hydrocarbon mature stage 
with added thickness mississippian carbonate source bed upper devonian low mississippian bury least place low part mature stage 
burial depth paleozoic may underestimate pennsylvanian permiam triassic rock may cover study area erode jurassic sedimentation 
this burial temperature history complicate increased pressure temperature associate early tertiary deformation burial beneath thrust plate 
hoffman hower aronson conclude cretaceous shale mineralogy northern disturb belt result heating temperature range 
thus although burial depth early tertiary orogeny indicate jurassic old rock mature probably generated oil increase temperature associate thrust faulting may increase maturity level entire stratigraphic section
