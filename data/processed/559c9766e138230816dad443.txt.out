geochemical prospect the present investigation broader scope earlier work entire area cover broad spectrum mineral rather spot investigation gold 
most area eastern half bir bayda1 quadrangle accessible car visit area show evidence miner sample trace element analysis 
complete aerial photo coverage area available prove indispensible planning route select target spot examination ground 
feature visible car accessible car could thus examine provide good coverage area 
the geologic feature possible economic significance could locate aerial photograph fault fault intersection dike granitic mafic intrusive contact bleach area unusually dark area 
additional feature look traverse small show photographs vein gossan zone subtle color variation iron stain disseminate pyrite 
the location sample take trace element analysis show accompany map 
the sample wadi sediment 
the size fraction take mesh 
most sample take wadis small drainage basin well control source material 
place wadi sediment sample satisfactory rock sample take directly vein altered rock 
the rock sample show map discuss 
the sample take test feature opinion show promise contain economic mineral 
certain large area unsampled sparsely sample think little worth sample 
example large area without sample region underlie schist gneiss southeast wadi rabigh 
area underlie mrslf conglomerate give sparse sample density 
this procedure seem justified area underlain schist gneiss uniformly low trace element content sample take elsewhere belt 
the conglomerate however contain slightly anomalous amount copper boron sample take along fault 
trace secondary copper mineral see one locality andesite flow interbedded conglomerate vein dike granite contact rock appear barren possibility find minable deposit seem poor 
the wadi sediment rock sample analyze spectrographically trace amount element ministry petroleum mineral resource laboratory jiddah charles thompson geological survey analyst 
the location significance anomalous value various element discuss follow paragraph 
threshold value element determine method suggest hawkes webb sample whose analysis rise threshold discuss 
silver anomalous amount find three rock sample come small area west wadi jarasah near north border map 
this within large area recommend detailed study 
silver may indicator base metal deposit 
boron anomalous amount occur two wadi sample take along northeasttrending fault conglomerate south map area

manganese anomalous amount occur gabbro ring structure wadi hayyan associate high cobalt zinc 
molybdenum useful guide geochemical prospecting 
the anomalous sample show map 
most gabbro ring structure wadi hayyan area east 
nickel stream sediment use successfully prospect nickel deposit hawkes webb 
take four wadi sample small area south bayda contain abnormal amount nickel 
the rock area granitic intermediate composition unusual nickel normally associate mafic rock 
omalous nickel together chromium also occur small gabbro southwest bayda 
titanium anomalous amount occur varied environment 
sample hornblende rich gneiss contains titanium molybednum 
another amphibolite northwest bayda1 
other sample anomalous titanium gabbro ring structure wadi hayyan may expect 
vanadium appear high anomalous sample high titanium principally gabbro ring structure amphibolite wadi jarasah 
zinc occur anomalous amount gabbro ring structure show map 
sample contain high background zinc also show 
the result mineral reconnaissance encouraging 
the belt northwest trend fault uniformly low metal content 
find crystal kyanite small mass kyanite sericite schist find indication workable deposit 
area contain anomalous trace amount base metal element include gabbro diorite ring structure wadi hayyan near north edge map extend east southeast wadi jarasah 
small body massive magnetite occur ring structure 
they range size hundred thousand ton magnetite appear numerous near border ring structure 
fault cut ring structure north map area trace secondary copper mineral find along fault 
recommend additional work area 
the ring structure could target airborne magnetometer survey search large body magnetite adjacent area east could examine sample detail possible presence base metal ore deposit 
quartz vein kilometer northwest bayda contains numerous limonite fill cavity 
sample vein show markedly anomalous trace element content silver beryllium molybdenum lead
