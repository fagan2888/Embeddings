evidence sea ice impact icy reef beaufort sea coast erk reimnitz 
recent investigation ice impact along alaskan coast kovacs global synopses phenomenon kovacs sodhi sodhi kovacs distinction make rideup sheet ice may smoothly slide landward across beach beyond distance much thereby generally conform surface land pileup icesheet buckle crumble seaward edge bottom fast ice 
this ice failure result pile broken ice high wide much come rest beach 
either iceimpact phenomenon likely occur fall spring within minute commonly leave scar one form another along stable coastline may preserve decade 
although ice movement onto shore frequent regional scale unpredictable particular site may liken year flood sodhi kovacs 
ice rideup surficial scraping process mostly frozen ground unlikely arrested place repeatedly commonly result mound ridge sediment terminus produce feature high wider ice sheet thickness generally much less therefore unlikely raise elevation barrier island 
rideup produce ridge mound consist material scrap largely beach surface tundra therefore may include driftwood soil vegetative mat 
ice pileup hand recur narrow zone commonly contain large amount sand gravel shoreface disperse throughout pile event therefore result broad sediment mound high see barn reimnitz volume 
either case natural scar easily datable attempt make previously learn frequency severity ice encroachment fate manmade object along coast 
the present study attempt gain knowledge object place icy reef poorly know part beaufort sea coast 
the knowledge become useful future development area 
icy reef arcuate gravel barrier island wide extend along shore arctic national wildlife range south margin beaufort sea fig 
the island separate kongakut river delta lagoon several hundred meter wide generally shallower the icy reef set unusual several reason the central part lagoon seasonally occupy large naled river ice harden other never melt 
with unbroken length crestal elevation icy reef long high barrier island beaufort sea 
other typical barrier island high barn reimnitz volume 
the gravelly crest hummocky relief oppose smooth overwash shape nature barrier 
the central long stretch icy reef remain essentially unchanged outline fig 
arctic coastal feature undergo remarkable change reimnitz other 
because unique character set believe much knowledge gain previous study lagoon barrier island prudhoe bay area cannot apply icy reef 
thirteen tower erect along icy reef navigational control hydrographic survey coast geodetic survey fig 
most tower position triangulation station generally place high elevation barrier islands several meter landward 
the edition chart show eight survey target destroy either 
systematic count conduct since believe none survey tower remain standing time 
august visit triangulation station easy establish fig 
the monument describe standard disk top iron pipe project ground 
the reference mark rm1 rm2 iron pipe locate within east south easy wooden inch witness post near rm1 department commerce 
remains tower report near site department commerce neither easy reference mark could find time 
during visit find easy rm1 remain witness post fig 
they locate toe subdue erosion scarp high seaward hummocky crest island 
the base bent rm1 stump witness post vertical obviously place 
the sharp bend pipe level break sound wooden post indicate resist landward shear force hold surface frozen sediment rather loose gravel exists summer 
the shear plane slightly present beach surface meter present crest island 
rm1 bent toward base tall wooden tower distant topple tower point direction rm1 suggest destroy type event 
geologic study alaska geological vey 
most survey tower place beach barrier island beaufort sea around destroy hundred year storm surge reimnitz maurer whereas kinds tower remain stand high bluff barrow peard bay along chukchi sea coast 
this fact suggest destruction neither strong wind combine icing wind 
storm wave carry log believe responsible destruction site two reason tower lie close original location ground freeze indicate destruction freezeup cessation wave action 
thus sea ice likely damage tower triangulation station easy within year construction 
suspect tower destroy icy reef shortly construction meet similar fate 
the inability recover marker around easy rediscovery present crest icy reef suggest station bury sometime exhume erode sea since 
the hummocky crest icy reef buildup gravel oppose level modern beach suggest sea ice encroachment add gravel island 
the stratigraphy gravel deposit expose scarp easy suggests repeat deposition rework barn reimnitz volume 
because ice rideup subaerial scraping process unlikely arrested place repeatedly cannot raise general elevation barrier island 
ice pileup hand commonly contain shoreface derive sand gravel melt remains broad gravel mound 
our evidence thus indicate much old stable central part unusual barrier island repeatedly impact elevated ice pileup last year 
photograph triangulation station easy bent iron pipe rm1 broken witness post seaward face icy reef august 
place along high part island marker first damage ice bury gravel ice pileup finally exhume sea 
ice pileup apparently deposit least gravel top barrier island since 
note long karluk scale 
our intrigue significant finding ice pile important sediment supply mechanism arctic beach barrier island result net accretion coast stable 
ride hand geologically less important contributes little sediment 
this investigation also show comprehensive study datable artifact along poorly know stretch arctic coast provide much insight ice hazard coastal process
