abstract extensive lead geochemical anomaly well several small anomaly copper molybdenum zinc find large area alter volcanic intrusive rock south summitville mining district 
these geochemical anomaly together geologic similarity productive summitville district make area attractive exploration 
introduction geologic geochemical study large area highly alter rock volcanic intrusive center around sumn1itville lookout mountain eastern san juan mountain reveal possible exploration target near looko mountain 
this area investigate part heavy metal program geological survey ass resource potential metal deposit 
summitville produce significant quantity gold silver copper mineralize volcanic plug currently develop mining 
other area south widely prospect production negligible 
the geologic similarity sumn1itville district area around lookout mountain south suggest reconnaissance geochen1ical hydrothermal alteration study lookout mountain area n1ight reveal evidence presence hidden ore deposit 
geology the area study underlain thick series lava flow represent several distinct period volcanic activity 
the lowermost widespread flow part conejos formation oligocene old age

rock alteration large mass alter rock form northern side upper alamosa creek valley include lookout mountain fig 
extends northeast trend area n1iles long mile wide lie roughly astride contact volcanic rock northwest quartz n1onzonite southeast 
the large dike small body quartz latite porphyry intrude volcanic rock also alter 
the altered rock exceptionally well expose rugged east slope lookout mountain 
hydrothermal activity one two stage convert original drab color flow intrusive rock conspicuous white yellow red mass consist largely quartz kaolinite illite 
rock along wide belt include large quartz latite porphyry dike south east lookout mountain alter predominantly quartz alunite pyrophyllite 
this assemblage consider represent advanced stage hydrothermal alteration wide 
spread quartz kaolinite illite assemblage general parallelism quartz alunitepyrophyllite rock dike suggest genetically relate dike 
geochemical anomaly more rock sample collect throughout area alter rock fig

chemical analysis sample indicate zone anomalously high content lead n1olybdenum copper zinc fig 
neither gold silver detect sample area around lookout mountain limit detection analytical method use ppm part per million gold ppm silver 
trace appreciable amount 1netals detect sample summitville area 
the pronounced geochemical anomaly group east lookout mountain 
lead anomaly nearly mile long much mile wide encloses large quartz latite porphyry dike overlap ento quartz monzonite southeast 
within anomalous area sample contain ppm lead 
the lead anomaly cover roughly parallel southeastern part zone quartz alunite pyrophyllite alteration extend adjacent part zone quartz kaolinite illite alteration 
small anomaly molybdenum copper zinc peripheral lead anomaly 
this arrangement metal anomaly suggest lead less mobile surface environment may accumulate closely around locus miner whereas copper molybdenum zinc easily move rock thus deposit far center 
comparison with the summitville district the area alter rock discuss report mile south summit 
ville district similarity two area geologic relation alteration pattern geochemical anomaly noteworthy 
area rock alteration concentrate vicinity intrusive body volcanic plug 
the gold silver copper miner summitville center strongly alter rock plug coarsely porphyritic quartz latite steven ratte lithologically resemble large dike east lookout mountain 
vithin plug miner closely confine zone quartzalunite alteration within wide body weakly alter rock 
area anomalously high lead content enclose mineralize zone summitville local area high zinc molybdenum content peripheral area high lead content 
conclusion the geologic relation alteration pattern geochemical anomaly indicate area east lookout mountain deserve careful consideration exploration target 
the area around northeast end lead anomaly seem favorable inasmuch geochemical anomaly metal also occur 
view possible secondary migration metal downhill topographically high part target area near porphyry dike test first
