abstract united state produce million ton phosphate rock percent world production substantial amount export phosphate rock chemical fertilizer 
during kst decade prediction make easily minable low cost reserve phosphate rock would exhaust end century instead major exporter phosphate rock unite state might become net importer 
most analyst today however think export indeed decline next one two decade resource phosphate sufficient supply domestic need long time future 
what happen future depend actual availability low cost phosphate rock reserve unite state world 
realistic understanding future phosphate rock reserve dependent accurate assessment national phosphate rock resource 
many different estimate resource exist none alike 
the detailed analysis past resource estimate present report indicate estimate differ estimate much think exist 
the phosphate rock resource classification use herein base two fundamental aspect mineral resource degree certainty existence feasibility economic recovery 
the comparison past estimate include available company data combine writer personal knowledge indicate billion metric ton identify recoverable phosphate rock exist united state billion metric ton think economic marginally economic 
the remain billion metric ton mostly northwestern phosphate district idaho consider subeconomic minable increase price phosphate occurs 
more billion metric ton probably exist southeastern coastal plain phosphate province principally florida north carolina offshore shallow atlantic ocean north carolina southern florida 
this resource considerd hypothetical base geologic inference combine sparse drilling data 
total resource phosphate rock united state sufficient supply domestic demand foreseeable future provide drill do confirm hypothetical resource chemistry deposit determine 
mine beneficiation technique modify improved new technique develop deposit profitably exploit 
introduction the united state produce million metric ton phosphate rock percent world production 
about percent production export percent phosphate rock percent manufacture fertilizer chemical 
the remainder use domestically largely percent fertilizer animal feed supplement produce agricultural product bureau mine 
significant portion agricultural product export phosphate rock go portion export indirectly 
thus phosphate export directly indirectly value contribute positively balance international payment 
although marketable value phosphate rock produce billion total value agricultural chemical product depend phosphate rock input many time 
the continued ability phosphate industry supply low cost phosphate rock export domestic consumption clearly major importance nation 
during last decade people question whether national endowment phosphate rock ground sufficient support national phosphate industry far next century 
report government account office use information largely produce company bureau mine project significant decline export phosphate mid forecast nation would become net phosphate import country first quarter next century 
this decline report say would cause exhaustion high grade easily mine beneficiate phosphate reserve northwestern phosphate province idaho adjacent state montana wyoming utah 
importantly southeastern phosphate province florida north carolina 
these two province presently produce percent production contain minor portion nation phosphate resource 
possible result significant decline export would greatly strengthened world market position possible cartel phosphate export country large resource phosphate rock could exploit low cost 
this presumably would occur deposit could extract low cost exhaust 
rise world phosphate price could expect agricultural sector force rely import high price fertilizer would weaken 
addition people fear prospect weaken national phosphate resource position might result export restriction phosphate rock phosphate product near future 
furthermore deteriorate phosphate industry would weaken position regard allocation railroad roll stock environmental regulation severance taxation policy like 
analyst bureau mine think scenario unlikely 
their current forecast william stowasser write commun export phosphate rock decline decade 
the reason decline cite analyst include increase cost produce phosphate rock unite state low quality deposit much high cost open new mine high freight rate ship european asian market competition government subsidize phosphate rock operation foreign country 
the bureau mine analyst anticipate lost export sale phosphate rock make increased export sale manufacture phosphate fertilizer chemical united state continue export phosphate rock factor probably influence decision defer construction new phosphate mine 
the domestic supply position forecast exacerbate decline export market demand phosphate rock 
the bureau mine analyst feel none factor cite decline export appear reversible 
for long term phosphate industry proba 
bly find increasingly difficult compete international trade phosphate rock time progress north african middle east country increase manufacturing capacity phosphate fertilizer competitive position producer manufacture fertilizer probably erode international trade 
these bureau mine analyst subscribe scenario united state import phosphate rock cartel world market united state adequate domestic resource reason cite decline export also limit prohibit import phosphate rock unite state 
what actually happen future world phosphate rock price position relative position phosphate export country happen depend actual availability low cost phosphate rock reserve unite state throughout world
