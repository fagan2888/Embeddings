introduction compare many region central southern appalachian region quite restrict late cenozoic deposit 
most surficial deposit area never map small size limited economic potential 
the terrace deposit large river study quaternary geologist low terrace may correlate often yield datable organic material 
colluvium however although widespread deposit region receive almost attention 
geologist generally assume distribution characteristic colluvium deduce knowledge underlie bedrock material little significance except soil scientist 
this study small area vicinity mountain lake virginia attempt show detailed mapping colluvium upland surficial deposit make significant contribution understand landscape development 
the sedimentary characteristic colluvium boulder stream also examine paper 
colluvium investigate detail periglacial environment 
because correspond study colluvium nonperiglacial environment however exactly sedimentary property use identify periglacial slope deposit remain unknown despite importance question complete understanding quaternary geology 
another important characteristic colluvial deposit age 
although age measurement rare colluvium relative age determine study weather feature deposit readily obtain useful study hillslope evolution 
study two aspect colluvium examine variation degree weather sedimentary property among different topographic setting sedimentary evidence transport deposition catastrophic flood periglacial process 
bouldery scree common study area particularly hollow head sandstone outcrop 
scree herein mean unconsolidated rock fragment mountain slope 
talus landform compose scree particularly base ledge cliff

hack however provide evidence least scree produce present climatic condition suggest scree develops wher 
ever slop steep bedrock mechanically strong resistant chemical weather regardless climate 
boulder stream might relics transport periglacial frost action gelifluction probably also deposit catastrophic flood occur rare extremely intense rainfall 
the approach use interpret feature compare characteristic boulder stream mountain lake area report boulder deposit know origin elsewhere

the origin mountain lake engage attention many previous investigator

point sharp parker other great thickness insoluble martinsburg formation seem impossible solution limestone underlie formation could effect surface topography 
the scree dam hypothesis describe lucidly sharp theorize initially depression occupy mountain lake normal stream valley occupy stream flow northward tributary little stony creek 
long slope juniata martinsburg expose south outlet notch cut thscarora quartzite great block sandstone crept downward shale slope gradually fill valley bottom 
weathered particle organic material fill interstice thus make water tight dam impound lake

addition lake bottom near outlet compose immense block thscarora quartzite 
these block trace unbroken procession lake bottom parent ledge thscarora quartzite 100m northeast lake fig 
sharp also observe lack large block west outlet thus make appear outlet stream crowd west side notch thscarora block creep east 
although scree dam theory appear quite plausible two question remain 
first mechanism block transport 
although area note seismic activity example bollinger wheeler slope parent ledge seem much gentle rockfall move block 
more likely sharp suggestion 
creep may accelerate gelifluction periglacial process full glacial climatic condition pleistocene 
second important question mountain lake unique unglaciated valley ridge province breach anticlines thscarora quartzite outcrop common 
possibly several circumstance combine allow formation mountain lake gentle dip mountain lake anticline relatively high local base level stream drain mountain lake relatively high altitude lake area 
none condition uncommon valley ridge province combination three may well rare unique 
most lake form natural dam soon drain destruction dam 
thus although creep boulder scree stream valley probably common region incipient dam case rapidly eliminate 
mountain lake 
surficial geology and geomorphology giles county virginia

however circumstance make destruction dam exceedingly difficult 
because huge thscarora block cannot move flow water possible small drainage basin way drain lake would outlet stream cut laterally dam 
pond drain flow gentle dip slope resistant sandstone fig 
however greatly hinder incision 
downcutting make still difficult fact flood plain little stony creek whose elevation control sandstone unit hold cascade constitute local base level pond drain lie elevation mountain lake 
hence downcutting pond drain minor opportunity headwarderoding nickpoint provide gradient dam necessary cause local erosion vigorous enough drain lake 
another contribute factor may relatively high altitude mountain lake

this conclusion compatible theory hillslope evolution mention earlier describe detail elsewhere mill 
accord theory bouldery colluvium protect shale floor hollow mountain flank 
hollow junction boulder armor floor base unprotected shale side slope locus great erosion 
runoff rainstorm recurrence interval order perhaps year incise gully along margin bouldery deposit lack competence disturb deposit 
periodically however runoff catastrophic rainstorm recurrence interval order perhaps year great mobilizes bouldery colluvium deposit gully 
the armored floor thus shift laterally 
subsequently new gully incise adjacent old one 
the result lateral migration one wail hollow 
eventually ridge hollow destroy valley floor cover bouldery colluvium become new interfluves 
accord theory colluvium move downslope hollow 
creep slope wash course present nose although boulder armor greatly reduce rate operate 
addition nose characterize convex downhill contour debris erode process carry adjacent hollow rather straight nose 
hence interfluve colluvium essentially cease move reeroded laterally migrate hollow case colluvium nose therefore somewhat old hollow appear case present study area 
this explanation directly account difference degree weather thus presumably age upper low nose 
the great age lower nose colluvium however may consequence low rate lateral migration hollow gentle foot slope 
this low rate would allow interfluves attain great age would possible steeper 
upper slop olluvial cap would also older
