fault and joint spring 
ground water occupies open space within earth surface move along joint fault seams well bed stratify series 
the rock wall form two side fault usually sufficiently separate allow passage water fissure usually sufficient depth permit profound circulation 
ground water large area may contributar single fault zone may exert pressure sufficient drive water along crack considerable power 
most famous hot spring world locate fault line 
many small spring connecticut locate along fault temperature however indicate water come great depth 
the temperature ground depth foot affect daily seasonal change surface temperature water come depth therefore subject slight variation remain average annual temperature state 
hot spring report connecticut temperature rare 
spring record page five temperature less none 
the well know arethusa spring seymour temperature coincide average annual temperature state 
nonvolcanic region like connecticut temperature affords indication depth water come absence high temperature implies even fault spring occurrence water relatively surface phenomenon 
frequently report water spring colder normal summer warmer winter 
these statement however borne fact

underground water resource 
intermittent spring 
connecticut receive uniform evenly distribute rainfall forest cover spring state would practically permanent position constant yield 
the rainfall however uniformly distribute region partly woodland partly farm strata consist many variety rock soil 
the result spring constant vary yield cease entirely part year 
the flow spring much constant rainfall water 
rock absorb store much rapidly escape rainfall large area return surface channel 
the soil reservoir fill within hour allow drain several week 
connecticut supply water soil usually renew rain reservoir empty spring keep flow vary rate speed 
diagram illustrate condition intermittent spring 
for explanation see text 
the fact ground water return surface gradually chief factor insure permanency flow carry spring river period drought 
certain part country principal supply river furnish ground water part year water enters connecticut brook supply spring seeps 
spring normally give continuous flow may become intermittent dry season 
the hill show figure consist sand till allow water absorb large amount sink impervious stratum along ground water flow surface spring 
when water stand temporary spring may form cease flow water level drop unusually dry season water table may sink second outlet thus produce intermittent spring one constant several year

mineral spring 
all spring contain mineral matter large small amount presence may affect color odor taste water 
popular sense mineral spring notable large amount mineral content conspicuous characteristic water color odor taste presence unusual mineral ingredient consider therapeutic value 
dissolve rock material sometimes deposited mouths spring quantity amount several ton year 
even ordinary cold water spring carry surface appreciable amount rock 
estimate combined activity ordinary spring eastern part united state result pile year rock enough form block foot square mile long 
several spring connecticut report medicinal value 
many spring however pass medicinal merely forbid odor taste prove examination little favor 
hardly need state disagreeable characteristic evidence therapeutic value water 
there spring connecticut unusual abundance rare mineral constituent conspicuous color odor 
volume spring 
spring vary size minute trickle rill stream give rise small brook 
the amount water spring depend directly available supply drawn turn directly relate amount rainfall size area contributary spring 
the attitude structure rock also important consideration 
the rock may stratify may open bed plane wide extent may dense massive 
it texture may coarse fine 
may easily soluble resistant chemical 
furthermore distribution farm forest land relative position hill plain valley much collect water guide along channel lead spring 
us and production spring water
