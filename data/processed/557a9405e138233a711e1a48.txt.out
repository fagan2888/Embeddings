originally suggest potential site topographically hydrologically close basin acre approximately level perimeter ridgeline enclose volume million yd3 
this would provide landfill similar concept exist landfill western part county landfills involve 
method selection hydrologic description potential landfill site 
fill exist canyon 
early search process become evident topographically close basin meet criterion could find study area 
therefore criterion change area approximately acres relatively low slope contain unsaturated volume capable excavate million yd3 
requirement base calculate unsaturated volume minimum foot water table 
address volume criterion follow consider lithology fill depth water presence boulder bedrock outcrop bury pediment 
criterion involve access site visibility major road presence cultural feature building nearby well explicitly list county 
however brief note make phase site factor might significant 
addition geologic hydrologic sit criterion obtain california administrative code regulation concern discharge waste land california state legislature regulation include definition sit requirement construction standard class iii landfill 
these criterion include among other minimum distance waste ground water minimum distance flood plain fault area potential rapid geologic change 
this study orient toward class landfill define capability accepting designate waste addition nonhazardous solid waste 
nonhazardous waste define waste except contain waste must manage hazardous waste designate waste california state legislature 
designate waste nonhazardous waste contain soluble pollutant could release concentration excess applicable water quality objective could cause degradation water state california state legislature 
the administrative code regulation state class waste management unit shall contain 
hazardous waste 
the regulation also state natural artificial barrier liner shall use prevent movement fluid include waste leachate landfill ground water surface water 
many criterion decision involve sit construction operation solidwaste landfill concern protection surface water ground water impairment beneficial us 
for example state regulation specify waste shall minimum foot high anticipated altitude underlie ground water california state legislature addition knowledge occurrence movement surface water vicinity potential landfill sit important possibility pollution surface water resource possibility surface waste may cause degradation ground water quality possibility physical damage facility cause streamflow flooding 
regard administrative code california state legislature state class site shall design prevent inundation washout flood year recurrence interval 
seismic activity also adversely affect integrity landfill structure thereby allow leachate enter surface water ground water system 
the criterion set state location class site include foot setback know holocene fault california state legislature 
therefore holocene fault within near potential landfill sit must identify 
primary concern sit design landfill prevention downward movement leachate landfill ground water system 
regard regulation state class landfills shall immediately underlie natural material hydraulic conductivity ixlo 8xlo underlain artificial liner maximum conductivity california state legislature

field visit compilation exist data limited collection field data valuable method preliminary evaluation phase site 
the field visit primarily involve observation geomorphology occurrence bedrock outcrop surface water feature evidence shallow ground water 
exist data useful especially well record surface borehole geophysics climate record surface water record geologic map seismic study 
unfortunately exist data commonly sparse nonuniform distribution 
particular water level surface water data commonly available best area adjacent site 
some data drillers log difficult interpret 
the field data collect consist primarily water level measurement exist well vertical electrical sounding 
vertical electrical sounding advantage provide quick relatively effective method collect subsurface lithologic information approximate thickness alluvium residuum without drill test well 
do electrical resistivity sounding less time consume less expensive drilling test hole especially great depth numerous site involve reconnaissance phase 
however phase shallow drilling drive sample hollowstem auger rig nearly quick resistivity sounding 
study vertical electrical sounding particularly useful determine contact residuum alluvium partially weather unweathered bedrock 
interpretation sounding less successful determine depth water 
seismic refraction geophysics also useful reconnaissance method determine bedrock contact although method use study 
the disadvantage resistivity sounding comparison drill sample data collect indirect rather form actual lithologic 
evaluation method for selection description potential landfill site
