the rhyolite province differ markedly rhyolites andesitic province 
whereas andesitic associaations consist basalt andesite dacite rhyolite broad frequency distribution peak andesite rhyolite end member compositional spectrum basalt rhyolite province silicic rock limit remarkably limited place compositional range 
the andesite association rhyolites richly aluminous typically carry hornblende biotite basalt association rhyolites low aluminum generally lack aluminous accessory mineral carry instead clinopyroxene even fayalite 
these characteristic basaltassociated rhyolite suggest differentiate basaltic magma 
noted feature elsewhere hamilton 1960b 
the lack mafic cumulate lava rock interpretable crystal cumulates complementary rhyolite magma basalt rhyolite province argue possibility fractionation crystallization process broderick emphasize lake superior region 
the coexistence rhyolite basalt magma single magma chamber difficult explain term liquid fractionation

these long thought rest upon platform continental rock represent either foundered north atlantic continent plate continental structure sunder continental drift

aluminum remain nearly constant 
intermediate eruption systematically intermediate composition 
high lava magma column erupt first chronologic sequence also sequence position initial magma chamber change indicate magma vertically grade composition

the mechanism accordingly suggest dominant mean differentiation within hawaiian tholeiites

contribution the geology antarctica 
erupt small volume widely space locality interbedded upper tholeiites tilley power macdonald katsura 
these alkaline rock represent decline stage volcanism best explain term stagnation resultant strong differentiation contamination tholeiitic magma 
yoder tilley other hypothesize trifle volume alkaline rock produce different parent magma generate different part mantle tholeiites 
this speculation seem contradicted time volume relationship rock strong differentiation universally show difficulty explain simultaneously compositional peculiarity combination high alkalis low silica high magnesium alkaline rock 
the yoder tilley speculation base upon assumption differentiation mechanism operative basaltic magma crystal fractionation since petrologists note demonstrated quantitatively hawaiian alkaline rock cannot produce separation crystal tholeiite magma yoder tilley conclude magma must produce alkaline rock 
the yoder tilley mechanism would account serve difference alkali content two basaltic magma type silica change would posit require hence mechanism cannot operate postulate 
the hawaiian alkaline rock contain abundant phenocrysts complex history crystal settle show within many lava flow 
crystal cumulate nodule lack primitive lava numerous many alkaline flow even associate pyroclastics power 
these magma clearly fractionate part crystal settling 
kelative semitholeiitic primitive basalt decliningphase basalt enrich alkalis particularly potassium titanium magnesium highly oxidize iron impoverish silica 
the change abundance alkalis titanium iron suggest liquid fractionation somehow operate produce much differentiation alkaline basalt semitholeiitic basalt 
macdonald katsura draw similar inference 
the major hawaiian differentiate alkaline basalt extremely different rhyolite iceland may due different composition primitive basalt 
the hawaiian primitive lava richer silica modern icelandic basalt also conspicuously rich magnesium poorer 
aluminum calcium 
the different ionic association original melt cause difference could perhaps result migration different group element 
other factor oxidation ratio iron might contribute differentiation trend
