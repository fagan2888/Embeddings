foreword the regional aquifer system analysis program the regional aquifer system analysis rasa program start congressional mandate develop quantitative appraisal major ground water system united state 
the rasa program represent systematic effort study number nation important aquifer system aggregate underlie much country represent important component nation total water supply 
general boundary study identify hydrologic extent system accordingly transcend political subdivision investigation often arbitrarily limit past 
the broad objective study assemble geologic hydrologic geochemical information analyze develop understanding system develop predictive capability contribute effective management system 
the use computer simulation important element rasa study develop understanding natural undisturbed hydrologic system change bring human activity provide mean predict regional effect future pumping stress 
the final interpretive result rasa program present series geological survey professional paper describe geology hydrology geochemistry regional aquifer system 
each study within rasa program assign single professional paper number volume interpretive material warrant separate topical chapter consider principal element investigation may publish 
the series rasa interpretive report begin professional paper thereafter continue numerical sequence interpretive product subsequent study become available

because canadian province saskatchewan manitoba stratigraphic unconformities paleozoic aquifer overlie confine unit result favorable condition accumulation oil gas stratigraphic trap mccabe ground water discharge concentrate along eastern rather northern limit madison aquifer 
corollary condition area generally must unfavorable discharge ground water madison aquifer vertical leakage 
area minimal ground water flow eastern flank williston basin coincides area water high concentration dissolve solid brine large fluid density fig 
three hypothesis consider interpret flow near area water high density 
the first hypothesis brine area static hydrologic situation similar describe hubbert freshwater flow synclinal structure come contact static dense brine along sharp interface 
hubbert show body saline water condition lie uniformly deep part structure rather displace upward along base outflow flank inflow flank occupy entirely move freshwater outflow flank contain static brine lower part aquifer move freshwater brine area 
the flow freshwater williston basin around dense 
brine area well flow pattern reflect structure actually basin rather simple syncline analyze hubbert 
the flow brine area apparently leak upward unit overlie madison rather contain upper part madison 
simulation result however show small consistent flow velocity generally direct east northeast high density brine cambrianordovician madison aquifer 
the simulation indicate small component regional flow actually move directly across williston basin west east high density brine area 
the low flow velocity brine area demonstrate brine static hubbert theorize synclinal model 
the second hypothesis assume slow movement flow exist brine 
this hypothesis allow explanation origin brine brine may attribute solution salt halite bed water move basin describe grossman 
the process solution enhance increase water temperature depth high salinity find region high temperature 
reduction salinity updip area eastern flank basin presumably due least part precipitation halite associate cooler temperature although dilution fresher water also undoubtedly factor 
extent precipitation halite occur result gradual reduction permeability geologic time interval area precipitation occurs 
velocity flow slow relative elsewhere system flow fresher water appear deflect around brine north south leakage upward confine bed aquifer overlie madison aquifer 
thus hydraulics density distribution resemble would observe system totally static brine 
the third hypothesis assume brine motion seek adjust change recharge discharge associate end pleistocene glaciation 
these change discuss 
brine static condition pleistocene glaciation condition could equilibrium new condition impose retreat ice sheet 
the brine would begin move end glaciation would seek new equilibrium new recharge discharge readjustment could still progress 
such process could contribute extent apparent movement brine however velocity compute simulation appear indicate flow across basin rather adjustment glacial change

addition distribution saline water may still shift response change recharge discharge end pleistocene glaciation 
saline water also find part project area example deeper part powder river basin although concentration encounter

similar process presumably apply explain distribution movement saline water 
because highland recharge area cover major ice sheet glacial stage pleistocene recharge continue available bedrock aquifer glaciation 
this condition would enable solution halite along western edge williston basin glacial period

such variation would number implication term regional flow pattern 
the existence water base continental ice sheet suggest many investigator robin gow veda garfield mcginnis 
the water result melt base ice geothermal frictional heat 
mcginnis estimate heat available temperate ice sheet source could produce ft3 meltwater per square foot surface area ice sheet per year 
this water might least area high pressure weight overlie ice case widespread areal recharge ground water system occur area cover continental ice sheet 
the configuration ice northern great plain vary continuously pleistocene flint result distribution recharge would vary continuously 
high region west form present recharge area also presumably would recharge area prior glaciation glacial interglacial period pleistocene 
however period strong glacial advance recharge would occur northern eastern part study area well 
the regional flow ground water condition must south toward available discharge area nebraska 
continental ice successively retreat advanced direction regional ground water flow would 
varied accordingly generate complex history movement 
however solution halite deep part williston basin must occur throughout history flow system velocity flow area brine accumulation must remain small regardless direction flow 
result several hypothetical simulation condition indicate repeat change flow direction probably would result major displacement saline water rather relatively minor shift position 
thus term deep brine glacial change probably represent transient disturbance major redistribution 
summary flow pattern prior glaciation pre sumably similar present sustain recharge high area west 
glaciation produce repeatedly vary pattern flow general alter pattern seem prevail long period cause major change distribution brine
