methane carbon dioxide water main byproduct coalification process 
the major stage thermal methane generation devolatilization coal estimate begin attainment high volatile bituminous rank 
addition significant amount biogenic gas produce decomposition organic matter relatively low rank coal anaerobic bacteria 
most gas coal bed probably store internal surface organic matter molecular attraction adsorb within molecular structure coal absorb 
the volume methane store coal function rank pressure temperature 
general coal increase rank higher sorptive capacity 
reservoir property coal bed complex differ considerably conventional reservoir 
coal essentially impermeable except cleat fracture provide primary network gas flow coal wellbore 
the cleat coal bed think result dehydration devolatilization tectonic stress 
the openness cleat hence permeability coal decrease increase pressure depth burial 
primary target coalbed methane exploration within surface mccord jones debruin 
below depth possibly even shallow depth permeability coal bed decrease sensitivity coal pressure 
gas store coal generally hold hydrostatic pressure water saturate coal bed 
the source water may either inherent moisture may grind water inasmuch coal bed generally good aquifer well develop cleat 
gas production initiate dewatering coal result reduction hydrostatic pressure
