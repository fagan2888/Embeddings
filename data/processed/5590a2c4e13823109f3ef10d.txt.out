the purpose volume familiarize reader work complete blue mountain region emphasize region importance understand island arc process accretion allochthonous terrane continent 
these professional paper provide current interpretation complex island arc terrane accrete ancient north america late mesozoic era large batholith emplace accretion occur overlie cenozoic volcanic rock subsequently uplift partly strip old rock erosion 
modern island arcs well understood even less ancient arc deform metamorphose subsequently accrete continent 
learn characteristic modern arcs change significantly along across arc ax study arc fragment less satisfactory generally characterize entire arc 
for example landward trench slop arcs differ greatly depend whether material descend slab accrete slope tectonically erode process dominates apparently related volume sediment adjacent trench vector plate convergence 
addition arc aleutian broad long sediment fill fore arc basin whereas other tongakermadec fore arc insular slope descend precipitously trench depth interrupt 
place narrow fault bound terrace 
moreover arcs tonga kermadec erupt primarily tholeiitic igneous product throughout history other aleutian long history calcalkaline tholeiitic eruptive activity 
ridge ax island arc may narrow broad arc solomon vanuatu axial region extend form deep bathymetric sedimentary basin 
even back arc basin different origin history development 
some mariana trough lau basin active spreading ridge whereas other aleutian basin floor ancient oceanic crust trap behind arc 
because knowledge diverse process within modern arc limit becomes even important study ancient analog 
just nature land exposure ancient arcs provide insight sedimentary facies magmatic evolution deep crustal process study modern arcs geophysical method dredge drilling 
few ancient island arc exposure well develop extensive blue mountain region 
particularly spectacular helpful outcrop provide intensive stream erosion leave canyon wall deep snake river canyon west seven devil mountain

the 4oar 39ar method first use total fusion experiment irradiated sample completely melt isotope argon measure single analysis calculate date sample

very soon first use 40ar 39ar method realize sample could progressively degassed temperature increment merrihue turner

the character spectrum evaluate within theoretical framework interpret apparent distribution potassium argon within sample 
turner show date temperature increment meteorites identical within analytical precision plot age spectrum diagram show date temperature increment function percent 39ar release experiment spectrum form plateau 
contrast age spectra exhibit distinct increase date temperature increment low temperature high temperature extraction step experiment 
turner show theoretically age spectrum exhibit step date argon lose sample geologic environment thermally activate volume diffusion 
the age spectrum exhibit plateau sample never disturb formation sample completely reset young event 
depend amount thermal disturbance percentage argon lose date younger low temperature fraction equal old age thermal disturbance affect sample whereas date old high temperature fraction equal young original age closure 
this step date exhibit age spectrum 
apparently result argon loss due geologic activity experimentally reproduce harrison hornblende observe numerous investigator data hornblende muscovite feldspar see example snee other harrison 
recently reliability hornblende mineral include muscovite feldspar recorder geologically induce thermally activate argon loss age spectrum produce experimental degas laboratory challenge lee other 
their contention hydrous mineral particular also feldspar undergo change include dehydration melt phase conversion heat vacuum prevent release argon thermally activated volume diffusion mineral 
thus accord lee other experimental reproduction geologic phenomenon argon loss impossible 
although mechanism responsible development apparent argon loss age spectra hornblende feldspar muscovite may completely understand question pattern exhibit many mineral undergo partial argon loss due reheat late thermal activity 
besides thermally activate volume diffusion several possible mechanism explain apparent argon loss spectrum 
for example two phase different closure age may coexist one rock 
phase different age similar enough physical character coexist mineral separate example one phengite white mica form highpressure metamorphic condition muscovite white mica form high temperature condition phase degas vacuum different temperature range resultant age spectrum represent mixture age spectra sample resemble argon loss spectrum roeske other 
similarly single phase mineral separate several grain sizes structural type degas different temperature vacuum produce result cosca other 
example apparent argon loss spectrum interpret result thermally activated volume diffusion 
that apparent age young low temperature fraction approximately age old thermal disturbance apparent age old high temperature fraction approximately age young original closure 
therefore apparent argon loss spectrum potentially 
petrology and tectonic evolution pre tertiary rock blue mountain region 
useful understand thermal history complex geologic environment 
however caution must take interpret apparent argon loss spectra nongeologic factor extraction system blank sample impurity affect age spectrum 
besides argon loss excess 40ar detect sample

the mechanism incorporation excess 40ar rock mineral unknown several possible explanation exist 
rock mineral crystallize environment contains argon 40ar 36ar ratio great present day ratio atmospheric argon extra 40ar excess 
similarly hydrothermal fluid know carry argon commonly 40ar 36ar ratio composition great perhaps due interaction rock contain radiogenic argon 
fluid alter become incorporated rock mineral excess 40ar add rock mineral 
several study example lanphere dalrymple kaneoka document large quantity excess 40ar sample produce saddle shape 40ar 39ar age spectrum anomalously old date lowtemperature high temperature extraction step 
small quantity excess 40ar commonly affect low temperature step form shape spectrum 
many study show meaningful age sample could determine age spectrum technique even though loss gain 40ar occur geologic history sample 
however loss gain 40ar sample result erroneous conventional date loss gain 40ar sample primarily thermally control sample thermally complex area metamorphic plutonic complex analyze 40ar 39ar age spectrum technique 
similarly conventional data geologic setting view caution 
ideally sample date 40ar 39ar age spectrum technique yield concordant date temperature step

metamorphic and structural development island arc rock west central idaho 
discussion the general structural geometry slate creek john day creek area stack thrust plate 
successively high easterly plate stratigraphy less well understood eastward increase complexity metamorphic overprinting structure give rise several major interrelate problem 
first unclear many stratigraphically distinct allochthons terranes occur area may many three terranes single terrane may imbricate 
secondly mechanism eastward increase complexity metamorphism deformation problematic cause suggest include plate interaction dynamic emplacement idaho batholith 
question correlation stratigraphically coherent sequence arise absence date unit medium high grade metamorphism rock transposition bedding 
physical continuity date rock along snake river rock along salmon river make possible correlate rock wallowa terrane oregon exposure western part slate creek john day creek area 
however sedimentology stratigraphy martin bridge formation western idaho well documented metamorphism deformation 
the progressive increase metamorphic grade also problem correlation rock ofthe rapid river plate 
greenschist facies rock find near riggins rock first describe hamilton 1963a whereas slate creek john day creek area rock think along strike upper amphibolite facies onasch lund mccollough 
therefore difficult correlate unit plate across structural break 
most importantly little lithologic chemical difference unit wallowa terrane rapid river plate hamilton 1963a virtually impossible distinguish like metamorphic grade unit cannot trace along strike 
this problem even significant rock north fork block even gross lithologic boundary unit transpose intruded 
furthermore know difference composition previous history conclusively separate rock either wallowa terrane rapid river plate 
probably detailed chemical study date extrusive age volcanic protolith difference among allochthonous sequence conclusively determine 
rock sequence compositionally similar know difference among superimposed cretaceous orogenic event seem plausible consider rock imbricate part single island arc terrane 
basis successively overprint fabric ofage data deformation ofthe rock slate creekjohn day creek area apparently occur several discrete step 
least two stage metamorphism document early low grade metamorphism associate dynamic process produce foliation late high grade metamorphism associate process form pervasive crosscut foliation rock north fork block include late cretaceous tonalite idaho batholith 
age data indicate several additional grouping among medium high grade rock 
these grouping data may relate multiple discrete thermal pulse intermittent nonthermal tectonism periodically expose hotter rock deeper crustal level cool 
the early plutonic rock idaho batholith intrude island arc continental rock involve deformation affect north fork block 
zone ofintense deformation clearly crosscut early dynamothermal fabric structure 
analyze structural zone east riggins south ofthe slate creek john day creek area hamilton 1963b interpret complex mixture deform metamorphic plutonic rock zone vertical plutonic flow call part western border zone idaho batholith 
conclude deformation metamorphism western idaho result westward thrust idaho batholith low grade metavolcanic rock wallowa terrane area north fork block zone ofmovement batholithic rock island arc rock metamorphism deformation west ofthe zone cause event thought occur middle cretaceous 
however evidence strain great toward salmon river suture find increasingly complex dynamothermal overprint island arc rock along oceanic continental boundary north harpster near riggins one approach suture fig 
hamilton 1963a myers onasch 
addition metamorphic intensity amount strain record continental rock also great toward boundary irrespective relative amount plutonic rock present 
except zone within suture plutonic rock cut earlier dynamothermal fabric 
therefore metamorphism deformation slate creek 
petrology and tectonic evolution pre tertiary rock blue mountain region 
john day creek area predate plutonic rock idaho batholith dynamothermal process localize along salmon river suture independent intrusive boundary earliest pluton deform last stage late early late cretaceous regional dynamothermal event 
this orogenic event form salmon river suture cause associated metamorphism deformation probably also responsible formation idaho batholith 
age data show metamorphic deformational feature describe herein mapping nearby area hamilton 1963a onasch mccollough cretaceous 
the dynamothermal event last include several major stage 
amphibolite facies rock record possible earlier precretaceous dynamothermal event destroy temperature high strain associate late early late cretaceous deformation 
addition area affect earlier event localize along east edge island arc rock apparently wider present orogenic belt record dynamothermal event low greenschist facies rock indicates deformation also date cretaceous 
conclusion even low grade metamorphic rock wallowa terrane west central idaho stratigraphy adequately establish 
metamorphic complication structural complexity lack isotopic age data contribute problem 
spite generally inadequate stratigraphic data detail study slate creek john day creek area provide new information insight stratigraphy wallowa terrane western idaho 
although formation delineate rock study area permian metavolcanic rock either hunsaker creek windy ridge formation triassic doyle creek formation seven devil group area lund other

despite fact rock south side john day creek along strike physical continuity unit rapid river plate riggins group define hamilton 1963a lateral trace unit across structure metamorphic facies boundary proven impossible many place 
where rock wallowa terrane consist medium grade metamorphic rock rock type identical originally describe medium grade rock rapid river plate 
likewise amphibolite facies rock north fork block lithologically similar amphibolite facies rapid river plate 
rock rapid river plate originally separate metavolcanic rock wallowa terrane high metamorphic grade distinct map unit recognize rock time low grade volcanic rock despite chemical similarity hamilton 1963a 
know distinct unit exist seven devil group wallowa terrane vallier like grade metamorphism similarity difference among rock three main structural unit describe study 
the combination similar stratigraphy three plate characteristically complex original stratigraphy change metamorphic grade complexly overprint macroscopic structure make difficult separate rock different plate regional basis 
additionally stack plate similar history throughout metamorphic deformational event affect structure juxtaposed plate late early late cretaceous propose rock rapid river plate previously call riggins group north fork block might best consider lead edge wallowa terrane 
these rock may highgrade multiply deformed portion wallowa terrane strongly affect dynamothermal process increase involvement

the fold axes slate creek antiform associate mesoscopic fold perpendicular determined direction movement along rapid river thrust fault 
fold late reverse fault form slate creek antiform may signify low plate response deformation north fork block coaxial slate creek antiform indicate movement along thrust fault westward generally parallel movement direction determine rapid river thrust fault 
thus regional stress seem maintain consistent orientation several discrete event relate follow formation rapid river thrust fault 
prograde metamorphic fabric island arc metamorphic rock slate creek john day creek area develop multiply deform prior intrusion early pluton idaho batholith 
these pluton intrude island arc continental rock thereby seal join north american continent accrete island arc rock 
although metamorphic grade increase eastward toward main mass plutonic rock pluton contact regionally crosscut metamorphic pattern 
more importantly continental metamorphic rock form roof pendant main mass idaho batholith metamorphic grade also increase westward suture zone metamorphic pattern structure continental metamorphic rock also cut plutonic rock lund
