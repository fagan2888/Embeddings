schuster crandell siebert other suggest method whereby runout debris avalanche estimate 
scheidegger study landslides volume great million show height length ratio approximate coefficient friction inversely proportional volume 
voight other show mobility volcanic debris avalanche exceed landslide 
height determine measure relief top potential slide mass point valley schuster crandell 
runout calculate hand fare know 
schuster crandell determine representative coefficient friction select volcanic debris avalanche suggest use average conservative coefficient friction 
siebert other suggest coefficient friction range average debris avalanche volumes great km3 coefficient range average 
debris avalanche volume km3 
the relief summit mount adam trout lake near community mount adams along white salmon river 140m 
use equal debris avalanche volumes significantly less km3 coefficient friction flow far would affect trout lake 
debris avalanche volume km3 coefficient friction might flow could destroy community trout lake 
future debris avalanche like postglacial time significantly small km3 probably reach trout lake 
small lahar like occur mount adam postglacial time would flow great distance great mobility would debris avalanche similar volume 
thus small lahar could easily inundate trout lake lowland 
the trout lake mudflow salt creek lahar volume considerably less km3 low coefficient friction 
whereas debris avalanche result exclusively slope failure lahars form several way 
the large lahar mount adams result slope failures mass rock probably contain much water move mass transform lahar 
these cohesive lahar move much valley past year 
the osceola mudflow mount rainy year old lahar similar origin flow source crandell 
addition lahar form dewatering debris avalanche deposit flow mount helen janda other 
mount adam small noncohesive lahar also form glacial outburst flood small volume limit extent 
future lahars type unlikely affect community white salmon river drainage near distant might endanger people near volcano 
none postglacial lahar study mount adam know cause magmatic eruption nevertheless interaction hot rock snow ice eruption particularly occur near summit could cause lahar flood might flow ten kilometer valley

lava flow mount adam might destroy road trail campground could easily start forest fire 
once lava flow begin easy predict approximate path 
like lava flow past future lava flow mount adam probably extend obstacle path 
lava flow originate near summit mount adam might flow rapidly steep flank cone extend great distance vent originate gentler slope 
however summit vent flow unlikely extend beyond apron volcano distant moreover flow would move slowly gentler slope 
hazard from explosive eruption because mount adam erupt neither pyroclastic flow widespread tephras postglacial time unlikely erupt similar product foreseeable future similarity mount rainier explosive eruption occur could model holocene eruption document crandell mullineaux 
eruption could occur vent almost anywhere mount adam 
pyroclastic flow would concentrate valley would unlikely move area within gifford pinchot national forest yakima indian reservation 
ifpyroclastic flow occur snowline winter snow ice might melt hot rock produce lahar flood might flow many ten kilometer valley 
explosive eruption also might deposit tephra downwind active vent 
because prevail westerly wind tephra would probably direct eastward could direct quarter crandell mullineaux crandell 
tephra eruption like holocene eruption mount rainier probably would extend mullineaux 
mild strombolian eruption produce scoria spatter cone like one form red butte north flank mount adam plate 
such eruption throw hot pasty lava fragment several hundred meter vent may produce minor tephra bed downwind
