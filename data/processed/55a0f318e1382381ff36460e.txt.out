welcome remark workshop earthquake hazard along the wasatch front utah norman bangerter governor state utah salt lake city utah welcome utah delight 
people come utah sort reason spectacular scenery cultural event ski etc glad people find geologic hazard something come utah see rather run away 
know genevieve think state license plate could utah geologic hazard state tourist bureau share enthusiasm 
earthquake the cornerstone administration call economic development efficiency government education 
earthquake start also 
how state want encourage development cut cost government increase committment school reconcile goal earthquake would appear discourage development increase cost government 
quite easily 
tell like 
developer quite sophisticate 
they know earthquake hazard utah 
the type information acquire reduces scare factor reduce uncertainty allows take appropriate action 
efficiency government commit right thing cheaply 
save state money build unsafe building eventually public pay usually much would cost do right first time 
great salt lake governor learn quite bit geologic hazard particularly great salt lake 
first hazard big 
know lake would keep rising start earlier pump plan save million dollar hundred job 
want say earthquake happen state 
develop public policy earthquake preparedness difficult 
but develop public policy must understand problem work important 
earthquake like lake rise period year remind day hazard backyard 
know cost lake rampage small compare happen major earthquake wasatch front 
note genevieve atwood director state geologist utah geological mineral survey salt lake city utah 
the lake also teach lesson normal behavior 
the lake act normally rise fall response precipitation evaporation 
it current rise unusual geologic perspective although disconcert 
earthquake normal 
somehow learned live compatibly hazard rather deny existence 
development preparedness always believe personal preparedness 
legislator governor believe plan local government level 
believe development believe buyer beware take considerable responsibility 
but also believe disclosure 
concern buyer homeowner business owner able obtain information hazard property 
act ion support applaud effort 
like team effort see agenda team effort 
appreciate geological survey invest much state 
delighted see university utah utah state university various local geologist utah division comprehensive emergency management federal emergency management agency utah geological mineral survey program 
and want see stop 
the state utah need continue part team specifically see scientific concept get user public 
that goverment taxpayer 
want utah geological mineral survey make sure science stay scientist 
genevieve want good people know much care taxpayer get pay 
and want know much admire dedication work help understand earthquake hazard utah 
sure hope successful sure hope earthquake prepared happen governor

mid september send final version close report washington state seismic safety council 
final draft wait state agency comment 
ask dick buck schedule time part october plan meeting linda noson give overview report implication next step regard policy development state 
first impression utah session 
impressed number thing come together good press coverage reasonably strong advocacy earthquake risk reduction within state particularly role ugms quality information base potential risk technology display bob alexander work sense momemtum despite recent legacy inaction state level could capitalize upon 
time bit surprised policy implementation issue think state local level procedure revise code zone designation status liability within state alternative financing mechanism cost retrofit 
presumably come type commitment seek agency end session 
most importantly appear three year make considerable headway shift primarily federally dominated effort term expertise leadership state driven effort 
m233 smith telephone 
with respect similar effort washington state must admit considerable concern potential fostering type state level advocacy necessary long run success translate usgs research activity effective state local action 
the legacy state detail fully report one series hoc effort largely driven interested individual outside state government without strong advocacy within state government agency 
moreover federal funding make available help induce state activity fema funding call puget sound earthquake preparedness effort state largely drop ball 
this may strike different situation go utah interim result seem emergence strong state partner ugms 
sense base upon conversation various side effort launch seismic safety effort state recent council situation different 
the division emergency management likely evolve lead advocate indicate limited capacity deliver fema fund support council effort 
the geologist office may compatible lead partner function state government restrict necessary front end policy work advocacy 
indeed would argue limitation ugms ran utah able overcome part director political sensitivity skill 
our seismic safety council due expire end federal fiscal year

rather argue best create desire base create state base information policy center seismic safety 
the key center strong individual appropriate tie state agency 
confident best individual linda noson carry title state seismologist reality partially fund university washington without state funding title carry 
the appropriate organizational structure would something like usgs fund university washington seimsinological information education policy center provision state agency participation 
such arrangement would provide person demonstrated track record state organization credibility among state agency sufficient freedom begin influence state local policy 
the center conjunction division earth resource geology department natural resource ray lasmanis would essentially responsible state end partnership 
this could include go educational informational activity response press individual inquiry structure education program coordination data source information newsletter among particpants puget sound effort organize seminar annual workshop 
the implementation aspects usgs program could promote envisioned center begin early establishing policy forum various people bring address liability financing issue 
this could link state policy development create advisory board center effect play role current washington seismic safety council 
the difference current situation newly create center would position provide strong staff dissemination function presently case 
such center need require large staff since primarily coordinate activity 
would take director linda noson perhaps two three staff people plus appropriate support staff operation funding 
the policy forum work well would require fund individual expert write commissioned paper key policy issue 
let close indicating letter write effort offer constructive idea foster state local action washington state 
the idea stimulate recent experience seismic safety council also reflect research undertaken study federal level primarily fema effort stimulate hazard reduction program
