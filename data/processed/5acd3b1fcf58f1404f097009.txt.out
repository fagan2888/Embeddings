evolution how barnacle come parasitise shark 
new study parasitic barnacle live deep sea shark find close live relative rocky shore barnacle 
the ﬁndings provide insight barnacle phylogeny raise new question evolution parasitism 
tommy leung parasitism one common modes life planet 
independently evolve several time 
domain life many animal phylum parasitic specie 
but parasite group little know make evolutionary transition 
dispatch r565 
free living parasitic mode life 
this mainly due two reason 
first many parasite derive morphology bear little resemblance free living relative 
for example enteroxenos oestergreni parasitic snail life inside holothurian sea cucumber yet adult snail nothing long string gonad 
secondly parasites general poor fossil record tend small soft body organism rarely preserve fossil 
thus lack transitional form available inform evolution free living parasitic lifestyle might occur aside compare parasite closest live relative 
issue current biology rees 
report study anelasma squalicola peculiar stalk barnacle parasitises deep sea squaloid shark velvet belly lantern shark etmopterus spinax 
they examine phylogenetic position anelasma within stalked barnacle clade analysis place group rocky shore stalked barnacle closest live relative anelasma 
parasitism evolve multiple time within crustacea parasitic crustacean resemble free living relative morphology many specie become derive completely unrecognisable arthropod 
among cirripedia barnacle well know parasitic specie sacculina carcini crab infect parasite castrate decapod host also capable alter morphology behaviour host care parasite brood 
sacculina carcini belongs superorder endoparasite call rhizocephala 
these barnacle lose almost trace arthropod ancestry adult body plan consist branch mass ﬁne rootlets extend throughout interior host body bulbous female reproductive organ protrude host abdomen 
aside rhizocephalans two genus parasitic barnacle rhizolepas infects polychaete worm anelasma subject rees study 
unlike stalk 
parasitic non parasitic barnacle 
specimen anelasma squalicola full 
capitulum mitellam intertidal stalk barnacle find close live relative squalicola 
barnacle obtain food ﬁltering water column limbs anelasma draws nutrition directly shark host peduncle bulbous structure cover ﬁne root like ﬁlaments deeply embed shark body figure 
but unlike sacculina rhizocephalans anelasma still morphological characteristic non parasitic ancestry form vestigal feed limb wholly non functional 
apart specie barnacles strictly ﬁlter feeder though many live epibionts attach surface animal 
one group coronuloidea superfamily cirriped specialise attach various mobile marine animal include cetacean sirenian sea turtle sea snake crustacean 
while coronuloids form relatively superﬁcial attachment other deeply embed host tissue structure physiological adaptation anchor securely host body 
unlike anelasma coronuloids remain nutritionally independent host strictly ﬁlter feeder 
but give already somewhat invasive least degree interaction host physiology seem prime position evolve true parasite 
anelasma evolve share common ancestry group barnacle 
this scenario certainly appeal anelasma coronuloids embed body marine animals one therefore envision anelasma heavily derive coronluoid gradually abandon ﬁlter feed favour draw nourishment host attach 
but analysis rees colleague challenge scenario 
they find close live relative anelasma actually intertidal barnacle attach non living substrate figure mean anelasma coronuloids independently evolve respective association marine animal 
current biology vol r566 
give stark contrast lifestyle habitat anelasma close living relative suggest gap currently unknown extinct specie might transitional form anelasma stalked barnacle 
furthermore rees analysis point origin anelasma lineage date back million year ago cretaceous period 
they suggest anelasma may actually remnant specie clade far speciose past 
though anelasma found specie deep water shark might part diverse group parasitic stalk barnacle infect wider range marine animal 
but coronuloids barnacle live epibionts 
give lineage lead anelasma successfully evolve parasitic ancestor likely rock cling ﬁlter feeder none coronuloids evolve parasitic since 
specie already deeply embed body various animal 
the result rees study provide additional perspective take organism evolve free live parasite lifestyle 
also raise question certain group coronuloid barnacle evolve parasitic even though seem prime position 
the discovery anelasma close live relative intertidal rather epibiont barnacle also remind likely plausible evolutionary scenario come may necessarily correspond actually happen 
the evolutionary history organism convolute complex always conform expectation
