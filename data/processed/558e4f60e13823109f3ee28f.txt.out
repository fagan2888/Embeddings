introduction the geological survey require congress public law provide locatable mineral report forest service whenever national forest system land sell exchange 
this volume compilation report already provide forest service author fiscal year 
altogether report describe geology resource potential property cover considerably acres national forest national grassland 
locatable mineral report must generate promptly provide complete reliable information even though sizes land parcel degree difficulty produce report varies 
each report must research write use library resource professional experience interview geoscientists appropriate field work conduct 
the report formally review appropriate scientist ask give informal feedback submit forest service 
copy report reside geological survey mineral resource program forest service file 
many land exchange mutual convenience gather federal private land manageable block 
some proposal towns county state enhance common good 
other motivate rancher improve graze lands efficiency operation 
many recent land exchange offer direct toward acquisition public land high value recreation area ski area 
the potential litigation controversy politics much high land exchange involve high value real estate exchange involve common grazing land 
hence locatable mineral report must reliable enough withstand scrutiny litigant vie high stake real estate 
thirteen report include volume 
they group state alphabetically forest 
each report start cover letter follow page summarize location property either verbatim paraphrase description supply forest service designate exhibit 
geologic description property mineral potential reference comprise main body report
