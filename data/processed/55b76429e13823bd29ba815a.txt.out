petroleum consider 
preliminary review individual mineral commodity resume give general geography geology colombia country mining law 
the principal mineral commodity besides petroleum produce colombia emerald gold platinum silver mainly export barite cement clay coal gypsum salt sand gravel silica stone mainly domestic market 
large number mineral commodity know raw prospect may eventually become productive 
their distribution apparent potentiality give 
factor unfavorable mining ruggedness terrain scarcity outcrop high transportation cost 
present mining interest apart petroleum restrict westnorthwestern half country include three main range andes two outlying range intermontane valley extensive coastal lowland area 
the eastern range andes name cordillera oriental compose mainly intensely fold fault strata cretaceous early tertiary age jurassic triassic even paleozoic stratum fairly widespread 
several massif crystalline complex partly wholly pre cambrian age long belt slightly metamorphose early paleozoic rock also crop cordillera oriental 
the cordillera central essentially massif metamorphic plutonic igneous rock cannot closely date yet regard pre cretaceous however sedimentary stratum mesozoic age much locally interbedded igneous material reach even across southern part range 
the western range andes name cordillera occidental little known assemblage layer sedimentary rock place sequence interbedded abundance igneous rock cross cut igneous batholith stock hypabyssal body tentatively assign mesozoic age 
the outlying santa marta range essentially massif contain central batholith surround metamorphic rock pre jurassic age serranla baud6 think construct rock analogous cordillera occidental 
the principal coastal lowland area marine tertiary stratum whereas intermontane valley area nonmarine tertiary stratum 
geologic investigation the american republic both marine nonmarine stratum young miocene age strongly fold faulted andean revolution 
undeformed andesite flow tuff volcanic breccia mountain sedimentary material valley lowland postdate andean revolution 
antimony prospect know caldas tolima cauca 
during three prospect yield intermittently aggregate output metric ton stibnite prospect doubtless could exploit small scale give adequate demand price 
chrysotile asbestos occur antioquia narifio perhaps departamentos 
although deposit remain almost unprospected offer little hope lead large ore body 
barite deposit exploit huila norte santander santander tolima promise deposit discover magdalena 
general vein individually contain thousand metric ton barite 
the demand barite chiefly oil well drilling expect increase domestic output mine favorably locate respect transportation market likewise increase 
the consumption barite metric ton perhaps half come domestic mine 
bauxite discover deposit could utilize raw material aluminum 
cement produce six plant own five company locate four departamentos 
the daily output average metric ton value approximately american currency 
the demand probably would metric ton per day quantity cement available 
accordingly five plant intend expand capacity soon equipment become available two new plant envisage 
chromite find scattered locality antioquia

clay product particularly roof tile brick make countless locality scatter throughout country production statistic available

the total output amount metric ton value 
reserve reliably estimate may tentatively place billion metric ton 
the coal range sub bituminous bituminous locally yield lowgrade coke 
copper deposit widespread probably single know outcrop offer reasonable hope explore lead large commercially valuable body ore hand intensive systematic scout areal map prospect select area abundant though lean miner conceivably could yield favorable clue 
moreover several locality merit soil strip determine surface dimension tenor small mixed sulflde lode 
copper say produce colonial later time apparently come small shoot may work primarily gold content

very small deposit iron ore occur cundinamarca ironrich laterites antioquia 
lead prospect report six departamentos two prospect santander one caldas merit consideration possible source ore domestic market none seem promise possible source ore export 
perhaps metric ton galena concentrate per day could recover large gold mine antioquia give adequate financial inducement 
the consumption lead colombia may roughly esti mat metric ton 
manganese prospect decidedly unpromising 
two caldas could per hap produce high cost small tonnage hand sort ore average percent manganese 
mercury deposit quindlo bermellon west central tolima one know commercial possibility 
their output past may aggregate metric ton ore whose grade remain unknown 
certain geological possibility explain report offer reasonable hope modest production future 
mica excellent quality muscovite white phlogopite amber may procure size large size many place 
however neither variety could profitably exploit condition price prevail 
molybdenum prospect scatter six departamentos numerous tolima 
their abundance suggest metallogenic province commercial ore body could expect none know showing molybdenite offer promise readily lead either single large deposit cluster small deposit 
optical calcite procure one deposit cundinamarca yield pound commercial material mine 
other prospect decidedly unpromising 
platinum mine placer deposit associate gold
