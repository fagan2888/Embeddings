grain size parameter introduction grain size analysis run laboratory use rapid sediment analyzer 
this technique base fall velocity high column water 
the data next punch card feed computer head sieve 
the program provide several type data cummulative percentage statistical parameter graphic presentation 
this section include discussion parameter provide graphic presentation brief discussion finding preliminary conclusion draw aspect study 
statistical parameter quantitative evaluation comparison grain size distribution sediment sample possible use statistical parameter 
the two method determine size distribution sand size sample sieve settle tube 
both system give size data millimeter phi unit though sieve method measure physical size particle whereas settle tube measure settle velocity grain water compare settle velocity quartz sphere know size 
word small heavy mineral large light mineral may hydraulic equivalent fall size range measure settle tube two grain would measure quite different diameter sieve analysis 
graphic representation the data obtain grain size analysis may plot several way 
all method use grain size abscissa measure percentage frequency ordinate 
usual plot grain size phi unit relate logarithmically millimeter log grain diameter size unit 
the histogram bar graph height bar represent weight percent grain particular size class 
frequency curve smooth curve midpoint bar top 
these type plot pictorial representation statistical parameter cannot determine 
the cumulative curve plot add percentage succeed size grade draw smooth curve point 
arithmetic ordinate paper curve normally shape 
from size analysis cumulative curve obtain sieve settle tube method statistical parameter calculate quantitatively describe feature sediment 
the parameter certain combination parameter compare give indication sedimentary environment deposition

several line evidence support interpretation 
first majority bedforms consistently orientate steep face toward south indicate net transport direction bouma hampton bouma 1977a 
addition study quartz grain micro surface texture indicate dominantly mechanical abrasion typical aqueous transport bedform field hampton 
quartz surface microtextures commonly associate glacial action also present low cook inlet though part occur unmodified state rarely bedform field hampton
