preface this geological survey professional paper one volume series focus geology paleontology mineral resource eastern oregon western idaho southeastern washington 
the purpose ofthis series familiarize reader work complete blue mountain region emphasize region importance understand island arc process accretion allochthonous terrane 
these professional paper provide current interpretation complex island arc terrane accrete ancient north america late mesozoic era large batholith intrude accretion occur overlie cenozoic volcanic rock subsequently uplift partly strip old rock erosion 
modern island arcs well understood even less ancient arc deform metamorphose subsequently accrete continent 
learn characteristic modern arcs change significantly along across arc ax study arc fragment less satisfactory generally characterize entire arc 
for example landward trench slop arcs differ greatly depend whether material descend slab accrete slope tectonically erode process dominates apparently related volume sediment adjacent trench vector plate convergence 
addition arc aleutian broad long sediment fill forearc basin whereas other tonga kermadec forearc insular slope descend precipitously trench depth interrupt place narrow fault bound terrace 
moreover arcs erupt primarily tholeiitic igneous product throughout history tonga kermadec other aleutian long history calcalkaline tholeiitic eruptive activity 
ridge ax 
arc may narrow broad arc solomon vanuatu axial region extend form deep bathymetric sedimentary basin 
even back arc basin may different origin history development 
some mariana trough lau basin active spreading ridge whereas other aleutian basin bering sea floor ancient oceanic crust trap behind arc 
because knowledge diverse process within modern arc limit becomes even important study ancient analogue 
just nature land exposure ancient arcs provide insight sedimentary facies magmatic evolution deep crustal process study modern arcs geophysical method dredge drilling 
few ancient island arc exposure well develop extensive blue mountain province 
particularly spectacular helpful outcrop provide intensive stream erosion leave canyon wall deep snake river canyon west seven devil mountain 
most earth scientist work blue mountain region agree pre tertiary rock form one allochthonous terranes 
the importance terranes evolution circumpacific continental margin recognize decade many complex question remain 
for example circum pacific allochthonous terranes form 
how accrete continent 
what mechanisms amalgamation process terrane formation transport 
and perhaps importantly effect process mineral hydrocarbon resource

grindstone melange terrane large block limestone previously yield devonian mississippian permian fossil whereas sandstone block yield pennsylvanian fossil 
chert various limestone block contain permian radiolarian early triassic conodont 
similar range age show baker melange terrane 
for example within miller mountain melange near canyon mountain permian limestone block upper triassic chert jux 
moreover arc related rock assemblage greenhorn mountain northwest baker permian fusilinids conodont whereas oceanic assemblage east southeast baker contain conodont middle late triassic age 
pennsylvanian permian conodont limestone block near baker associate fusilinids show tethyan affinity 
pennsylvanian conodont recover limestone block near vinegar hill greenhorn mountain devonian conodont find limestone pod far north

pessagno blome chapter faunal affiniti tectonogenesis mesozoic rock blue mountain province strengthen conclusion reach earlier thayer recently vallier engebretson various pre tertiary terranes ofthe blue mountain may part ofa single island arc blue mountain island arc

geologic implication the terrane concept greatly help interpretation geologic relationship blue mountain province also lead confusion 
different terrane name propose several author vallier other brook vallier dickinson thayer brook dickinson even recently see paper volume silberling other new name propose various part parcel blue mountain province 
seem premature propose formal terrane name blue mountain region sound definition island arc terranes tie process form 
process related occur modern island arc 
unfortunately although understanding ofmodern island arc rapidly increase many question remain answered concern island arc process 
island arc major feature earth land surface mountain range mostly submerge 
for example intra oceanic part ofthe aleutian structural arc approximately mile long mile wide total area km2 mi2 
rise depth sea level floor aleutian trench sea level thick sediment accumulation trench remove trench would depths great scholl other total relief would mile foot 
addition appreciate size island arc gain insight sedimentation pattern formation ofmajor basin within arcs see example scholl other katz 
the diverse assemblages pre cenozoic rock blue mountain island arc compare areal geologically assemblages within present day intraoceanic island arc 
present however know much blue mountain island arc may destroy subduction displace region transcurrent fault 
for worker attempt unravel geologic history ofthe blue mountain province endorse suggestion ofpessagno blome volume pre tertiary rock collectively refer blue mountain island arc 
reason subdivide worker encourage use nomenclature refer blome other volume terrane name propose silberling other 
the original location blue mountain island arc dealt detail topical paper volume 
newton stanley pessagno blome volume imply suggest eastern pacific near equatorial initial location blue mountain island arc 
they may agree part dixon infer terranes pacific move northwestward lateral transport open atlantic ocean 
interpretation engebretson vallier engebretson make western pacific source region possible blue mountain island arc bring across pacific farallon plate 
this would imply devonian early jurassic connection terranes australia example new england fold belt new zealand new caledonia new guinea

abstract rich collection late triassic coral spongiomorphs provide useful new data biostratigraphic paleogeographic study western idaho northeastern oregon 
the systematic standing coral clarify new specie cyathocoenia squiresi designate 
the identification stratigraphic distribution of49 taxon ofscleractinian coral spongiomorphs wallowa mountain hell canyon locality near lewiston idaho allow comparison fauna vancouver island british columbia wrangell mountain alaska 
these data show differentiation ofearly late norian fauna 
certain characteristic coral specie useful absence diagnostic fossil recognize kerri crickmayi zone upper triassic rock 
the coelenterate fauna occur distinct horizon clearly warm shallow water origin 
although true reef structure absent coral locally form rich biostromal deposit thick association variety benthic invertebrate include mollusc echinoderm 
strong tethyan affinity ofthe coelenterate clearly evident locality much percent fauna conspecific distant counterpart alpine region ofcentral europe 
dispersal coral within triassic panthalassa sea probably facilitate presence numerous small continental volcanic island probably scatter throughout ancestral pacific 
distance islands presence ofintervening body deeper water may explain marked difference coelenterate fauna widely distribute terranes part north america 
comparison presumably contemporaneous early norian coelenterate fauna region show surprisingly little similarity 
such finding necessitate critical evaluation late triassic paleogeography perhaps examination relationship wrangellia wallowa terrane 
introduction and past work triassic coelenterate fauna ofnorth america recently receive relatively little study

after volcanic activity cease distant terranes could develop similar stratigraphic sequence similar response sea level change induce mechanism sea floor spread accompany subsidence normally affect volcanic atoll seamount 
although preliminary paleontological data present provide stimulus explore paleogeographic issue 
they necessitate rethink idea inclusion northeastern oregon adjacent idaho wrang llia terrane even question coherence single wallowa terrane 
continued structural petrographic stratigraphic study make concert detailed paleontological study 
independent study rich brachiopod mollusc echinoid crinoid fauna would allow cross check paleogeographic conclusion
