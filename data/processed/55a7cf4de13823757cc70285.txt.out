the instantaneous flow field dominate tidal periodic meteorological event mean flow order magnitude weaker either 
interpretation result suggest eastern side inlet strongly tidal dominate tidal ellipsis extremely elongate 
central portion inlet prevail hydrodynamic regime still tidal dominated surface tidal current ellipsis round rotary 
shortterm meteorological event may contribute significantly mean flow still order magnitude weaker tidal flow 
western side tidal ellipses elongate overall tidal current strength weaker however mean flow constituent highly significant act normal estuarine mode 
the overall circulation therefore exhibit several distinct water mass boundary accompany flow discontinuity 
these boundary often mark distinct foam line associate debris

such storm exhibit mean wind range kts significant wave height approximate range foot fig 
the yearly distribution storm although base upon select data carsola report data month central low cook inlet dame moore suggest weak bimodality extreme storm activity

evans cite viva voce harold searby national weath service noaa anchorage state storm wind kts occur mostly winter wind kt could occur

these time range hour 
carsola generate estimate significant wave parameter mean wind spectra data tustamena calculate maximum fetch distance site locate anchor point 
hi maximum estimate fetch length ssw direction site 
use modified mile phillips component spectrum method calculate significant wave height excess occur late winter early spring middle late summer height excess occur 
also estimate wind generate wave period group second figure table 
this simulated wave spectrum allow swell enter gulf alaska carsola acknowledge large swell may capable reach site near anchor point pass shelikof strait although actual width window small 
inspection figure show large swell gulf alaska propagate region geoprobe deployment site gd without major loss energy move kennedy entrance 
the barren islands inhibit swell refraction around island would severely diminish wave move inlet via stevenson entrance 
the large swell enter via kennedy would slightly refract kenai peninsula thus able reach site energy intact 
another dominant swell direction would wave move shelikof 
therefore small window exist propogation large gulf alaska swell 
addition swell southeasterly wind blow gulf together blow inlet shelikof strait region allow development significant wind generate wave 
although two directional window narrow consider fetch length sufficient length allow nearly fully developed wind wave generate hour mean wind estimate appropriate large storm fig 
give minimum mean steady wind speed knot minimum duration hour unlimited fetch deep water wave forecasting chart plate ippen show wave height period could generate fetch nautical mile 
although maximum wave height foot report dame moore two storm august september thus comparable height average storm generate significant wave height would less due refraction loss frictional loss wave propagate narrow window 
similar wave height small period may generate result flood tidal current steepen wind generate wave move southward front wind north 
thus unreasonable expect storm wave height period sec reflect typical storm activity central cook inlet 
summary subjectively possible expect yearly basis percent time large storm activity present within inlet may affect mobility bottom sediment 
the extreme condition term sediment 
transport would occur storm wind wave come probability time conjunction spring tide percent lunar cycle yield overall probability extreme sediment motion year 
these probability likely factor low due probable post storm return flow generate excess water mass force upper portion inlet wind 
these storm surge large mean flow together spring tide would lengthen overall time maximum sediment mobility least factor time 
thus overall maximum sediment transport frequency yearly basis might expect percent time 
base upon previous qualitative analysis reasonable assume wave generate large gulf alaska storm large low pressure system subjectively estimate sustain significant wave height foot period second
