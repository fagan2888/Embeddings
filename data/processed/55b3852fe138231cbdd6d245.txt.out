deduction from the comparison rate orogeny and denudation base preceding conclusion rate orogeny rapid relation maximum rate denudation possible reconsider classic geologic geomorphic problem relative hillslopes peneplains effect isostastic adjustment denudation landforms 
the erosion cycle davis assumption rapid uplift mountain range allow little erosion modification area cessation uplift support 
shorter contribution general geology 
extent disparity rate uplift denudation 
depend rock type rapidly uplifted block may either little modified stream incision significantly modify 
nonetheless uplift stop channel incision occur maximum rate 
the uplifted area therefore would youthful stage geomorphic development begin davisian cycle 
however isostatic adjustment cycle erosion uplift reoccur perhaps intermittently throughout much cycle 
this extend duration complicate cycle basic principle evolution landforms youthful topography change 
hillslopes channel incision occur rapid rate uplift cease hillslope profile reflect vary rate diastrophism suggest penck long slope form could change convex concave response waning endogenetic force uplift would cease 
spite fact rate orogeny exceed maximum denudation rate possible conceive extremely slow perhaps epeirogenic uplift 
when uplift slow area high relief denudation would maximum landforms would change relation dominant factor rapid denudation rather effect slow uplift 
uplift long continue however decrease rate denudation reduction relief might continue equalled rate slow uplift 
difficult visualize effect balance might landforms suggested uplift denudation equal equilibrium timeindependent landform develop penck wegman 
area low relief slowly uplifted rate equal less denudation rate would seem little change landscape would occur equilibrium landforms whatever might would maintain 
this conclusion believe incorrect result fallacy assume denudation rate calculate uniform lowering land surface denudation fact occur manner 
obviously force denudation compose two part hillslope erosion stream channel erosion 
channel erosion may rapid case approach rate uplift hillslope erosion much less effective lower interfluve area 
theoretically perfect balance rate uplift denudation therefore manifest channel incision extension drainage pat 
mescheryakov example attribute recent channel erosion south russian steppe contemporary uplift 
attempt relate hillslope form interaction rate uplift denudation penck seem misguide view importance factor orogeny determine hillslope form 
variation hillslope form area homogenous material best explain result available relief glock schumm 1956a erosion process schumm 
the data present show uplift orogenic area rapid 
fact figure curve show maximum denudation rate reach average rate uplift foot per year relief well foot 
difference hillslope form result disparity uplift denudation probably result difference two component denudation rate channel incision hillslope erosion 
for example rock resistant channel incision relatively much great hillslope erosion narrow canyon form 
when rock less resistant weather erosion upper slope form convex profile 
more easily erode material pas initially convex straight possibly concave profile relatively rapid succession 
this evolution note badlands schumm 1956a erosion channel slop proceeds rapid rate 
time independent equilibrium landforms probably cannot result theoretical balance uplift denudation 
time independent form develop would result rapid channel incision response rapid uplift 
for example uplift rapid large amount initial channel incision form convex hillslopes channel deepen continue rock easily erode steep straight slope result may maintain angle typical material strahler 
again slope observe badland area channel incision slope erosion rapid schumm 
conclusion although slow uplift cannot neglect entirely rapid uplift probably rule orogenic area existence mountains attest 
rate uplift orogenic region always exceed denu dation rate hillslope form reflect relation uplift denudation 
far theoretical balance rate uplift denuda tion would reflect channel incision rather equilibrium landforms 
disparity between present rate denudation and orogeny 
peneplanation some question raise regard cycle erosion also regard peneplain 
for example gilluly conclusion diastrophism periodic almost continuous time use evidence uninterrupted evolution landforms cycle erosion deduce davis 
this objection also level concept peneplanation thornbury 
however gilluly qualified statement indicate location diastrophic movement continually change 
this shift location crucial point connection period stability occur give tectonic area pediment peneplain may form period stability long enough 
davis estimate million year require planation fault block mountain utah 
assume sitter period million year relative quiescence follow short period diastrophism cycle erosion must run course peneplanation must occur within million year 
the upper estimate davis close maximum allowable time need long period stability introduces element implausible 
eecent estimate time involve peneplanation involve much short period without isostatic readjustment continental united state could reduce base level million year gilluly 
this figure one twentieth allowable time correction isostatic readjustment erosion mass rock make 
this extremely important factor may increase time required peneplanation factor five much 
for example holmes considers reduce land surface foot erosion foot material would require would foot isostatic adjustment erosion 
gilluly calculation time require planation mountain area area kilometer elevation allow erosion time volume exist mountain area owe isostatic uplift 
consider isostatic factor gilluly conclude million year necessary planation 
use denudation rate present table figure calculate time require peneplanation necessary consider square mile area component large area 
possible visualize series basin aline form mountain range 
assume model mountain range compose foot relief 
possible calculate time require peneplanation use change rate denudation show figure 
however difficult know amount denudation require peneplanation 
appear mountain block uplift foot denudation may need remove foot rock adjacent lowland build deposition sediment mountain erode 
this complication show figure 
let assume foot rock must erode peneplanation 
rate denundation square mile drainage basin average except basin within inch range effective precipitation fall within million year time limit peneplanation table column 
less foot denudation require peneplanation would fall within time limit 
the small drainage basin square mile require much less time planation expect table 
from figure curve possible obtain denudation rate lower mountain range foot

denudation rate foot foot per year average rate million year require reduction foot relief 
isostatic compensation require fold adjustment peneplanation occur million year 
curve obtain sediment yield small drainage basin fig 
curve average denudation rate foot foot per year 
rate peneplanation would require million year 
these period time seem short enough make peneplanation distinct possibility geologic past 
much ignore analysis example effect uplift climate area vegetative change geologic time 
nevertheless denudation occur maximum rate foot per year area foot relief would reduce base level million year 
denudation and isostasy isostatic adjustment erosion occur continuously denudation earth crust behaves fluid 
the crust considerable strength locally gunn isostatic adjustment occur strength exceed removal rock denudation 
indeed even strength exceed may lag isostatic adjustment occur allow submergence glaciate land follow melt pleistocene

addition isostatic adjustment retreat pleistocene ice sheet episodic lougee 
this adjustment may explain simply assume isostatic adjustment accompany period rapid melt ice uplift occur pause deglaciation 
however one may object simple explanation ground pulse rapid isostatic adjustment follow rapid melt lag about2 year charlesworth 
many field study indicate discontinuous episode uplift occur mountain range 
for example wahlstrom state uplift front range colorado present elevation result single upheaval 
the presence less poorly developed terrace canyon well developed terrace valley east mountain suggest intermittent uplift 
general discussion multiple terrace step erosion surface assume formed uplift alone raise subject role isostatic adjustment denudation factor formation 
whether isostatic adjustment denudation occur give area depend local strength earth crust 
any one three condition adjustment may prevail give area mechanical equilibrium whereby rigid crust capable support uncompensated load isobar equilibrium whereby regional compensation load unloading isostatic equilibrium whereby local compensation load unloading occurs along fracture crust hsu 
compensation deglaciation isobar whereas compensation denudation generally isostatic 
the episodic nature isostatic adjustment deglaciation disparity rate uplift denudation orogenic area suggest isostatic adjustment denudation also episodic 
when initial diastrophisni occur uplift relatively rapid equilibrium approach 
orogeny cease denudation proceed slow rate strength crust exceed rapid isostatic adjustment occur 
this relation show diagrammatically figure 
the orogeny raise area foot follow orogeny denudation rate increase maximum followed decline relief lower 
this orderly sequence event interrupt short period isostatic adjustment follow denudation rate increase maximum 
result solely isostasy succeed uplifts reach altitude initial uplift due 
mountain building process 
relation denudation isostasy exist topographic form many mountain range due episode isostatic uplift well postorogenic uplift discuss pannekoek 
depend strength crust give area recurrent isostatic adjustment may long delayed large frequent small magnitude 
renew tectonism interrupt epicycle denudation uplift tectonism cease initial uplift sequence erosion isostatic adjustment may consider analogous positive feedback system 
initial uplift increase denudation rate turn increase tendency uplift removal material per unit area exceed strength crust isostatic adjustment occur cycle begin 
these epicycle within cycle erosion occur component system denudation isostatic adjustment operate greatly different rate 
these epicycle real may partly explain occurrence multiple terrace multiple warp erosion surface piedmontreppen 
for example king pugh attributed multiple scarp erosion surface form western southern africa period isostatic adjustment cause retreat major scarp long distance sea coast 
with precede hypothesis mind instructive compare condition isostatic adjustment young old mountain range 
most young mountain range rockies alps andes himalayas deficiency mass depth cause bouguer anomaly milligals mgal 
this deficiency compensate mass mountain sea level young mountain isostatic balance 
the old erode mountain range appalachians however small deficiency mass although bouguer anomaly may mgal mass deficiency large many case require isostatic compensation 
result isostatic anomaly approximately mgal may obtain indicate erosion reduction elevation area proceed faster readjustment compensate mass depth jacob russell wilson 
would possible conclude quotation denudation work faster uplift data review disprove even figure show long period geologic time denudation continue uplift dormant

the rapid rate orogeny contrast denudation valley cut make unlikely hillslope form use decipher earth recent diastrophic history 
rather form hillslope profile area high relief probably reflect difference rate channel incision hillslope erosion 
because denudation two component channel hillslope erosion operate much different rate balance rate denudation uplift yield time independent equilibrium landforms 
relatively rapid rate denudation make peneplanation likely event condition probably common geologic past
