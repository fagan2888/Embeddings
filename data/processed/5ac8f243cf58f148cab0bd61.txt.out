correspondence chicken orient use magnetic compass rafael freire1 ursula munro2 lesley rogers1 roswitha wiltschko3 wolfgang wiltschko3 although behavioural experiment show wide range animal use earth magnetic field compass orientation evidence conditioning experiment prove elusive 
bird two successful attempt operant condition magnetic stimulus involve magnetic anomaly rather change magnetic direction 
use young domestic chick motivation locate hide social stimulus demonstrate first condition magnetic compass response bird show ability orient use magnetic cue retain thousand year domestication 
eight layer strain domestic chick imprint red table tennis ball subsequently train locate ball hidden behind one four screen 
north east south west corner square arena figure 
each chick release centre arena search ball hide behind one screen 
after find ball remain one minute reward chick return home pen arena rotate 
the chick introduce approximately minute arena next trial locate reward 
train continue chick approach ball without deviation three consecutive training trial criterion 
unrewarded test ball hide behind screen follow recorded direction first screen chick walk behind

the axial response chick contrast bird test magnetic compass orientation migratory passerine well home pigeon normally show unimodal magnetic response 
the magnetic compass avian specie inclination compass base axial course field line instead polarity bird interpret inclination field line obtain unequivocal information magnetic direction 
our chick however distinguish correct opposite direction thus make impossibly decide whether compass mechanism also inclination compass 
the axial response per seem suggest primarily axial mechanism like inclination compass rather mechanism respond magnetic polarity 
not distinguish correct opposite direction may indicative difficulty orient artificial test arena may reflect transient stage development orientation system 
seem possible mechanism allow bird distinguish two end magnetic field line require certain time mature 
young chick additional orientation cue like landmark would available help overcome initial problem orientation 
development brain function chicken well know find may assist 
neurobiological analysis avian magnetic compass 
the two previous successful study use strong anomaly stimuli remain unclear magnetic parameter change intensity local gradient local change direction cause condition response 
use social reward rather food reward could induce strong directional tendency thus demonstrate first condition magnetic compass response avian specie 
domestic chicken belong ancient lineage bird separate modern bird already creataceous period magnetic compass interest also phylogenetic point view particular largely ground live normally cover large distance 
time persistence mechanism thousand year domestication remarkable emphasise important role magnetic compass orientation even nonmigratory specie
