discussion and interpretation the predominance fine silt clay size material rise slope sample typical deep water environment 
the abundance diatoms biogenic component slope rise sediment reflect nutrient rich upwelled water handa tanoue 
deposit condition environment low stand sea level pleistocene probably would appreciably different present day condition 
this however true shelf shelf break sand zone canyon head 
the fine sediment northern section shelf may indicate relict sediment low sea level stand diluted fine material follow flood shelf 
this interpretation consistent high percentage biogenic grain mostly diatoms find sediment cover area fig 
alternatively area may sediment sink owe differential basin subsidence carlson 
the zone coarse sediment shelf edge canyon head could reflect part deposition time low sea level shoreline near area karl carlson 
individual sand zone canyon head distinguish large sand wave set incline bed cover area great km2 thick this sand could accumulate mouth stream cross expose continental shelf 
alternatively sand zone might reflect modern process supply sufficient energy winnow sediment site 
the bering slope current flow northwestward parallel shelf break internal wave may focus adjacent head submarine canyon potential mechanism supply energy winnow sediment 
pattern biogenic constituent percent suggest submarine canyon influence current system shelf thereby influence sedimentation fig 
these pattern similar regional variation total suspend matter karl carlson press 
the primary textural pattern shelf probably reflect pelagic deposit environment since holocene transgression 
the band relatively coarse sediment along outer shelf upper slope may reflect material deposit small glacial stream shoreline low stand sea level pleistocene 
this relict sediment presently dilute modem fine 
grain sediment sufficient energy shelf break maintain coarse nature zone relative shallower part shelf deep part slope 
preliminary analysis seismic stratigraphy navarin basin province fact present day fluvial source away support hypothesis 
the large submarine canyon seem affect deposition shelf control current regime indicate pattern biogenic material shelf
