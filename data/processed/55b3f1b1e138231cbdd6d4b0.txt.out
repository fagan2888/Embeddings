once anticline syncline fold couple associate bear valley fault form minor compression displacement cease bear valley fault 
the poison creek thrust fault splay near base bear valley fault thrust imbricate proceed develop major thrust fault propagate northeastward along bed southwest dip limb basin lake syncline
