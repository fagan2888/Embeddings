individual down syndrome inherit extra copy chromosome 
cause down syndrome figure 
down syndrome encompasses wide array trait include characteristic facial feature hear vision impairment heart abnormalities mild moderate intellectual disability 
each trait show vary degree express penetrance 
variability severity trait proportion individual exhibit 
for example people down syndrome may relatively minor heart defect defect 
these individual excite geneticist suggest nature uncovered mean ameliorating perturbation would otherwise cause severe disease phenotype 
understand socalled protective allele may lead new therapy buffer harmful effect aneuploidy form copy number variation 
recent publication hose colleague explore whether individual case natural isolates 
yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae could tolerate aneuploidy good other speciﬁcally commonly used laboratory strain 
the author reason suspect might case 
first several lab include find aneuploidy relatively common wild strain 
aneuploidy also common pathogenic fungi particularly strain isolate drug treat host 
finally aneuploidy routinely find laboratory experiment perform wild derived strain yeast 
these result beg question aneuploidy strong negative consequence common natural isolates 
one possible explanation aneuploidy detrimental wild strain one might predict study lab strain 
test hypothesis hose colleague compare aneuploid wild strain genetically similar euploid non aneuploid wild strain 
yeast grow slowly 
sick stress growth defect associate speciﬁc expression pattern relatively large set rna transcript environmental stress response gene esr 
several study show aneuploid laboratory yeast strain often exhibit slow growth condition induce esr 
contrast aneuploid wild yeast strain study hose 
display little growth defect fail induce esr 
why might cell tolerate imbalanced chromosome copy number well 
one possibility aneuploidy somehow advantageous cell tolerance speciﬁc aneuploidy select 
there number example presence extra chromosome chromosome confers selective advantage cell speciﬁc condition 
for example aneuploidy quickly arise experiment examine response laboratory yeast strain heat stress provide growth advantage sufﬁcient overcome general loss ﬁtness also associate presence extra copy chromosome three 
study examine panel yeast strain different chromosome imbalance indicate condition suboptimal growth euploid strain aneuploid grow well euploid counterpart 
aneuploidy also arise frequently clinical isolates pathogenic fungi confer resistance antifungal drug 
interestingly individual down syndrome low risk develop many type cancer suggest aneuploidy also beneﬁcial effect human 
aneuploid wild strain yeast derived selective advantage speciﬁc aneuploidy harbor strain would selective pressure minimize negative effect associate chromosome imbalance 
that wild yeast strain may beneﬁt adapt aneuploid state 
contrast laboratory strain recently become aneuploid may yet adapt state effectively 
adaptation wild strain could either general effect confer resistance negative effect many even

aneuploid state could speciﬁc adaptation current chromosome imbalance 
adaptation speciﬁc force wild strain acquire new aneuploid state 
copy number imbalance different chromosome would deleterious growth laboratory strain 
surprisingly hose colleague find case 
wild isolates yeast also resistant negative effect newly acquire aneuploidy suggest possess general rather chromosome speciﬁc tolerance aneuploidy 
selection generalize aneuploidy tolerance suggest ability transition multiple aneuploid state offer cell substantial beneﬁt 
single cell eukaryote yeast could take form rapid adaptation ﬂuctuating environmental condition different aneuploidy provide selective advantage different time 
importantly contrast spontaneous mutation aneuploidy gain lose relatively high frequency 
this reversibility make aneuploidy particularly useful strategy micro organism adapt rapidly change rare environmental condition 
way small proportion cell harbor variety aneuploidy could serve bet hedge strategy cell well able weather severe environmental perturbation 
those individual would relatively easy mean revert previous state favorable condition return new condition persist aneuploidy could maintain efﬁcient response selection evolves 
thus appear microorganisms ability tolerate aneuploidy beneﬁt phenotypic plasticity confer 
but could true human cell 
aneuploidy common cancer cell may driver cellular transformation increase expression oncogene relative tumor suppressor result 
disorder cellular process associate tumor cell 
once aneuploid selective pressure tolerance aneuploidy could apply cell 
surprisingly several report also measure high frequency aneuploid cell normal human mouse tissue include report hepatocytes neuron variety speciﬁc aneuploidy observe 
however recent study use single cell sequence across variety tissue find prevalence aneuploidy liver brain low 
the continued improvement dna sequence technology include method whole genome sequence single cell situ soon facilitate experiment scale sufﬁcient deﬁnitively address prevalent mammalian mosaic aneuploidy really 
aneuploidy exist appreciable frequency mammalian tissue next question must aneuploid cell carry specialized function 
mechanism general speciﬁc tolerance aneuploidy may exist human microorganism
