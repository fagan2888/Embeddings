geological survey department the interior national water quality assessment program upper snake river basin 
background geological survey usgs begin implement full scale national water quality assessment nawqa program 
the long term goal nawqa program describe status trend quality large representative part nation surface groundwater resource provide sound scientific understanding primary natural human factor affect quality resource 
meeting goal program produce wealth water quality information useful policy maker manager national state local level 
major design feature nawqa program enable water quality information different areal scale integrate 
major component program study unit investigation comprise principal building block program national level assessment activity base 
the program study unit hydrologic system include principal river basins aquifer system throughout nation 
these study unit cover area square mile incorporate 6ft percent nation water use population serve public water supply 
upper snake river basin among first nawqa study unit select study fullscale implementation plan

major water quality issue almost half stream segment study unit assessed water quality condition idaho department health welfare affect nonpoint source activity 
the primary nonpoint source activity irrigate nonirrigated agriculture graze streamflow regulation dam diversion recreation 
primary point source activity agricultural related industry municipal wastewater treatment facility mine related industry aquaculture 
water quality lakes reservoir study unit affect primarily agricultural aquacultural related activity 
ground water contamination various point nonpoint source generally confine area acres several square mile extent 
common point source contamination petroleum storage tank industrial chemical leak spill application wastewater land 
ground water contamination nonpoint source poorly understood inadequate nonexistent monitoring data 
sparse data indicate however apply agricultural chemical leach ground water system localize area 
specific water quality issue include elevated concentration sediment nutrient occurrence low dissolve oxygen elevated water temperature surface water associate agriculture graze aquaculture result degrade water quality impairment beneficial us water tributary basin along snake river potential ground water contamination nutrient pesticide associated agricultural activity intensively irrigate area potential surface ground water contamination nutrient recreational activity upper part study unit
