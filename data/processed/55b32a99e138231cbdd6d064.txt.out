stratigraphic relation the navajo sandstone middle jurassic formation southern utah and northern arizona fred peterson pipiringos 
stratigraphic study southern utah northern arizona indicate navajo sandstone intertongue overlie middle jurassic carmel formation 
two crossbedded sandstone body previously think tongue navajo carmel instead entirely separate navajo 
addition regional unconformity present base carmel equivalent formation 
thus navajo predominantly crossbedded sandstone formation top glen canyon group intertongue carmel formation 
early jurassic palynomorphs discover moenave formation base glen canyon group southwestern utah northwestern arizona 
these fossil indicate moenave well overlie kayenta navajo formation likely early jurassic age considerably glen canyon group early jurassic thought 
however geological survey still consider navajo triassic 
jurassic age pending study plant fossil 
the temple cap sandstone southwestern utah formerly consider member top navajo sandstone give formation rank include old formation san rafael group lie beneath carmel formation 
the temple cap divide two newly name member sinawava member white throne member 
the sinawava base formation flat bed consist sandstone silty sandstone mudstone whereas overlie white throne member consist crossbedded sandstone 
the white throne grade westward sinawava vicinity hurricane cliff west hurricane cliff sinawava member present 
contrary previous report white throne tongue navajo instead white throne member separate navajo sinawava member neither member merges navajo 
addition lower contact sinawava term surface may unconformity laterally continuous surface mark broad irregularity may cause erosion process 
this surface correlative similar surface northeastern utah adjacent part idaho wyoming consider unconformity 
the temple cap unfossiliferous assign early middle jurassic age basis correlation fossiliferous gypsum spring member twin creek limestone north central utah 
regional erosion surface term unconformity bevel temple cap sandstone southwestern utah navajo sandstone southeastern utah northeastern arizona 
this surface mark thin layer small chert pebble lag concentrate chert nodule pebble derive underlying formation

these correlation indicate upper member carmel formation middle jurassic age 
introduction and acknowledgment stratigraphic study colorado plateau past several decade yield anomalous stratigraphic relationship navajo sandstone overlie carmel formation
