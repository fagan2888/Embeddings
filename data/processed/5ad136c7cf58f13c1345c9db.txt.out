above represent total size population food available per caput smooth approximation step function parameterises require minimum food availability people change activity towards monument building control steepness step function 
the model interpreted follow people bear certain agricultural specialisation determine fraction give 
they harvest resource rate speciﬁc specialisation 
proportional swidden intensive agriculture 
the harvested amount provide food surplus positively aﬀects population growth rate 
harvest insuﬃcient meet basic requirement per capita population start decrease 
leave alone land productive capacity regenerates within characteristic time year give patch harvest consecutive year use intensive practice crop failure 
thus exist negative feedback loop population environment reﬂecting malthusian mechanism 
high availability resource lead high population lead rapid depletion resource base later impact growth rate population 
see due land overuse increase number worker intensive agriculture lead loss production capacity long term subsequently demographic decline 
food available per caput high part swidden worker move monument construction 
monument build proportion number builder available also decay slowly time 
harvest poor yield builder back practice agriculture compensate 
thus high agricultural yield lead high population high rate monument building 
the building monument direct eﬀect population within scope model 
next outline feature model precisely 
the ﬁrst three equation model dictate population dynamic 
the parameter set scale ﬁrst two term represent natality birth death rate 
the ﬁrst term equation represent crude birth rate assume proportional total population available food per caput parameter represent proportion new generation respective occupation 
birth rate often assumed literature proportional present population turchin 2003a also monotonically increase function food per caput anderies motesharrei 
the parameter add interpreted prevalence popularity swidden intensive agricultural activity society 
addition conventional aspect birth rate feature binary parameter either set onset intensive agriculture onset thus model rapid change parameter see section detail 
the next term equation population dynamic death rate also assume proportional population size 
natural candidate death rate dependence food availability food population would quickly decline zero mean death rate would grow large even diverge 
for example death rate proportional previously use world2 model forrester 
the last term population equation diﬀusion term model movement people two diﬀerent specialisation swidden agriculture monument building 
monument build take place surplus production exist support 
speciﬁcally food availability high enough surplus production exist support non agriculturally related activity shift work purely subsistence base agriculture monument building model via diﬀusion term 
once people move diﬀuse practice swidden agriculture building monument 
opposite eﬀect occurs 
the parameter represent diﬀusion coeﬃcient upper bound cannot population ﬂow within year 
use value determine numerical optimisation see section imply population give specialisation change diﬀerent occupation within year condition availability food discuss 
the movement specialisation typically take place much rapidly short timescale demographic growth specialisation 
this lead make two simplify assumption model 
first equation feature birth rate term second movement via diﬀusion intensive agriculture 
regard ﬁrst simpliﬁcation possible set prevalence parameter monument building activity zero signiﬁcantly aﬀect model dynamic 
the birth rate term variable number builder would dominate diﬀusion dynamic 
because chose eliminate one parameter prevalence monument building set zero 
the second simpliﬁcation justiﬁed movement intensive agriculture require large initial investment undertaken allocation land building terrace etc 
therefore unlikely intensive practice pick quickly 
due sunk cost eﬀects janssen large investment make unlikely activity immediately abandon alternative 
hence decide implement diﬀusion mechanism towards away intensive agriculture 
the fourth equation 
model resource dynamic 
the ﬁrst term follow usual logistic dynamic describes resource recover time second term capture harvest activity population 
the production capacity renewable resource regenerate characteristic timescale year consistent typical time harvest swidden agriculture turner 
left unexploited resource return maximum value within matter decade 
this likely also happen reality collapse maya environment today good condition turner sabloﬀ 
the maya employ wide range agricultural technique turner attempt capture full complexity endeavour 
the work turner suggest agricultural practice polarise two category short two year long decade cycle 
thus simplicity distinguish two category swidden agriculture full harvesting cycle year intensive practice cycle year 
intensive practice equate short fallow swidden agriculture represent aggregated activity diverse type method use 
the average amount land per year person require fulﬁl caloric need turner 
hence measure food production capacity land hectares set initial value size region model 
presence human population production capacity decrease proportion number agricultural worker productivity 
take productivity per caput swidden agriculture year pers minimum value meet subsistence need 
for intensive agriculture harvest take place annually reﬂected model assign productivity time higher swidden practice 
the depletion parameter choose average number consecutive time piece land harvest completely deplete intensive practice time 
soil high 
ecological economics 
productivity less prone erosion one find yucatan peninsula harvest maximum consecutive year still give good yield usda survey 
our choice thus reﬂects optimistic low bound depletion rate maya environment 
wilk highlight fact even good soil quality enjoy mopan community san antonio serious problem start emerge fallow cycle shorten ﬁve year less 
depletion case refers amount food produce crop harvest strictly refer state soil 
soil depletion vary widely throughout lowland beach dun variation complex issue capture simple model 
when production capacity high resource extract per worker roughly constant depend type agricultural activity 
this assumption previously use model easter island basener ross basener warfare dynamic turchin 
nevertheless production capacity land decrease threshold maximum productive land become increasingly sparse lead decrease food production per caput 
this dynamic implemented exponential term deﬁnition food availability per caput see 
when extraction term natural resource becomes ﬁrst order predator prey term find lotkavolterra model type functional response 
because parameter signal scarcity food expect numerical optimisation value determine 
particular feature resource dynamic eﬀect precipitation 
the absolute level rainfall relevant model important relative variation amount water impact diﬀerent parameter model 
there three aspect directly relate rainfall rate resource regeneration maximum amount productive land iii extraction term natural agricultural resource 
reduction amount available water reduce rate regeneration environment allow recovery small carrying capacity also impede eﬀorts exploit 
the propose model account three eﬀects 
for simplicity assume eﬀects linearly proportional relative amount precipitation time thus normal precipitation condition correspond 
deviation assumption explore appendix fig 
diﬀerent area lowlands subject diﬀerent exogenous factor besides precipitation also include volcanic ash tankersley 
the eﬀect exogenous contribution environmental recovery volcanic ash incorporate model similar way precipitation 
thus interpret precipitation scale factor aggregate external eﬀects resource recovery use 
for clarity variable interpreted agricultural production capacity land logistic equation growth represent dynamic renewable resource could equally represent forest resource 
also term model dictate resource exploitation univocal regard interpretation 
strictly say distinguish low intensity high intensity resource extraction 
for concreteness associate low intensity activity swidden agriculture high intensity activity intensive agriculture 
the factor intensities extraction activity take match relative diﬀerence annual harvesting swidden practice might see one instance wide variety low high impact environmental activity 
thus variable generally interpret aggregate renewable resource include output agriculture forestry ﬁshing 
then extraction activity see exploitation set resource positive eﬀect birth rate
