introduction ubiquitous carbonate deposit travertine conglomerate cement occur within low kilometer warnick canyon coast range colusa county california figure 
the deposit locate ephemeral streambed crop west flank canyon 
carbonate specimen collect site location order study mineralogy chemical composition morphology 
water either spring contact carbonate deposit flow streambed collect site near carbonate deposit
