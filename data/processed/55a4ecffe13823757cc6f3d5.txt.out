this increase erosion correlate construction relatively small marina facility within reach 
the emplacement breakwater jetty system continue removal dredged sediment marina entrance appear major contribute factor recent increase erosion rate 
introduction development coastal area increase accurate measurement historical shoreline change become prerequisite coastal management 
recent erosion rate historical storm response provide scientific basis formulate sound coastal management policy 
for example recent erosion rate presently use several state locate oceanfront construction setback line storm response data use establish post storm reconstruction regulation 
addition quantitative erosion rate data give coastal manager advantage make proactive rather reactive policy decision 
experience show reactive inappropriate decision coastal zone deleterious economic social environmental consequence

discussion there several factor help explain spatial temporal variability shoreline change study area 
these include geomorphologic factor well human induce perturbation system 
the trend four shoreline reach underlying cause discuss 
reach the shoreline reach high wave energy study area 
nonetheless long term year trend indicate stable shoreline table 
this relative stability due part rocky nature shoreline 
show figure portion shoreline compose recent beachrock deposit 
addition exposure pleistocene eolianite kaye extend northward punta ensenada several hundred meter 
near punta higuero metasedimentary rock adjacent mountain either crop form shallow terrace like subcrop along shoreline 
along reach shoreline compose purely sandy substrate 
fact beach amount small prism sand migrate back forth across slowly erode surface rock unit net landward trend 
reach contrast reach shoreline reach compose almost entirely unconsolidated sandy alluvial sediment 
figure show well develop scarp present along southern part reach 
give relatively low rate sediment supply rocky coast reach shoreline erosion probably contribute majority new sediment beach system 
reach also site large human alteration coastal system study area 
specifically appear marina build directly indirectly responsible increase erosion 
the marina probably several impact adjacent downdrift reach 
may seaward breakwater fig 
prevent longshore movement sand around punta ensenada reach 
this due change shoreline configuration cause breakwater 
gently curve shallow spit sand underlain rock unit eolianite 
present prior marina construction 
this set change emplacement large rock structure extend fairly deep water 
likely breakwater cause offshore deflection longshore drift deeper water return beach sediment effectively remove beach system 
the shore normal channeled nature nearshore reef system may enhance effect 
discuss proximity shelf break area probably result significant loss sediment offshore 
there also evidence breakwater change pattern nearshore sand deposition deposit sand accumulate marina entrance 
the rate sediment accumulation front marina sufficiently rapid require periodic dredging 
local observer indicate dredge material typically remove illegally use building construction 
the erosion rate reach show profound increase reach two period average rate increase 
where erosion threaten beachfront development variety gabion wall revetment 
seawall build see fig 
this response probably reduce availability new sediment system 
the following example illustrates point 
about one kilometer shoreline along reach transects erode nearly since 
much shoreline form meter high scarp unconsolidated alluvial deposit see fig 
thus erosion rate section represent volume removal approximately one kilometer shoreline alone 
relative size coastal compartment form reach volume probably significant portion entire sediment budget 
reduce sediment supply construct seawall may well result dramatic increase erosion downdrift beach reach reach for area south transect decrease erosion rate period probably result increase sediment supply erode alluvial sediment updrift southern part reach northern part reach appear beach downdrift zone maximum erosion reach benefit increased sand supply 
show figure beach quite healthy although erode long term nearly 
reach like southern portion reach reach appear benefit increase sediment supply erosion reach 
the data table indicate slightly reduce erosion rate past seven year although actual rate change low undetectable 
the generally low erosion rate probably also due part increasingly rocky nature shoreline 
like reach north many place beach small prism sand migrate across rocky substrate 
conclusion the shoreline northwestern coast puerto rico punta higiiero punta cadena erode last year 
the spatial distribution erosion rate permit shoreline divide four distinct reach north south 
the study area also experience dramatic increase erosion rate past seven year 
reach essentially stable shoreline period 
this due part rocky nature shoreline 
beachrock eolianite metasedimentary rock form low relief shallow terrace beach lie 
the beach amount small prism sand probably migrate seasonally back forth surface 
since however net trend change accretion erosion 
the shoreline reach erode rapidly rate past year 
over past seven year however approximately one kilometer shoreline erode nearly two meter high unconsolidated alluvial bluff 
this erosion probably represent significant portion sediment supply southern six kilometer study area 
reach rate erosion fairly low past year 
general northern portion reach erode rapidly southern portion beach still appear healthy 
since erosion rate southern portion reach actually decrease 
the low rate erosion probably due increase sediment supply rapidly erode shoreline far updrift 
the shoreline reach appear fairly stable 
the long term rate erosion within resolution method use study 
there detectable change trend past seven year 
field evidence however indicate low long term erosion rate 
the construction marina include two breakwater jetty entrance appear responsible dramatic increase erosion rate 
one kilometer stretch shoreline south marina entrance presently erode nearly 
this high erosion rate puerto rico 
the marina probably two effect nearshore sedimentation 
first seaward breakwater change shoreline configuration longshore drift likely deflect deep water perhaps shelf break 
second breakwater may also change nearshore wave refraction pattern 
this evidence increased sedimentation marina entrance 
the increase shoreline erosion south marina probably represent significant source new sediment littoral system 
fact rate erosion downdrift beach actually decrease since marina build 
this likely increase sediment supply due marina induce accelerated erosion 
the response increase erosion construction seawalls revetment 
this action reduce sediment supply cause increase erosion rate downdrift beach 
the present trend seawall revetment construction suggest problem worsen time
