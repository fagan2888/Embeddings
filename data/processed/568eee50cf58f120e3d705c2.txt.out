the remainder map scale standard field method interpretation remote sense image include aerial photography landsat data 
field method include examine geomorphology surface internal feature soil development 
map geology transfer aerial photograph gi digitize use mosaic digital orthophoto quadrangle

map classification mapping follow approach develop yount other describe surficial deposit accord matrix age deposit process 
unit symbol reflect breakdown age process 
however erosion environment landform surficial cover attribute described map unit symbols age generally provide environment spatially nonuniform respect age 
composite symbol surficial geologic unit commonly form thin veneer older surficial unit bedrock 
map area relation common unit label designate two unit separate slash 
the young overlie unit indicate first 
thus qya qoa indicate area veneer young alluvial fan deposit qya overlies old alluvial fan deposit qoa qya fpg indicate area veneer young alluvial fan deposit qya overlies felsic grussy granite fpg 
the lateral extent individual deposit commonly small exposure cannot show individually map scale 
area make deposit small show map scale represent area indicate unit label separate plus sign common deposit list first 
thus qya qia indicate area contains qya qia deposit qya common qia 
convention erosion environment erosion environment mountains pediment widespread consist thin surficial sediment distribute irregularly among bedrock exposure 
material mountain area largely form place weather bedrock may transport short distance mass waste fluvial process 
such material designate hillslope
