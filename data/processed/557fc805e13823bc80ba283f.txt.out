discussion the intrusive volcanic rock jabal salma delineate remarkable detail internal structure collapse proterozoic caldera represent geochemical evolution 
this evolution probably represent early tap depletion upper evolve portion zone magma chamber later rise residual dominant magma 
chemical zonation within thick ash flow tuff show feature decrease silica increase phenocryst content bottom top flow long cite evidence chemical zonation within parent magma chamber williams smith bailey hildreth 
process involve convection internal diffusion gradient develop whereby highly evolve magma occupy upper outer portion magma chamber hildreth 
early eruption evolve cap magma later hot eruption deep less evolved residual magma 
chemical zonation within individual flow sequence flow yet document jabal salma although assemblage volcanic intrusive rock reflect chemical change time probably represent tap progressively deep portion magma chamber 
eruptive rock caldera collapse the old rock salma caldera mostly peralkaline rhyolite salma caldera fill 
massive rhyolite underlies layer rhyolitic sequence probably intracaldera tuff perhaps much several kilometer thick fill caldera shortly follow collapse result rapid evacuation upper evolve portion underlie magma chamber 
large rhyolitic old granitic block represent piece caldera wall fell hot pyroclastic material 
the intracaldera tuff pond within roughly elliptical collapse caldera residual temperature remain high long enough crystallization continue thick volcanic mass 
shard structure preserve although volcanic fragment intermediate composition commonly occur 
the caldera floor underlie massive rhyolite apparently expose 
suggest layer rhyolite represent comenditic ash flow tuff emplace shortly follow main eruptive event period wan rapidly erupt volcanic pulse 
these tuff probably include least upper part massive rhyolite slump toward center caldera still hot relatively plastic produce open fold 
fold limb dip steeply near outer

questa caldera new mexico outflow sheet amelia tuff fold secondary flowage back caldera complex boundary fault lipman 
least one hiatus deposition layer volcanics streams high gradient flow probably caldera sequence represent interbedded coarse volcaniclastic conglomerate 
the upper part caldera fill well outflow tuff remove erosion cover phanerozoic rock 
discuss seem probable regional tilting caldera since formation minimal fact thick intracaldera tuff overlie layer rhyolite presently expose topographic level suggest amount collapse everywhere 
subsidence apparently hinge accompanied differential sagging produce partial trap door collapse observe calderas san juan volcanic field steven lipman 
subsidence probably great along southeast side salma caldera least relative northeast side massive intracaldera tuff crop 
these relationship also imply collapse continue eruption volcanics 
ring granite ring intrusives common feature phanerozoic caldera smith bailey 
these intrusives commonly associate post collapse domes relatively minor ash eruption intrude ring fracture form caldera collapse 
contrast post collapse feature ash flow vent intrusive rock definitely identify emplaced caldera collapse rarely identify lipman 
the peralkaline granite salma caldera crop arcuate pattern around periphery caldera fill intrudes layer rhyolite caldera fill 
contact old rock expose nearly vertical 
arcuate fault along north side caldera complex probably represent portion original ring fracture small exposure peralkaline granite along south side wadi ish suggest ring fracture enclose elliptical caldera block long major axis orient northeasterly 
the peralkaline granite rise along ring fracture form caldera collapse probably associate postcollapse volcanic rock domes flow ash fall deposit erode long ago although composition similar layer rhyolite table 
this similarity composition implies evolve presumably upper zone within magma chamber give rise layer rhyolite peralkaline granite 
the irregular pinch swell outcrop pattern peralkaline granite around north east side caldera suggest considerable portion caldera block caldera wall either assimilate raft away emplacement peralkaline granite 
detailed chemical data bear possible wall rock assimilation collect 
however peralkaline granite contains xenoliths obvious compositional gradient might expect significant wall rock assimilation occur noted peralkaline granite 
seem likely portion caldera block caldera wall may move present level erosion 
resurgent magmatism the core granite associate salma caldera intrude ago aldrich begin emplacement biotite alkali granite follow intrusion large volume alkali granophyre granophyre

the mechanism resurgence occur jabal salma well document 
numerous sheet like body granophyre intruded upper region solidify alkali granite much less extent overlie volcanic pile caldera fill 
the sheet granophyre emplace along fracture diverse orientation although commonly intrude parallel previously intrude sheet 
near contact overlie volcanic rock fig 
granophyre sheet intrude along fracture generally parallel contact produce parallel sheet sheet structure 
consequently granophyre sheet along north east south side granophyre dip outward degree 
evidence see caldera fill domed intrusion granophyre 
most measure dip within caldera fill toward center caldera contact granophyre volcanic rock high angle volcanic layering 
apparently rise magma 
follow caldera collapse accompany stop uplift although dome volcanic pile could occur central part complex volcanic rock erode 
each sheet like injection granophyre accompany sudden pressure release quench intrude liquid eutectic crystallization quartz potassium feldspar produce granophyric texture 
know whether inject sheet vent surface venting could produce pressure release necessary form granophyric texture although effect could produce pass lithostatic hydrostatic regime within upper crust 
the orientation long arc granitic intrusive rock underlie jabal salma fig 
suggests granite intrude along north northwest trend zone weakness extend well beyond areal limit overlie caldera 
intrusion granophyre also apparently symmetrical respect caldera 
most granophyre emplace central part underlie magma chamber beneath western part collapse caldera block 
magma penetrate level well present erosion level trace western half caldera block remains 
the source region granophyre probably portion magma chamber encapsulate within cool shell biotite alkali granite 
the chemical composition granophyre biotite alkali granite similar suggests compositional zone low convect portion magma chamber develop significant compositional gradient 
numerous fault cross granitic rock complex related regional east west compress stress exist throughout shield late proterozoic early cambrian time 
this stress produce conjugate fracture system northwest trending leave lateral fault najd fault system system northeast trend right lateral fault 
jabal salma northeast trend fault system apparently well developed najd fault system
