the precipitous decline budget result fragmented uranium program loss uranium geologist program 
addition large part uranium budget reprogrammed congressional decree fund environmental radon hazard study 
the program review revitalize cohesive new basic apply research effort plan 
hope maintain second core program next year next upswing uranium demand cycle 
the eia usgs mou the termination nure program closing doe grand junction operation office make apparent need transfer responsibility uranium resource assessment large collection nure data usgs 
this do memorandum understand mou energy information administration eia doe usgs sign 
the uranium resource assessment portion agreement call usgs continue exploration research develop modified nure assessment methodology carry endowment assessment select area 
these new area choose coordination eia new data become available since nure assessment make new discovery ore deposit old new district would likely result significant ton change total national potential resource

the solution collapse breccia pipe study list slide would among first expand 
fact topic list slide may become part core program 
overhead study metamorphic igneous environment also would important expand program 
could argue perhaps core program ought reorient deposit environment limitation available expertise funding dictate focus high grade deposit breccia pipe sandstone deposit locate mainly west 
overhead this slide list number new research topic could do expand program
