sample sespe divide two group one take locality stratigraphic position general remote miner one group proximal within area miner ratio remote group average proximal group average 
this relationship suggest part sespe represent remote group sample lose uranium leaching may provide uranium source deposit 
most sample designate remote group table sample reddish brown base color highly oxidize proximal group 
these sample average ppm thorium ppm uranium

ground water movement sediment would sluggish shortly deposition low hydrologic head near sea level 
this sluggishness may contributory preservation reduce environment rock 
host rock the main host rock uranium deposition fluvial sandstone bed low transitional sespe formation 
these low bed laterally intertongue nearshore marine sandstone underlie coldwater sandstone 
porosity permeability measurement make uranium host rock reasonably well sort fluvial sandstone probably reasonably high initial permeability 
the host rock part yellowish pinkish gray medium coarse grain arkosic sandstone 
reductant the uranium miner concretion commonly center around carbonize plant trash carbonaceous material may originate humate 
the carbonaceous material apparently provide reductant nearly miner associate 
stagnant reduce possibly acidic environment apparently maintain low bed sespe near marine coastline 
the humate apparently form precipitation humic substance dissolve ground water 
the physical chemical condition flocculate precipitated modern humate along florida coast may include adsorption cation complex clay colloid lower swanson palacas 
these condition may

airborne radiometric and soil gas measurement part area survey airborne radiometric instrument 
variation radiometric background level appear make data somewhat equivocal nevertheless certain generalization make dickinson frizzell morrone 
rather distinct anomaly reach ppm eugog occur payoff claim superior ridge even though background radiation level area seem relatively low 
slight radiation high also occur hartman ranch area minor uranium miner know low sespe 
the radiation high hartman ranch reach maximum ppm eugog low various anomaly scatter around area 
the coldwater sandstone project regional radiometric low

the relation highs possible uranium deposit know 
unpublished work bowles reimer helium soil gas suggest relation helium radiometric anomaly 
they suggest radiometric anomaly cause radon gas associate helium gas generate uranium deposit 
the gas migrate away rock produce reason radiometric anomaly may accurately reflect surficial geology location size uranium deposit 
elemental association for slightly mineralize mineralized rock possible determine mineralize uranium content alone 
there strong correlation uranium vanadium uranium molybdenum rock mineralize reason high vanadium molybdenum value particular sample evidence mineralize 
addition ratio low mineralize rock generally rock mineralize upper limit thorium determine millard

favorable area although minor uranium enrichment find different geologic formation ventura area know deposit potentially commercial interest superior ridge deposit 
for reason lower transitional part sespe consider potential deposit 
base uranium miner model sespe present south westerly movement uranium bearing ground water apparently encounter sufficient reductant fluvial sediment near ancestral marine coast 
for reason favorable area uranium deposition lower part sespe formation western part ventura basin 
porous channel sandstone sufficient chemical reductant predictable area include wide belt extend ojai westward pass north rincon point pacific coast 
favorable rock mostly subsurface area uranium 
exploration expensive deposit cannot find without drilling 
nevertheless industry exploration would expect part favorable area period high uranium demand 
the upper sespe creek area also favorable uranium deposit less superior ridge area 
the original discovery sample contain much percent uranium presence coldwater sespe contact presence minor radioactive anomaly vicinity hartman ranch dickinson other suggest favorable area 
certainly possibility commercial deposit cannot rule hand certain characteristic upper sespe creek area unfavorable
