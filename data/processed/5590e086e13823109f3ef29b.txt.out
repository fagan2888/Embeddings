introduction central california vicinity san francisco monterey bay history fatal damaging landslide trigger heavy rainfall coastal stream erosion construction activity earthquake 
the great san francisco earthquake generate landslide throughout area km2 keefer landslide kill least people cause substantial damage building roads railroad civil work 
small number landslide cause localized damage also report least earthquake occur san francisco bay monterey bay region since youd hoose keefer wieczorek keefer

condition make region particularly susceptible landslide include steep rugged topography weak rock soil material seasonally heavy rainfall active seismic 
give condition history surprise loma prieta earthquake generate thousand landslide throughout region 
landslide cause one fatality damage least residence numerous road many structure 
direct damage landslides probably exceed million additional indirect 
economic loss cause long term landslide blockage two major highway delay rebuild brought concern potential long term instability earthquake damage slope 
the loma prieta earthquake provide first relatively complete data set landslide generate earthquake size central california 
previous landslide produce earthquake region except event either much small poorly document accurately assess landslide effect 
the paper chapter discuss many aspect earthquake induce landsliding range determination overall distribution landslide detailed analysis individual slope failure 
many aspect consistent result previous analysis base largely data region 
therefore many slope fail earthquake could identify susceptible landsliding use exist criterion technique example keefer wieczorek other wilson keefer keefer wilson 
several aspect landsliding however historical analog thus lead new conclusion concern generation landslide seismic event 
among new conclusion many ground crack throughout epicentral region cause incipient landslide movement seismic generate landslide may important contributor longterm coastal erosion area ground crack adjacent fault rupture may produce landslide substantially large complex produce great distance fault shake alone many ground crack associate landslide near fault rupture show evidence previous movement thus may detectable subsurface investigation slope stability analysis base material strength measure small diameter sample may underestimate actual earthquake induce landslide displacement 
the first three paper chapter discuss various facet regional distribution landslide overall distribution characteristic coastal landslide generation landslide dam 
the next four paper discuss large complex landslide generate near 
rupture zone include overall characterization analysis relation ground crack produce process landsliding subsurface investigation document previous movement history use well document feature calibrate method dynamic slope stability analysis 
other chapter volume also discuss topic closely related landslide soil liquefaction produce type landslide describe see rourke holzer press ground crack near rupture zone ponti press

more percent earthquake induce landslide occur southwest fault rupture almost certainly fault separate group rock significantly different property 
addition crack associate clearly define landslide earthquake open crack hundred ridgetops hillside throughout southern santa cruz 
coastal landslide outside santa cruz mountains landslide occur along long stretch central california coast fig

griggs plant chapter discus coastal landslide emphasis northern monterey bay area landslide abundant 
coastal landslide damage imperiled residence structure bluff top beach area base bluff 
addition fully develop landslide earthquake generate crack bluff top much inland bluff face raise question long term stability many site 
griggs plant chapter note seismic failure coastal bluff may hazard widely recognize planning construction coastal area 
this absence recognition derive common practice base construction setback hazard mitigation procedure calculate long term average rate bluff erosion 
because period record data may short include major well document earthquake contribution earthquake induced failure may take account 
our experience loma prieta earthquake thus use improve recognition mitigation hazard coastal area 
landslide dam another effect earthquake trigger landslide formation landslide dams santa cruz mountains describe schuster other chapter

although two possible analog landslide generate previous earthquake discuss harp chapter landslide extremely rare historical record 
thus landslides summit ridge area represent newly recognize type landslide hazard along fault trace

trench investigation trench investigation design determine subsurface characteristic movement history ground crack describe nolan weber chapter 
their study include detailed analysis feature observe two postearthquake trench synthesis data previous preearthquake postearthquake trenching investigation summit ridge area 
one trench study detail excavate across well define main scarp large landslide excavate across ground crack could relate landsliding tectonic deformation 
both trench reveal feature indicative least four displacement event include loma prieta earthquake 
these event occur within time period approximately year one place approximately year 
one movement event one crack probably associate san francisco earthquake 
from analysis trench investigation nolan weber chapter conclude ground crack show extension vertical displacement attributable loma prieta earthquake also show clear subsurface evidence previous movement 
they also find although ground crack previous displacement reactivate earthquake crack previous displacement associate recognizable surface topographic feature 
the result study thus indicate careful subsurface investigation construction minimize potential hazard earthquake induce ground crack area 
seismic slope stability analysis the landslide summit ridge area present rare opportunity calibrate exist technique analyze potential slope displacement seismic condition 
the study cole other chapter involve sample material test seismic slope stability analysis two landslide 
cole other conclude slope stability analysis conduct measure material strength laboratory small diameter sample may underestimate actual landslide displacement 
they also find calculated landslide displacement 
highly sensitive predict ground water level within analyzed slope ground motion record use input analysis 
their study show seismic slope stability analysis may make accurate material strength estimate backanalysis previous slope failure

provide significant test exist hazard reduction technique case study improve technique 
area landsliding technique identify slope susceptible failure develop largely past year largely prove correct most slope fail earthquake could accurately characterize sufficiently detailed preearthquake mapping analysis 
postearthquake study however also lead recognition type landslide hazard fully appreciate past include potential particularly large complex landslide along fault trace pervasive ridgetop hillside crack due incipient landslide movement contribution earthquake induced failure coastal erosion 
addition earthquake provide opportunity calibration improvement site specific numeric method use estimate potential earthquake induce slope displacement

with exception ground crack exhibit large displacement result earthquake extension vertical displacement show clear evidence earlier episode movement subsurface 
therefore use appropriate investigative technique include geologic trench prospective site site select alow potential large scale ground crack 
ground crack exhibit small earthquake related displacement commonly necessarily associate subsurface evidence earlier episode movement 
therefore predictive reliability small scale crack low
