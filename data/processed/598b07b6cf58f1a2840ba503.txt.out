different scenario possible continent reach subduction zone trench 
for instance apennines carpathians many study suggest delamination lithospheric mantle continental crust occur leave thin layer crust lithospheric mantle keep subducting

the buoyancy subducting plate important factor process

continent different structure 
thickness composition estimate precise density proﬁle continental crust trivial task since geophysical petrological model give unique answer always agree 
our result show underplating slab break occur even high density lower continental crust consider model oc500layered fig 
for continent even high density crust would increasingly diﬃcult underplating occur 
however dense continental crust easy would subduct thus unlikely break happen 
although go subduction continental lithosphere suggest case capitanio slab break arguably much common behaviour

particular progressive migration mantle wedge away suture zone would likely result shift volcanism well 
furthermore warm continental crust underplating might lead crustal melt therefore affect composition magmatism surface

moreover model assume boundary upper low mantle impermeable whereas nature slab either stagnate penetrate upper low mantle transition fukao obayashi
