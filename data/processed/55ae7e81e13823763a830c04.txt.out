introduction the franciscan complex california contains number tectonostratigraphic terranes characterize general lithologic content deposit age structural style metamorphic grade sandstone petrography 
boundary terranes either clearly define fault diffuse structural transition 
most worker agree franciscan stratum accrete north america consequence late mesozoic middle tertiary interaction subducting oceanic plate jones 
detail however structural history franciscan complex remain poorly understood 
the overall metamorphic history franciscan complex fairly well know bailey blake ernst 
past study also provide information temperature franciscan metamorphism detail 
bachman example estimate minimum depth burial near bragg roughly meter base upon four measurement thermal alteration index 
ray diffraction data demonstrate stratum within central belt reach temperature pressure kilobars cloos 
several measurement vitrinite reflectance also complete diablo range central california bostick garberville scotia fig 
the study area discuss report locate northern coast range california latitude fig 
previous geologic investigation within region include irwin i960 kleist 1974a 1974b gucwa maxwell day evitt pierce kramer bachman orchard 
the three principal tectonostratigraphic terranes define bachman other franciscan central belt upper mesozoic franciscan coastal belt upper cretaceous oligocene yager complex paleocene oligocene fig 
the boundary fold turbidites yager complex old melange central belt mark prominent thrust 
this terrane boundary give several name include garberville thrust underwood coastal belt thrust jones 
recent mapping allow regional differentiation coastal belt yager strata bachman underwood 
because call coastal belt thrust longer contact involve coastal belt rock rename boundary seem appropriate thus new designation eel river fault bachman 
west yager complex separate broadly coeval rock coastal belt diffuse structural zone call coastal belt transition underwood 
this boundary define gradual change structural style coastal belt turbidites display typical melange fabric scaly argillite pinch swell etc 
penetrative pervasive stratum 
disruption absent bed yager complex 
several high angle fault also evident within study area especially vicinity ukiah cloverdale irwin herd pampeyar other mclaughlin nil sen 
these fault probably strike slip nature little detailed mapping complete document fault affect structural relationship within franciscan 
cape mendocino 
map coastal northern california show location study area 
the purpose study document level thermal maturity within franciscan terranes use technique vitrinite reflectance 
all sample obtain surface exposure 
three specific goal identify establish range thermal maturity value franciscan terrane identify surface anomaly gradient value especially relate terrane boundary integrate thermal maturity data exist structural stratigraphic information order reconstruct history burial 
technique vitrinite derive woody tissue vascular plant 
the technique vitrinite reflectance base upon empirical observation reflectance value coal shale increase exponentially burial depth dow bostick 
value probably dependent several parameter maximum temperature important price 
because geothermal gradient sedimentation rate vary space time profile versus depth differ virtually every sedimentary basin 
there several problem inherent technique vitrinite reflectance 
first individual vitrinite particle generally anisotropic reflectance anisotropy increase exponentially increase dow connor 
the effect anisotropy negligible mean value however data report fall threshold 
moreover analysis perform randomly orient particle mean value calculate 
past study demonstrate technique statistically sound effective address anisotropy problem dow connor houseknecht matthew 
second problem mean value dependent upon type organic matter present 
hydrogen rich type organic matter form anaerobic condition yield mean value significantly low obtain oxygen rich type iii kerogens hutton cook newman newman bostick other price barker 
visual evaluation kerogen type underwood together unpublished geochemical analysis show type iii organic matter predominates franciscan shale 
therefore data apparently affect type suppression reflectance 
because resistance vitrinite weather grain recycle old sedimentary stratum 
second cycle particle reset reach equilibrium subsequent burial regime peak temperature exceed early phase burial 
commonly recycle material derive rock unit experience peak temperature higher present host rock 
under circumstance reset occur failure identify recycled population lead calculation mean erroneously high 
instance recycle grain recognize eliminated petrographic examination use morphologic criterion see appendix 
recognition also possible data plot histogram although technique somewhat subjective 
accord convention data eliminate calculation mean

reflectance upper histogram tail separate main body data fig 
other variety disperse organic matter sometimes difficult distinguish true vitrinite although instance morphologic criterion adequate proper identification see appendix 
the reflectance vitrinite also modify recent weathering near ground surface marchioni 
this problem reduce select fresh possible sample outcrop moreover weather grain display oxidation halo crack pit obvious morphologic anomaly 
once identify grain simply remove data population 
also note actual measurement oxidation halo yield low reflectance value similar measurement make unaltered core 
final problem relate relatively low content organic matter many franciscan sample 
organic matter extract concentrated follow method outline appendix 
several case however sample prove virtually barren vitrinite 
unfortunately problem remain unsolved able obtain statistically reliable data roughly sample originally collect 
discuss appendix believe variation mean reflectance geologically significant several technique available model variation thermal maturation 
for example hood other propose time temperature model base upon concept maximum temperature effective heating time amount time give rock unit remain within max 
recent study however challenge validity method especially low level thermal maturation suggate 
second technique term lopatin method waples require detailed reconstruction burial depth versus geologic age usually series stratigraphic horizon 
because many uncertainty relate franciscan burial history lopatin reconstruction seem inappropriate study 
moreover barker price provide convincing evidence equilibration reflectance occur within year additional time little effect reflectance valve 
correlation vitrinite reflectance maximum temperature price allow technique use absolute paleogeothermometer 
noted primary intent study focus relative difference thermal maturity rather absolute value either paleotemperature burial depth 
nevertheless burial depth also calculate selection make past geothermal gradient 
the choice proper temperature gradient problematic 
most measurement present day surface heat flow within study area range hfu hfu cal sec lachenbruch sas 
use standard heat flow equation thermal conductivity cal present day geothermal gradient thus 
change geothermal gradient cenozoic time difficult ass 
however assume subduction accretion model franciscan complex bachman underwood basically correct modern accretionary margin oregon washington aleutian forearc also serve effective analog 
temperature gradient 
histogram show distribution reflectance value two sample franciscan coastal belt 
sample display normal gaussian distribution recycle grain evident 
sample contains particles distinctly high value particle probably recycle therefore removed calculation mean reflectance 
locality range blackwell other mccarthy other 
consequently believe gradient geologically reasonable franciscan especially purpose calculate relative change burial depth 
result coastal belt forty one sample collect franciscan coastal belt contain sufficient vitrinite reflectance measurement appendix

there several spatial trend thermal maturity within coastal belt 
the high value occur east town fort bragg mendocino fig 
three prominent anomaly evident 
contour plot mean show three high discontinuously distribute along trend clearly separate intervene low fig 
there also general pattern increase reflectance east west although trend break along coast immediately south mendocino fig 
there systematic variation thermal maturity south north iso reflectance contour least subparallel structural grain 
consequently variation reflectance appear control structural architecture 
document level thermal maturation consequence structural stratigraphic burial shear heat depths burial coastal belt range meter meter assume surface temperature geothermal gradient

possible however additional heat generate locally friction along fault surface 
the anomaly locate east mendocino particularly suspicious fig 
mean reflectance apparently change distance roughly one kilometer west high mean reflectance decrease 
the maximum variation paleotemperature thus fig 
anomaly due variation burial depth alone approximately meters differential uplift erosion seemingly require 
moreover high value bound side relative low uplift would involve either complex fault geometry diapir rise

the spatial variation thermal maturity within yager complex rather complicate 
south will value tend increase east west fig 
this pattern interrupt immediately southwest willits iso reflectance contour trend east west high angle regional structural grain within yager 
north zone contour sub parallel structural grain will piercy reflectance systematically decrease east west fig 
this trend anomalous level maturation increase stratigraphic section see bachman structural data 
the observed decrease mean east west also document north burial yager section attribute underthrusting along eel river fault leary 
this model favor young neogene section wildcat group thick enough produce observe reflectance value use reasonable geothermal gradient underwood 
the argument apply section piercy willits systematic east west reduction maturity probably due wedge hang wall eel river fault 
obviously pattern establish south will cannot explained manner 
believe additional structural mapping reflectance measurement require region definitive interpretation make 
two isolated anomaly also evident within willits piercy corridor 
the first associate long valley inlier south laytonville mean vitrinite reflectance reach high even impressive anomaly find near leggett mean fig 
frictional heating likely case long valley anomaly sample locality immediately adjacent eel river fault 
similar anomaly document along terrane boundary far north humboldt county underwood 
the locality long valley also lie within maacama fault zone zone quaternary right lateral strike slip movement herd pampeyan mclaughlin nilsen 
the leggett anomaly immediately adjacent map thrust magnitude distance appear unrealistic attribute anomaly simple change burial depth 
the temperature variation accord price method would require differential burial meter 
strike slip faulting may cause anomaly 
perhaps fault sliver contain mature stratum emplace along maacama fault zone 
however seem unlikely temperature magnitude could produce shear heating near surface quaternary strike slip fault 
the leggett anomaly certainly deserve additional attention well define spatial extent genetic relationship fault map within vicinity

these data obviously insufficient characterize entire central belt terrane 
nevertheless demonstrate temperature within terrane least locally depressed 
accord price method reflectance value correspond temperatures the temperature estimate unexpected consider melange matrix locally contain low blueschist facies mineral assemblage temperature stability cloos 
these data tend confirm hypothesis attribute melange genesis tectonic mixing within accretionary prism cowan 
long postulated isotherm significantly depress within accretionary complex underthrusting cold oceanic crust ernst 
moreover circulation pore fluid accretionary wedge probably also act depress temperature von huene lee cloos 
our vitrinite data simply add credence view 
summary estimate paleotemperature within franciscan coastal belt range average temperature temperature estimate yager complex slightly high range average several prominent anomaly evident within terranes 
coastal belt anomaly could due either melange diapir frictional heating along unrecognized fault 
the anomaly within yager complex probably cause shear heating along eel river fault along one several high angle fault present area 
the typical yager trend decrease thermal maturity east west explain wedge hang wall eel river fault high burial depth require yager complex attribute underthrusting along terrane boundary 
although data sparse temperature within central belt melange apparently subdue range data support contention temperature significantly depress genesis blueschist facies melange terranes 
technique sample preparation and data collection the sample preparation technique derive outlined bostick alpern doher dow connor combine advice joseph wood david houseknecht university missouri 
the method suggest literature vary considerably choose technique best suit equipment available 
kerogen concentration approximately grams sample process 
the sample rinse distilled water scrub stiff brush dry prior crushing 
sample crush iron mortar fragment roughly size place polyethylene beaker allow soak overnight hydrochloric acid 
the acid pour distilled water add sample 
silicate remove add hydrofluoric acid 
because harmful effect associate acid work must do fume hood use full protective gear face mask rubber glove etc 
each sample place magnetic stirrer agitate short period 
the sample remain several hour 
end period ensure silicates remove additional add 
warm beaker indicate silica still present must add remove silica overnight immersion may necessary 
follow removal silicate acid acid residue must rinse sample 
either two rinsing procedure follow 
immediately treatment complete sample decant two polyethylene centrifuge tube 
this material centrifuge kerogen settle bottom tube clear liquid pour plastic waste container disposal 
this step repeat sample decant 
then sample rinse distilled water centrifuge discard residual liquid 
this water rinse repeat least four time 
alternatively treatment complete beaker fill brim distilled water the sample allow settle several hour overnight 
the clear liquid pour plastic storage bottle care take pour away kerogen 
the remain sample centrifuge method except two rinse necessary 
the kerogen bottom centrifuge tube scrap aluminum dish dry heat lamp 
finally dry kerogen ground fine powder mortar store plastic vial 
slide preparation slide kerogen concentrate prepare use method similar suggest bask 
small amount hillquist slow curing epoxy component mixed powder kerogen concentrate aluminum dish 
enough kerogen mixed kerogen epoxy 
mixture become viscous retains smooth texture 
this mixture allow set minute 
while epoxy set one side petrographic slide frost use coarse grit thoroughly dried ensure epoxy adhere slide 
also additional batch epoxy without kerogen add prepared set aside 
small drop epoxy place corner slide last step slide cure 
these drop prevent kerogen epoxy pellet pull polish 
follow dry slide two centimeter diameter pellet partially set kerogen epoxy mixture apply center frost slide 
this must cure additional minute room temperature perfectly horizontal surface 
the finish slide place warm tray cure degree celsius additional hour 
the recommended curing temperature epoxy degree celsius find many slide cracked temperature rapid curing 
heating temperature could conceivably alter reflectance value well 
slide polish the first step polish slide cut flat even surface epoxy pellet 
find best accomplished use thin section grind wheel slowly evenly grind pellet thickness 
the result surface polish standard lap use buehler petrothin attachment buehler texmet lap cloth 
the succession grit size use follow micron diamond paste approximately minute micron alumina slurry minute micron alumina slurry minute 
the slide must clean step use ultrasonic cleaner soap quickly dry avoid swell organic matter ruin polish 
end polish sequence epoxy pellet uniform glassy surface vitrinite scratch view high magnification 
the slide must store dessicator least hour prior observation order remove remain moisture 
this dry step important moisture content affect value suggate lowery 
data collection observation reflect light make use 50x oil immersion lens 16x ocular mount leitz ortholux research microscope set reflect light mode 
keithly high voltage power supply hewlettpackard direct current power supply use provide stable power photometer light source respectively 
reflect light direct micron diameter measure spot leitz mpv photometer value read keithly microvolt digital voltmeter 
important properly select vitrinite particle order obtain correct mean value 
the first step distinguish vitrinite material present 
liptinite pollen grain waxy plant material inertinite pre alter plant material resemble vitrinite material likely confuse 
liptinite low reflectance associate vitrinite darker color distinctive morphology 
inertinite usually much reflective associate 
vitrinite often distinctive shape 
however form inertinite closely resemble vitrinite reflectance value vary continuously vitrinite inertinite range 
coal petrography distinguish vitrinite liptinite inertinite straightforward type visible microscope field allow direct comparison reflectance structure 
organic concentrate detrital rock however cannot always accomplish 
especially rock low content organic matter franciscan shale organic particle small widelydispersed across prepared slide 
possible reliably distinguish liptinite inertinite eliminate sample population nevertheless remain population include first cycle vitrinite real mean value calculate prealtered vitrinite weather oxidize recycled mature source terrane type inertinite bostick 
any particle round edge eliminate data likelihood recycling 
addition particle display numerous pit crack miner regard weathered oxidize eliminate data 
the usual method choose particle measurement select least altered low gray particle within assume vitrinite population 
when many particle within microscope field straightforward procedure difficult uncertain widely disperse fragment 
moreover bias towards expect value could cause microscopist favor particle nearest expect value 
prevent possible bias study microscopist leary know location significance sample mean report 
our identification first cycle vitrinite rely upon several characteristic 
examine coal know rank find follow parameter useful select vitrinite within range value encounter study little relief various type inertinite slight strong positive relief high susceptibility scratch inertinite often much resistant scratch somewhat rough look ing surface many fine crack inertinite usually smooth surface distinctive gray color liptinites appear blacker inertinites white even yellowish botanical structure though sometimes see inertinites regard confirm vitrinite selection fell within select population 
sample many vitrinite particle contain pyrite miner easily identify high reflectance brass color 
believe vitrinite alter reflectance measurement vitrinite include data present 
however bostick write communication state vitrinite contain pyrite excellent indicator first cycle least altered vitrinite 
check sample confirm vitrinite containing pyrite fall within first cycle population determine use morphologic criterion 
data reduction interpretation about particle per sample measure assure statistical validity calculation mean 
the data point routinely plot histogram use sample interval case nearly gaussian distribution value evident 
case mean standard deviation value calculate use available data point 
however case distribution distinctly bimodal isolated value much high majority 
such data may represent recycle vitrinite inertinite particle eliminate use morphologic criterion 
accord convention high value include calculation mean reflectance gap least percent one sample interval two population 
systematic error exist data set err high side rather low side 
comparison industry researcher seem arbitrarily eliminate recycled population histogram without adequate explanation empirical justification 
accuracy tfve accuracy vitrinite reflectance data difficult evaluate laboratory statistical technique never standardize nationwide 
one standard practice however confirm value use pyrolysis technique observation thermal alteration pollen grain 
thermal alteration index tai particularly popular method allow degree precision vitrinite reflectance 
complete multiple run select sample analyze within laboratory 
addition sample split submit commercial lab tai evaluate 
the result comparison show appendix the result lab generally within least mean value produce laboratory moreover two commercial lab vary factor 
most mean value slightly higher conservative approach use removal recycle histogram tail 
standard deviation franciscan sample somewhat large expect give documented level thermal maturity 
there probably several reason 
first adopt relatively unbiased criterion optical selection vitrinite particle 
operator selects particles uniform reflectance assume represent primary population small standard deviation naturally result however mean value necessarily incorporate true primary population may error 
shale contain relatively low percentage organic matter commonly produce broad scatter reflectance value turbidite deposit apparently contain great percentage recycle vitrinite detrital accumulation castano spark 
both factor probably affect study 
final factor perhaps important surficial weather increase standard deviation without affect mean value marchioni 
this effect mention study utilize surface sample houseknecht 
matthew would remain insignificant study subsurface sample core well cutting 
conclusion even though several inherent problem involve selection criterion statistical treatment vitrinite reflectance data result reproducible least 
furthermore believe change mean reflectance geologically significant
