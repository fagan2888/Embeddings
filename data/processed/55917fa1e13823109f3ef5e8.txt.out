automatic water stage recorder maintain one well throughout year 
there available automatic record well year 
because limitation finance personnel necessary make many spring measurement date considerably different sed spring 
accordingly measurement cannot strictly compare previous year 
the significant fact regard geologic arid hydrologic condition grand prairie region ere describe briefly water supply paper

the measurement spring show downward trend continue many well pump season

desirable emphasize fact water level observation well grand prairie region show fluctuation foot within day much foot hour fluctuation cause fluctuation atmospheric pressure 
the water level tend atmospheric pressure increase rise atmospheric pressure decrease 
the great differ ences due passage area high low pressure condition produce fair stormy weather respectively
