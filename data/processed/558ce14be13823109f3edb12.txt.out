bolli saunders call attention inclusion recent fresh water thecamoebina specie description fossil recent foraminifer assemblage 
specie foraminifer genus proteonina saccammina lagunculina millettella well represent synonomy 
cit give specimen thecamoebina erroneously describe foraminifera 
bolli saunders give deflandre simplify classification rhizopoda test group thecamoebina practically fresh water form group foraminifera practically marine brackish water form 
use classification would essential establish definitely fresh water origin specimen assign genus thecamoebina 
bolli saunders state fossil thecamoebina record rock old middle eocene though almost certain group far ancient origin 
the writer consider presence fossil thecamoebina either recent fossil foraminifer assemblage unlikely may ignore 
however author refer specie proteonina leptodermella millettella describe cushman twiggs clay eocene georgia specimens proteonina urnulina millettella leptodermella describe cushman cahill miocene coastal plain eastern united state thecamoebina genus dijflugia centropyxis cyclopyxis centropyxis centropyxis pontigulasia 
bolli saunders justify change assignment suggesting form recent specimen thecamoebina associate true foraminifer faunal assemblage agency stream locate near outcrop contain eocene miocene fauna
