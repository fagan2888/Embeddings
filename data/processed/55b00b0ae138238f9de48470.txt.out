relative importance ground water and surface water supply oil shale development piceance basin colorado william alley abstract vast deposit oil shale contain piceance basin northwestern colorado 
potential source water development resource include colorado white river stream within piceance basin oil shale aquifer system various deep aquifer underlie piceance basin 
this paper investigate relative importance value information source water 
the analysis perform simulating sensitivity require active storage capacity vmax hypothetical reservoir white river different assumption water demand contribution various source water 
both steady state transient analysis perform 
steady state analysis oil shale industry assume equilibrium constant demand water 
this analysis indicate considerable uncertainty exist several important hydrologic variable relate oil shale development 
factor explore one important one affect estimate vmax supply water available oil shale aquifer 
for example current estimate average annual natural recharge oil shale aquifer approximately equal amount water require oil shale industry produce barrel oil per day require barrel water per barrel shale oil produce because oil shale aquifer system contain large amount ground water least partially dewatered part oil shale mining water could important source water shale oil production 
however many factor contribute large uncertainty amount ground water available 
among source uncertainty interaction surface water ground water piceance basin amount available water storage oil shale aquifer exist water right priority ownership piceance basin 
other factor estimate vmax find sensitive supply water available colorado river requirement downstream release white river 
compare uncertainty factor water supply estimate show insensitive uncertainty evaporation estimate 
the sensitivity vmax use water four main stream piceance basin parachute roan piceance yellow creek less sensitivity factor evaporation 
although combine mean annual flow piceance yellow creek less mean annual flow 
either parachute roan creeks sensitivity vmax use piceance yellow creek meet part water demand great sensitivity use parachute roan creek 
the apparent reason parachute roan creeks strongly affected drought piceance yellow creek 
because form part stream aquifer system oil shale aquifer presently use extensively irrigation piceance yellow creek may supplement water rather use source water shale oil production 
the transient analysis perform use hypothetical reservoir white river steady state analysis 
however synthetic streamflow model use generate five hundred equally likely year period monthly inflow reservoir 
analysis oil shale industry assume expand million barrel oil per day year time period resultant increase water demand mine dewatering 
during year period mine water assume available increase rate average one half current estimate natural recharge rate piceance basin 
use mine water supply part water demand result reduction surface storage requirement vmax order thousand acre many streamflow sequence 
use water auxiliary well represent standby source water event short term shortage surface water supply also large effect estimate vmax 
for example vmax reduce order thousand acre additional water available auxiliary well pump capacity equal estimate natural recharge rate 
these well pump average rate less percent capacity streamflow sequence 
the timing reservoir development also find sensitive assumption ground water use 
for example early requirement reservoir capacity thousand acre delayed year streamflow sequence mine water use meet part water demand 
further delay need reservoir development could realize ground water auxiliary well available

ancillary us associate oil shale development would include domestic use also many water demand would accompany increase population 
these would include water require public service commercial establishment accompany population increase 
whereas water use estimate report oil shale plant mine assume represent consumptive use report ancillary purpose usually represent intake water 
only fraction intake water consumptively use remainder return local hydro ogic system

the city grand junction colorado reportedly provide gallon per day per caput municipal domestic us miller write commun 
the estimate account large scale growth industry power generation area require considerable amount water 
summary considerable uncertainty exist industrial ancillary water requirement oil shale industry 
industrial water requirement likely great ancillary water requirement 
for example assume million barrel per day oil shale industry ancillary water use gallon per day per caput percent consumptively use total population increase people per barrel per day shale oil production 
annual consumptive use water ancillary us would acre whereas might range acre industrial us 
total withdrawal ancillary us would acre

deep ground water very little known water bearing property mesozoic paleozoic rock underlie picaance basin rock may contain sizeable amount usable water shale oil production

transient analysis the steady state analysis assume demand water amount ground water pump constant year year 
however actual development oil shale industry result time vary demand water time vary dewataring rate 
water management issue require transient analysis investigation include cyclic storage effect ground water use time reservoir development 
cyclic storage define lettenmaier surge longterm management surface subsurface storage improve system operate performance resistance drought 
the concept arise typical surface water reservoir storage volumes much small compare abstraction ground water storage volume

hence judicious long term management ground water supply integrate short term management surface water supply increase reliance ground water period drought ideally reversal situation period excess dewatering surface runoff artificial recharge portion excess water

during year sequence shale oil production assume increase linearly million barrel oil per day year 
this approximately baseline rate report water resource council 
they estimate shale oil production use water white river barrel per day barrel per day year 
case water resource council estimate rate expansion shale oil production illustrative purpose intend characterize likely intend scenario 
previous example assume combined industrial ancillary demand water three barrel water barrel oil produce 
thus end year period water demand shale oil production assume acre 
previously discuss mine dewatering estimate highly variable 
unlikely million barrel per day oil shale industry water available mine dewatering excess water use replace surface water depletion due ground water pump would exceed 
oewatering rate would probably increase year period production increase 
this increase dewatering rate might estimate occur linear rate 
however likely dewatering rate per unit shale oil produce decrease production increase dewatering operation various mine begin decrease potentiometric head mine

both scenario result pump thousand acre water year time span average rate one half estimate present annual natural recharge piceance basin 
mine dewatering option exceeds option first year end year period dewatering rate option percent rate option 
the linear rate option might represent scenario whereby part mine water recharge later use water demand great 
projection water demand equation illustrative purpose intend likely scenario
