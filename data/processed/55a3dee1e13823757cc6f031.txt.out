sample paleomagnetic study 
the result sit sample within pluton show two type remanence behavior appear fairly consistent rock composition 
the leucocratic rock site tend yield single component magnetization generally low coercivities block temperature relative unit consider represent recent viscous overprint 
the mesocratic melanocratic rock show single multicomponent magnetization latter give characteristic direction isolate remagnetization plane analysis 
three site consider reliable yield paleomagnetic pole infer early devonian age may reflect southward displacement stable north america 
one large site sample give remagnetized pole position infer carboniferous age consistent pole north america perhaps indicate piedmont may become part north american plate time 
introduction the southern appalachian orogen comprises thick sequence extensively deform rock reflect prolonged history tectonic activity 
recent model develop describe activity necessarily complex base part premise portion orogen originate elsewhere 
paleomagnetic data eastern new england coastal maritime province craton north america imply sinistral strike slip movement two region time period middle devonian late carboniferous 
this lead speculation whether southern appalachian piedmont involve similar displacement 
paleomagnetic study southern appalachian piedmont either direct toward single rock unit encompass number unit vary widely rock type location assign age 
the paleomagnetic pole calculate unit date carboniferous generally correspond pole similar age north american craton whereas paleomagnetic result older rock part prove difficult interpret 
rao van der voo however isolate inferred late ordovician magnetization single pluton appalachian piedmont delaware use remagnetization circle analysis suggest piedmont far south north america time 
this study undertaken provide paleomagnetic result could contribute understand early middle paleozoic tectonic development southern appalachian 
with reliable paleomagnetic data allochthonous portion southern appalachian orogen could distinguish limit place point origin 
avoid potential problem due remagnetization postemplacement tilt difficult assess paleomagnetic result single pluton seven pluton approximately late silurian early devonian age sample piedmont north south carolina 
although unit include paleomagnetic study broader scope paleomagnetic result inconclusive 
difficulty encounter study well due mostly secondary magnetic overprinting result consider reliable support allochthonous origin southern appalachian piedmont

all sample subject either progressive thermal alternate field demagnetization average step per specimen 
almost half sample thermally demagnetize employ shield non induct wound electrical furnace 
demagnetization do commercial single axis demagnetizer measurement magnetization make digital spinner magnetometer also commercial design 
demagnetization data specimen plot use orthogonal vector diagram equal area plot 
component search demagnetization data make use least square method base principal component analysis develop kirschvink 
method line plane fit endpoint successive magnetization vector three dimensional space 
collinear point usually suggest removal single magnetic vector component demagnetization whereas coplanar indicate simultaneous removal two magnetic vector component differ ratio 
the intersection two demagnetization plane within single speciman use define intermediate magnetic vector component hoffman day direction 
should origin fall within line plane error limit include data point represent theoretical final demagmetization value anchor fit origin imply component remove fit one remain rock specimen 
minimum three point need check collinear four point coplanar estimate precision fit give kirschvink method maximum angular deviation

thermal demagnetization perform rock unit mostly yield characteristic direction consistent isolate treatment 
both thermal demagnetization high indicate magnetic carrier rock unit primarily magnetite

two type remanence behavior observe 
the first characterize single component magnetization identify linear demagnetization trend vector diagram fig

demagnetization line also find sample site yield demagnetization plane similar direction plane converge

the site mean calculate former case lo2 numerous line direction latter mci co3 br3 converge plane consider show accurately partially overprint characteristic direction table

discussion the paleomagnetic result site characterize single component magnetization show dominate direction present earth field pef region southern appalachian piedmont fig 
because remanent magnetization usually associate generally low coercivities block temperature infer recent viscous origin 
the shallow inclination northeasterly declination two site granite sa2 ya1 could reflect magnetic anisotropy coincident regional foliation inherent pre metamorphic rock 
apart noticeable trend within pef overprint site mean direction toward steep downward inclination easterly declination general direction mci site mean 
the diorite yield mean direction converge demagnetization plane singularly southeasterly declination shallow downward inclination 
paleomagnetic pole calculate direction roughly similar pole determine north american craton range age early devonian late carboniferous table 
late carboniferous age characteristic magnetization diorite prefer would correspond date aplite dike cut diorite 
the emplacement dike part last major episode igneous intrusion southern piedmont 
inferred episode intrusion responsible remagnetization least diorite possibly significant effect many rock piedmont evidenced part reset biotite age granite south carolina 
perhaps relicts remagnetization contribute steeper inclination observe singlecomponent pef overprint rock 
the characteristic magnetization remain site co3 lo2 br3 determine part converge demagnetization plane give paleomagnetic pole position displace south reported north america devonian table consider reliable table 
because pole calculate site correspond north american apparent polar wander path since devonian characteristic magnetic direction rock could acquire initial crystallization cool southern appalachian piedmont part north america locate approximately south perhaps gondwana affinity 
this albeit tenuous assertion support general equivalence site direction presence site mean normal reversed polarity 
also southward displacement suggest devonian paleomagnetic pole intermediate inferred northern piedmont ordovician presume suture piedmont north america carboniferous 
alternative explanation southward displacement piedmont would post magnetization southward tilt site 
mildly deform triassic sediment undisturbed cretaceous stratum coastal plain indicate large southward tilt piedmont would predate triassic 
and furthermore explanation require large portion southern piedmont show uniform southward tilt inconsistent northeast southwest structural trend region 
summary study demonstrate difficulty encounter conduct paleomagnetic investigation middle paleozoic rock complex area southern appalachian piedmont
