many term currently use describe salt flat example glennie seem considerable overlap mean 
paper term sabkhah also spell sabkha make popular kinsman use describe salt flat near coast united arab emirates former trucial state qatar 
however follow suggestion ill taylor paper use term sabkhah restrict coastal area old term playa use describe salt flat form interior topographic depression irrespective whether hydrologic system associate salt flat open close

these investigation recent deposit prompt reexamination many ancient evaporite deposit evidence formation sabkhah environment 
the hydrologic system underlying coastal sabkhahs united arab emirates contains continental derive marine derived water patterson kinsman

kinsman first suggest continental sabkhahs equilibrium deflation sedimentation surface level capillary fringe mark base level wind deflation

therefore raise lower water table accompany either accretion deflation

discussion from february february geophysical service company field camp name fig 
visit three brine sample collect 
the camp locate playa surface west artesian water well ramallah fig 
the playa cover eolian sand thick crust compose sand cement halite gypsum 
this type crust common playas within radius camp 
although consolidated sediment find playa camp locate limestone expose playas within radius camp 
accord geologic map elberg other limestone probably part damrnam formation 
playas dammam formation partly cover eolian sand centimeter deep whereas other dammam formation find depth almost the playas border north south side west trend chain sand dune 
these dune chain connect small low dune whose direction movement approximately parallel long ax dune chain playas 
small low dune separate playas form adjacent dune chain 
least small sand dune mobile 
two locality either near playa surface former position sand dune indicate preservation cement lower edge windward slope dune 
ray analysis indicate cement material predominejjtely halite subordinate amount gypsum calcite possibly sylvite 
indication position major dune chain shift observed 
addition three hole reach water table several hole dig playas attempt collect sample ground water 
some hole reach ground water dug depth range almost 
sediment remove bottom hole appear slightly moist rather excavate large pit unknown depth digging terminate locality 
playas dig hole terminate hard dense limestone layer dammam formation encounter surface layer eolian sand could penetrate 
the chemistry two brine sample collect within krn radius camp may strongly affect man activity area fig 
sample site e016 playa less diameter less ramallah 
gypsum layer thick find different depth playa surface 
the ground water surface sample locality depth 
because ramallah within e016 possible water flow ramallah raise water table sample site affect chemistry water sample contaminate near surface ground water 
sample site e020 fig 
table northwest ramallah 
sample site bulldozer excavate pit deep provide sand make drilling platform well ramallah 
the sand bottom pit well cement gypsurn 
when hole dug depth ground water begin seep 
after approximately minute water hole rise level bottom bulldozer excavation playa surface 
decrease distance ground water surface sediment air interface bulldozer excavation may cause increase rate evaporation ground water excavation 
increase evaporation rate would explain relatively large amount interstitial gypsum site high solute concentration sample table 
sample site e021 northeast camp playa west water well ramallah fig 
edge sand dune chain form playa northern border 
three site sample one probably least affected man activity water sample probably fairly representative ground water chemistry water table table 
after pit sample locality excavate depth ground water observe seep bottom pit 
approximately minute excavation ceased water level pit rise playa surface 
although scatter authigenic gypsum fragment sand playa surface sand cement degree find hole dug sample site e020 
the common authigenic evaporite mineral find playa surface gypsum anhydrite halite 
gypsum crystal fragment approximately long find playa surface several sample site 
nodular anhydrite also believe widely distribute playa surface dry nodule anhydrite find several area bulldozer pile sediment excavate playas 
nodular anhydrite also find situ moist sand hole terminate phreatic zone 
gypsum anhydrite playas sample area either disseminate stringer eolian sand however 
form layer describe sabkhahs united arab emirates coast butler 
base study almost pit dig coastal sabkhahs united arab emirates patterson suggest maximum depth ground water surface sabkhah surface area 
place within radius camp depth groundwater surface playa surface appear crn 
other sample site e016 groundwater surface possibly raise proximity outflow well ramallah hole dig water table indicate surface phreatic zone least playa surface 
one hole dug bottom bulldozer excavate pit reach ground water depth almost playa surface 
maximum depth ground water surface playa sabkhah surface deflational equilibrium depend height capillary fringe extend phreatic zone 
this dependence function several know factor 
composition fluid sediment well sediment size capillary radius permeability help determine far capillary fringe extend phreatic zone 
from patterson description sediment brine composition unite arab emirate probable limited range sediment brine composition find sampled area around camp within range sediment brine composition describe patterson 
limit describe patterson observational rather theoretical limit may apply area united arab emirate coast 
alternate explanation water table camp area deep playa surface area may longer deflational equilibrium 
current playa surface may preserve early possibly humid time water table high 
the small area sample limited number sample collect prevent definite conclusion concern significance cause great depth groundwater surface observe near camp compare depth tothe ground water surface united arab emirates coast 
conclusion within loo area contains water well ramallah three brine sample collect arid hole dug 
extrapolation interpretation observation make area uruq taridahurnm samim area extent make great caution 
before definite 
conclusion concern area reach many sample need collect much large area investigate 
although several interesting question concern basic geology could answer area none immediate economic interest 
reconnaissance investigation near camp suggest chemistry ground water fairly typical area contain gypsum 
even potential economic element potassium present unusually high concentration grind water remoteness area difficulty transportation would result high production cost 
these condition probably make recovery evaporite raw material uneconomic material usually must produce large volume low cost 
condition presently make economic recovery evaporites unlikely however change future significant quantity evaporites brine uruq taridah umm samirn area locate evaluate report 
emphasize small fraction total area contain playas described report extremely large evaporative environment virtually unexplored evaporite mineral brine 
other evaporative environment previously describe literature may reliable guide type authigenic mineral chemistry brine area study unique geologic environment warrant
