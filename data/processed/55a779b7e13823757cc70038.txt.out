summary information potential offshore sand borrow area 
introduction coastal erosion land loss widespread serious problem throughout united state affect part coastal state 
erosion due primarily natural long term process occasionally man make influence also cause erosion aggravate exist erosion condition 
the factor responsible coastal erosion rise relative sea level due combination world wide rise ocean elevation subsidence coastal land area action wave current storm surge associate coastal storm reduction supply sand reach coast 
the headland coast virginia extend cape henry south sandbridge beach typical middle atlantic coastal compartment 
over past century sea level rise storm diminish littoral sand volume result net erosion virginia coast 
generally rate shoreline recession decrease sandbridge beach north cape henry evert other 
the effect erosion especially critical along virginia beach due area urban character 
virginia beach one large popular recreation beach available public 
beach nourishment one several engineering method use mitigate coastal erosion provide buff sea area landward beach 
sand fill place mechanical hydraulic mean native beach elevate berm dune area extend beach seaward 
more beach nourishment project complete united state since early 1950s williams 
beach nourishment increase appeal hard coastal engineering method 
breakwater groin closely duplicate natural coastal process 
like engineering solution beach nourishment temporary finite life however unlike hard method leave unsafe unsightly legacy fill erode 
beach nourishment involve artificially add sand diminish littoral sediment budget wave current remobilize sand beach shorface system attain dynamic equilibrium coastal process 
basic requirement however beach nourishment availability large volume sand suitable fill 
the sand must meet fairly exact criterion composition grain size diameter sort 
sand fill must also available quantity sufficient initial placement periodic replacement cost exceed project budget environment harm dredge 
over past several year corps engineer norfolk district carry study assess nature magnitude erosion along virginia beach coast 
they also investigate plan improve deepen atlantic ocean navigation channel main shipping route chesapeake bay commercial harbor norfolk baltimore 
one aspect 
channel deepen project involve deepen widen exist channel 
another critical aspect proper disposal dredge sediment 
plan dredge atlantic ocean channel finish dimension foot wide foot deep produce approximately million cubic yard sediment 
because large volume clean sand need emplacement virginia beach coast corp evaluate much dredge material might suitable fill beach nouishment 
since corp engineer obtain vibracore sample maximum core recovery foot study area virginia beach see fig

this information basis identify recommend area proximal study area additional survey data detail core coverage might use locate additional sand body
