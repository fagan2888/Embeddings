mission success corollary astronaut safety first consideration engineering physical property investigation 
engineering property bear strength traffic think important directly relate ability early apollo lunar excursion module land safely lunar surface ability astronaut safely carry assign mission ability ascent stage lunar excursion module leave surface 
the physical property measurement thus divide engineering property

physical property control surface bearing strength general traffic lunar surface material receive high priority since property prime importance mission success 
engineering property shear strength creep cohesion compress strength tensile strength mohr envelope porosity bulk density particle size distribution shape composition help determine lunar surface material allow early apollo spacecraft land safely remain safe attitude throughout lunar mission 
these engineering property also largely control astronaut traffic safety conduct mission lunar surface

several empirical theoretical relationship study relate parameter observe physical property 
two important relationship 
the situ bulk density dry granular fracture material determine compression wave velocity rms error per 
the calculated shear modulus young modulus granular fractured material estimate shear wave velocity without consideration parameter indicate elastic theory 
these calculate modulus compare measure situ modulus 
situ mechanical property measurement include bear strength shear strength penetration resistance bulk density moisture content 
laboratory measurement include confine unconfined compress strength tensile strength bulk density grain density porosity permeability chemical analyse compression wave celocity shear wave velocity 
area concentration geologic physical property investigation geologic personnel complete surface borehole petrography remain unfinished site respon sible physical property measurement 
laboratory physical property investigation continue past year small scale since site data complete 
the new measurement make exist core sample scleroscope hardness 
significant part project effort fiscal year spend measure situ mechanical property 
this investigation include measurement bearing capacity shear strength bulk density moisture content penetration resistance 
situ bulk density measure surface fine grain site millicurie gamma ray backscattering device 
the present gamma ray backscatter depth penetration inch 
since many lunar analog site consist loosely packed angular block rock whose median size great inch instrument applicable measurement area 
bulk density blocky site measure excavate know weight sample large pit whose volume calculate 
since nuclear density measure device penetration depth foot exist shelf situ project construct calibrate use 
probe measure situ bulk density two drill hole 
this probe use gamma absorption technique rather gamma backscatter method calibration do sit bulk density know excavation technique 
this instrument allow operator make large number density measurement site limited amount time 
geophysical investigation field work limited rework minor extension area already investigate demanded future data analysis
