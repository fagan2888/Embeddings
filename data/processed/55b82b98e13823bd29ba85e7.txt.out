general remark 
previously exist molluscan fauna tlie whole area occupy laramio water certain horizon unbroken succession stratum abrupt disappearance distinctively marine form equally abrupt accession brackish water fresh water form continue whole laramie group

true conformity wasatch upon laramie place distinctly recognize major powell other deny existence conformity wherever later stratum discover rest upon laramie group limit indicate note find free fossil form reasonably refer even slightly saline habitat laramie strata contain many brackish water form throughout vertical range

general remakks 
observed character none stratum either laramie wasatch suggest propriety separate either formation distinct group even subordinate division 
that observe nothing character stratum suggest presence region puerco group cope 
have receive professor cope small collection fresh water land shell obtain typical puerco stratum near town nacimiento mex figure plate special search make like form utah stratum refer exception somewhat satisfactory identification puerco unio rectoidcs wasatch stratum near town wale search without material success 
the probability low portion satch series part utah represent puerco group cope know range inolluscan specie laramie wasatch group actual identification specie alone wasatch puerco would serve fix puerco horizon utah region precision 
that facts present know seem plainly indicate puerco fossil publish professor cope indicate distinct epoch history north american vertebrate life neither stratigraphy remain inolluscan life far know give corresponding indication either physical faunal change 
for present therefore hesitate recognize puerco epoch indicate vertebrate fauna professor cope publish able recognize existence distinct group strata represent epoch region examine admit record puerco epoch make history vertebrate life aqueous invertebrate life except locally stratigraphical series 
the specie find pas laramie wasatch figure describe together other followingpages bulletin 
such perpetuation specific form gillbearing mollusk seem make necessary infer unbroken continuity aqueous habitat also continuous sedimentation laramie wasatch group 
the condition strata part utah recently examine also favor inference continuity sedimentation 
the area within blend laramie wasatch take place although large evidently much small blend marine cretaceous stratum fauna laramie observe 
the stratum indicate intimate relation laramie wasatch much disturb district difficulty trace succession largely increase presence surface debris vegetation uppn mountain slope 
still succession 
laramie mollusc and feesh water eocene 
trace good degree satisfaction canon upon eastern face wasatch eange emery san pete county utah 
begin bluish marl colorado group castle valley trace successive stratum without break think fox hill laramie group wasatch group 
addition well know intimate relation three group eocene fresh water deposit namely wasatch green eiver bridger especially green eiver basin north uinta mountain 
that say certain specie mollusk range three group everywhere conformable evident sedimentation continuous whole series 
seem conclusive proof complete unbroken stratigraphical series western region extend middle cretaceous top eocene aggregate nearly quite two mile thickness 
remarkable fact connect production great series sedimentation evidently materially interrupt least large part area within deposit find aqueous life change first purely marine character alternate brackish fresh water finally purely fresh water character water series stratum deposit first marine alternate brackish fresh finally wholly fresh 
this course imply occurrence great physical change upon north american continent cretaceous eocene period however interrupt sedimentation large part interior 
the inability geologists fix upon definite plane demarkation shall separate uppermost marine cretaceous stratum laramie group refer well know 
also know similar state thing really obtain within large part territory utah regard stratum laramie wasatch group strange stratum upon confines group contain identical fauna sbould sometimes refer one sometimes group fauna recognize identical 
far abrupt faunal break laramie wasatch group formerly suppose known faunal relation two group intimate laramie marine cretaceous specie yet know pass latter laramie 
the fact survival wasatch epoch several freshwater molluscan specie hitherto regard belonging exclusively laramie naturally lead inquire whether tbe upper portion laramie series upper missouri eiver region elsewhere may properly refer wasatch 
general remark 
apply rule determination upper limit laramie group designate previous page appear probable least upper portion series stratum expose vicinity fort union near mouth yellowstone eiver refer wasatch group 
that low portion series know fort union bed belong laramie group cannot doubt presence characteristic dinosaurian vertebrate remain evidently break series stratum separate two formation 
upper part series however fresh water molluscan form find except one specie corbuld understood come comparatively low horizon 
moreover several specie mollusk find fort union series laramie stratum 
also find wasatch stratum utah 
this suggestion intimate relation laramie upper missouri eiver region fresh water eocene series apparently support discovery fresh water bed top sentinel butte region 
these bed connect laramie stratum beneath direct continuity suggest probably represent green eiver group before close remark think desirable state concisely ground conclusion stratum western portion national domain form one uninterrupted series low est marine cretaceous formation top bridger group uppermost fresh water eocene series inclusive 
these reason fall two separate category one base upon observed stratigraphical condition upon character distribution fossil content respective group stratum 
the stratigraphical condition indicate continuous sedimentation one group formation next succeed one great series first conformity second absence abrupt change character composition material deposit 
that although numerous instance unconformity within vertical range great series question especially distinctively marine cretaceous stratum unconformity case involve whole formation series 
word unconformity two formation two portion formation apparent one locality perfect conformity find locality 
the great complete unconformity great series hitherto understood exist laramie wasatch group know even horizon perfect conformity within great area include large part territory utah 
this area doubtless 
americaa journal science third series vol 
laramie molluscan and fresh water eocene 
materially reduce strata much displace erode 
the paleontological evidence unbroken continuity series formation question consist mainly know passage cer 
tain specie fossils one formation next 
that species exist estuary marine water cretaceous formation deposit survived brackish water laramie sea probable yet demonstrate specific identification fossil laramie stratum 
that certain specie molluscan fossil range three purely fresh water eocene group long know also know similar range considerable number fresh water specie laramie period coexist brackish water form wasatch group 
this demonstrate faunal continuity series base laramie top bridger group 
the passage fresh water specie one group another understood indicate must continuity congenial habitat one epoch 
habitat continuously lacustrine way think possible fresh water specie question uld survive escape fluviatile water original lacustrine habitat return similar one subsequently establish ground 
the character deposit fossils find indicate sedimentation continuous laramie wasatch aqueous habitat therefore continuous one epoch 
the survival latter epoch certain specie flourish former one show habitat continuously congenial one 
this conclusion course implies individual survive specie whose remains find upper formation direct lineal descendant low 
there appear two alternative conclusion first specie incorrectly identify second reintroduce become extinct 
light modern zoology latter proposition think demand serious consideration 
former say specific determination case make much confidence accuracy may reasonably attend work kind 
connection statement ground upon base opinion advance forego page proper make remark upon estimate value fossils fresh water origin geological determination 
fossil mollusca principal form characterize fresh water deposit alone refer 
the differentiation mollusca generic family ordinal group diversification specific form among group immensely great marine water 
general remark 
water much less open marine lacustrine water minimum differentiation find 
the large collection fossil mollusca make different part world indicate slight tendency differentiation among fresh water mollusca always obtain past geological time also type establish persist long series geological period 
therefore become know fossil fresh water origin little value compare marine origin index true geological age stratum containing 
consequence real value fresh water fossil aid study strati graphical geology underestimate 
while admit fresh avater form little value determine geological age stratum really great importance study local even continental geology fossil 
indeed would quite impracticable ascertain whether water formation deposit marine brackish fresh except character contain fossil 
fresh water formation considerable extent produce upon continental area consequently record phase continental history marine formation give indication 
western north america fresh water deposit rival extent thickness great marine formation would impossible arrive knowledge attain except study fossil 
each great lacustrine formation distinguish fauna uniform character great area quite remarkable 
large area fresh water seas deposit form uniform condition exist geographical distribution specie nearly quite great average marine mollusca 
for example specie laramie group find point thousand mile apart fresh water eocene group molluscan fauna practically identical point much mile apart 
view indicate estimate value fossils freshwater origin study geology great continental area hesitate use confidence foregoing discussion
