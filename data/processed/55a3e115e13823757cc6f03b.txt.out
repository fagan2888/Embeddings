geologic unit and their water bearing property the geologic unit crop vandenberg air force base vicinity show figure group two category consolidate rock unconsolidated deposit 
the consolidated rock consist igneous metamorphic sedimentary rock pre tertiary tertiary age 
these rock contain small quantity ground water 
the unconsolidated deposit consist careaga sand pliocene age paso robles formation pliocene pleistocene 
age orcutt sand terrace deposit pleistocene age alluvium landslides windblown sand recent age 
these unconsolidated sedimentary deposit contain usable ground water present area 
consolidated rock igneous metamorphic rock the old consolidated rock igneous metamorphic rock franciscan formation jurassic cretaceous age igneous metamorphic rock probable tertiary age 
these rock expose near point sal southern extremity base underlie young formation generally consider source ground water 
however small quantity grind water may present fracture deeply weather zone 
sedimentary rock consolidate sedimentary rock pre tertiary tertiary age expose much vandenberg air force base sudden estate property 
the sedimentary rock consist conglomerate sandstone siltstone mudstone shale diatomite limestone 
they yield small moderate quantity grind water fracture 
tejon formation matili sandstone member kerr schenck 
this unit eocene age crop santa ynez mountain near southern boundary base 
here foot thick consist white medium sandstone conglomerate 
area sandstone yield small quantity water spring well 
cozy dell shale member kerr schenck 
this unit eocene age consist gray brown marine shale interbedded thin bed sandstone 
the shale expose southern part base 
probably contain usable quantity grind water vaquero sandstone the vaquero sandstone miocene age expose western part santa ynez mountain near tranquillon mountain 
here formation consist foot brown coarse medium marine sandstone conglomerate 
the formation also penetrate depths foot oil well drill near point arguello evenson 
several spring discharge vaquero sandstone indicate may yield moderate quantity water well 
tranquillon volcanics dibble the tranquillon volcanics dibble miocene age expose tranquillon mountain surround area 
this formation much foot thick compose rhyolite rhyolitic agglomerate tuff 
fracture within formation yield small quantity water spring 
unconsolidated deposit careaga sand the careaga sand fine medium marine sand pliocene age 
loosely consolidated contains silt abundance well rounded pebble upper part formation 
the main outcrop occur north purisima hill foot thick 
though careaga sand yield water well well perforate fine sand silt tend enter well perforation 
properly construct well however probably could eliminate problem yield sufficient quantity water meet need 
paso roble formation the paso robles formation pliocene pleistocene 
age expose near east boundary base san antonio valley 
the formation area foot thick compose loosely consolidated bed gravel sand silt clay occasional bed fresh water limestone low part formation 
the sand usually crossbedded poorly sort include stringer coarse sand gravel 
the formation low permeability yield water well readily alluvium 
nevertheless major source ground water saturate zone sufficient thickness penetrate 
orcutt sand the orcutt sand pleistocene age consist gravel sand lenses silt clay 
this formation principally continental origin contains marine bed 
maximum thickness foot near santa ynez river 
the sand expose much base rest unconformably paso roble older formation 
because orcutt sand moderately porous contains large quantity water strata zone saturation 
however clay silt lens within formation restrict ground water movement thus well perforated formation may yield moderate quantity water 
terrace deposit terrace deposit pleistocene age deposit marine stream terrace expose base along coastal part sudden estate land 
these deposit compose moderately permeable crossbedded gravel sand silt clay maximum thickness probably exceed foot 
most terrace deposit zone saturation source ground water 
alluvium most valley tributary canyon underlie alluvium recent age 
the alluvium range thickness foot make gravel sand silt clay 
area alluvium yield water freely well one main water bearing deposit 
san antonio valley alluvium average foot thickness low two third saturate throughout valley 
the alluvium completely saturate area ground water discharge barka slough 
log test well 35w 10j1 15e3 16e1 indicate alluvium western end san antonio valley contains much clay 
thus well construct part valley probably yield less water well tap alluvium near barka slough 
the alluvium lompoc plain productive source water area 
near vandenberg air force base alluvium foot thick contains upper low member wilson 
the upper member consist clay silt sand lower member consist cobble gravel sand 
the low member foot thick main water bear zone 
the static water level range foot land surface bed clay upper member range foot thickness tend retard downward movement ground water 
windblown sand windblown sand recent age extend inland coast cover part lompoc terrace burton mesa san antonio terrace coastal area north point sal 
the windblown sand extensive san antonio terrace burton mesa form dune three different type young mature old 
the young dune migrate support little vegetation mature dune usually anchor vegetation well preserve 
the old dune also anchor vegetation lose distinctive shape 
the sand maximum thickness foot part lie zone saturation 
thus small perched water body within sand could yield water well 
landslide deposit landslide earthflow debris recent age common point sal area mountainous region southern end base 
these deposit compose rock debris overlies consolidate formation 
seeps spring sometimes occur along low edge landslide debris permeable underlying formation 
development spring might yield enough water meet limited domestic need area
