highway damage related fault road failure associate fault report number south dakota highway include along old new highway crandell hammerquist hoskins state highway 
for instance early crandell noted several highway failure consist swell sags inch much foot distance along axis highway 
summarize crandell idea fault bed surface dip toward road grade provide zone permeability otherwise impermeable pierre shale 
thus failure probably related accumulation excessive amount moisture material underlie highway material become plastic cause failure road surface traffic 
under traffic implies highway deformation result compaction plastic material 
hammerquist hoskins believe differential uplift create faster swell clay fault gouge surround shale cause severe bump along highway 
this mean 
gouge derive grind bedrock fault mechanical disaggregated material surface area clay material swell rapidly great volume intact shale rock 
the swell clay compact less surface area within intact shale rock cannot react upon exposure water way gouge 
for example construction portion highway fracture open due load removal rebound allow increased amount water flow underlie fault zone 
this turn swell thick gouge much 
dilation fracture also allow cyclic wet dry break gouge finer grain thus make gouge susceptible rapid swell surround shale hammerquist hoskins 
the intact shale either side fault zone however break much wet dry cycle therefore remain less fine grain gouge 
contrast amount water find near fault present surround shale crude infiltration test show situ permeability much time great fractured shale near fault sic away relatively unfractured otherwise similar material hammerquist hoskins 
hammerquist hoskins speculate without cite present ray clay mineralogy data support highswelling clay content shale gouge gouge montmorillonite illite composition

wet gouge swell pressure much ton describe grim 
they conclude nine inch concrete pavement plus foot base course easily lift swell soil 
for study two site site fig

the highway pavement adjacent ground nearby fence post displace 
the fault cause deformation average apparent dip strike show reverse separation 
because fault plane irregular surface apparent dip determine four trench 
this do graphically plot point fault enter trench floor point fault intercept top trench 
then angle top trench line connect top bottom fault represent apparent dip measure 
the result measurement four trench average give average apparent dip 
the fault scarp site trace least side road 
however scarp height maximum next highway decrease upslope disappears road bisect hill slop either side highway

the average expand illitic clay percent 
shale sample also monovalent exchange cation similar sample unlike group lower expand percent small spacing 
these property characteristic divalent exchange cation group indicate sample undergone illitization 
since gypsum find gouge shale fracture surface agree eberl app 
gouge clay become calciumsaturated either though dissolution calcium compound gypsum exposure wet dry cycle calcium bearing water 
therefore upon exposure wet dry cycle presence calciumbearing mineral gouge become less expandable

hoskins finding calcium rich gouge material seem swell degree 
however disaggregated therefore fine size fraction surface area react ground water gouge able swell faster adjacent tightly compact intact shale suggest hammerquist hoskins 
the moisture natural bulk density value indicate increase shale matrix void space westward fault table 
for instance low density material high moisture content suggest material matrix relatively unfilled void space sample higher density lower moisture content 
this void space may result relaxation shale matrix due removal overburden propose nichols other 
the high density find adjacent fault sample could result confine pressure near fault allow shale matrix relax much 
the slightly high moisture content disaggregatedgouge sample result well permeability surface area absorb water intact shale 
the plastic liquid limit data infer plasticity clay compose shale gouge increase toward fault table 
however clay mineralogy suggest opposite material westward fault become plastic high percentage expand 
believe plastic liquid value representative material sample due nature clay bonding could disaggregated properly 
atterberg test design primarily soil sample disaggregated rock sample therefore could cause discrepancy clay mineralogy plastic limit result 
the gouge size fraction support hammerquist hoskins idea gouge result fault grind weather finer grain material find intact shale 
this idea suggest gouge weather yield high percentage finer grain size material 
study laboratory analysis implies comparatively finer size fraction intact shale gouge table 
however mechanical compression fault plane may compress gouge large particle size therefore prevent occurrence high percentage finer grain size

neither site initiation cause knickpoint know branch government draw nearby wash show evidence knickpoint development due recent current deformation 
however fluvial geomorphic study stream length slope tributary stream order change sinuosity indicate recent stream rejuvenation within study area possibly due either glacial rebound tectonic cause jones cecil other 
the information available present show relate movement along fault site 
some basement fault suggest southern part study area lat 
magnitude earthquake occur calculate depth gordon press 
however surface disturbance earthquake find within study area 
therefore know extent basement deformation contribute movement along fault within study area damage highway 
conclusion and summary the fault within study area displacement commonly normal rather reverse separation 
the dominant fault trend within study area northwest northeast 
because gumbo cover impossible follow fault trace much beyond outcrop 
therefore fault study confine artificial natural cut mostly stream valley investigation 
some fault affect streamvalley orientation short distance less 
the fault study far cannot dated young late cretaceous 
present level line data cannot determine study area uplift 
however earthquake suggest basement fault southern part study area 
there also indication either glacial rebound tectonic activity within study area describe jones cecil other fluvial geomorphic study 
although limited movement along fault area believe movement due tectonic activity 
highway damage fault within well outside study area explain past worker result compression stress highway use differential uplift due gouge swell rebound 
from study believe road damage highway study sit result construction induce rebound cause apparent reactivation cretaceous fault 
however believe entire fault reactivate movement occur along upper nearsurface part fault 
this limited rebound response construction excavation relate tectonic induced movement along establish fault plane 
this assumption base finding army corp 
engineer make excavation oahe dam still basin 
underwood other find differential vertical movement result unloading depth small slow less variable rebound induce movement near excavated surface 
they also find deep movement diminish time rapidly near excavate surface 
highway study sit fault natural zone weakness 
result unload rebound would noticeable along fault trace similar report army corp engineer 
addition fault gouge breccia along near fault plane conduit surface water infiltration ground water flow 
this also initiate rapid continue within month rebound construction 
when wet gouge contain smectitic illitic clay expand value percent expand lose frictional strength allow easy rebound movement along fault plane 
the army corp engineer find rebound due excavation characteristically reach maximum near bottom excavation lesser amount near toe side slope decrease negligible amount extremity side slope 
this may explain maximum scarp height find near road site low point road excavation decrease upslope merge slope either side road 
although study note decrease fault gouge thickness depth decrease observe core hammerquist hoskins 
they state near surface less five foot gouge zone often thick inch depth foot gouge thinner usually less inch 
explanation offer upward thicken gouge 
however high content swell clay percent pierre shale nichols other app 
exposure fault zone cyclic wet drying could explain upward thicken gouge 
with cyclic wet drying water infiltration along fault zone nearby fracture shale fault block wall breccia would break desiccation water absorption 
then movement fault add weathered material adjacent fault gouge would develop slickensides 
eventually weathered shale material would distinguishable true fault gouge 
this effect would decrease depth shale would affect much drying remain moist 
thus cyclic wet dry would affect upper part fault zone give overall appearance upwardthickening gouge breccia zone 
prevent slow fault relate rebound induce movement site drain system place within south borrow ditch parallel highway slop away road allow rapid drain surface water infiltration away weather fractured shale fault breccia zone 
this minimize wet dry cycle effect prevent pond highway thus reduce disintegration shale swell clay size fraction would allow easy rebound movement reduction friction along fault plane 
eberl oral commun recommend add gypsum layer highway 
the layer would provide calcium ion exchange sodium ion swell clay shale gouge breccia reduce clay expansion perhaps disintegration due cyclic wet drying 
another consideration allow rebound stablize excavation fill 
downside fault scarp rather relevel road grade excavation 
further excavation would create continued instability could result continue rebound 
site may respond recommendation site place drain near fault road junction gypsum layer slow prevent swell clay fill downside fault scarp rather relevel road grade excavation slow prevent road damage 
generalize similar highway deformation south dakota base study two deformation site practical 
there still number question report raise due time expense begin answer 
for instance fault sit reverse rather normal separation movement unknown 
site water table really exist extent affect deformation 
rebound main cause road deformation ratio amount material remove fault depth amount rebound movement along fault 
the answer question may focus specific mechanism involve shale rebound investigate 
the knickpoint migration toward highway culvert relate uplift fault believe direct result increase drainage area breach dam provide runoff 
problem address within next year culvert structure overlie road damage
