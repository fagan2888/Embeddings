uranium analyse do extraction direct fluorometry untreated sample yield result similar analysis do filter sample acidify nitric acid field 
duplicate sample collect nine site direct comparison ca4 nv6a nv6b nv14 nv18 nv33 ut10 ut18 ut36a 
statistical test pair data show two method sample treatment yield value significantly different 
therefore type result use data matrix

result comparison field measurement fluoride site sample collect laboratory analysis use supplement laboratory data statistical analysis field measurement ion use 
analysis do spec method compare well do method 
direct comparison value possible many site direct comparison possible two site nv18 ut18 
statistical test pair data show significant difference either value due difference analytical method 
value difficult evaluate detection limit high spec data however general distribution value similar distribution spec value report sample 
analysis element do spec method compare well do semi quantitative icp method use study 
analysis element compare well 
direct comparison icp value value possible three site nv18 ut18 ut23 one method analysis use sample collect 
otherwise general comparison icp value value obtain use method rely upon 
value determine icp method appear high therefore icp data show table use statistical analysis 
however value seem comparable value determine spec method generally fall within range plus minus two step report icp value step 
these icp data show table use statistical analysis 
one element show consistently low icp value relative spec data spec data doubtfully high difficult evaluate either icp data spec data 
therefore value show used statistical analysis 
data processing for statistical purpose data sample collect different time analyze different method combine obtain one complete set value give site 
where parameter value one sample give site complement parameter value another sample site combination data relatively straightforward 
where parameter value one sample obtain one method analysis duplicate parameter value another sample selection data complex subjective 
the net result stage data processing data matrix compose one row sample site one column 
most duplicate analysis similar discuss previously extent matter value select 
selection do however certain bias use 
general measurement study favor publish analysis use fill gap data 
field measurement choose laboratory measurement specific conductance field data think well reflect actual environment 
for precision spec data prefer icp data data prefer spec data 
general spec data use data low limit detection high spec data data use order minimize number less value 
data record great upper reporting limit less low limit detection know qualified value 
such data cannot use directly many statistical program omit assigned arbitrary value 
water data particularly troublesome although detection limit trace element analyze icp method constant detection limit element analyze spec method vary total dissolved solid content due interference element 
for study effort make maximize use data still achieve valid statistical analysis 
where less percent data give element study variable detection limit less percent data constant detection limit arbitrary value choose replace qualified value 
where percent data variable detection limit 
percent data constant detection limit qualify value use 
arbitrary value less value choose one fourth low limit detection near one significant digit arbitrary value great value choose two time upper report limit near one significant digit 
most statistical procedure assume normal distribution variable use therefore data best approximate normal distribution parameter need statistical analysis 
distribution parameter value except find generally log normal therefore arithmetic value use statistical analysis logarithmic value use parameter 
statistical analysis relationship among various measure parameter investigate correlation factor analysis inspect scatter diagram 
linear correlation analysis use evaluate pair covarying parameter use data matrix sample parameter 
linear correlation analysis follow mode factor analysis use delineate group covarying parameter use data matrix select sample parameter 
scatter diagram use note pattern spread data point evaluate effect extreme value correlation coefficient 
correlation analysis first do use sample parameter even though sample measure every parameter 
because gap data matrix number valid pair data well value define coefficient significant different nearly every correlation coefficient determine 
the resultant nonsymmetric matrix 
correlation coefficient use conjunction scatter diagram provide mean evaluate relationship among measured parameter 
another correlation analysis do use select sample parameter prerequisite mode factor analysis 
sample parameter select obtain data set value every parameter 
therefore number valid pair data well value define coefficient significant correlation coefficient 
the resultant symmetric matrix correlation coefficient use input factor analysis 
the factor analysis use define group covarying parameter 
the method statistical analysis use report provide objective mean delineate parameter group turn provide basis interpret principle process control composition natural water system study

element specie group include alkali metal monovalent anion 
these specie tend stay solution take solution 
they form chloride sulfate borate salt high solubility near surface subsurface environment therefore attain high concentration water reach level necessary precipitation 
strontium although alkaline earth element also form compound relatively high solubility therefore tend stay solution 
several element factor group moderate secondary loading factor 
iron manganese moderate loading factor slightly lower positive loading factor partial pressure carbon dioxide 
both element form oxide hydroxide relatively insoluble near surface environment 
increase partial pressure carbon dioxide lower increase solubility oxides cause iron manganese solution

several parameter factor group negative loading 
these parameter tend decrease concentration increase temperature 
measure oxidation reduction potential negative temperature high temperature water generally circulate deeply carry much dissolve oxygen shallower circulate low temperature water oxygen may take solution shallow depth likely react high temperature lose surround rock wall rock alteration 
aluminum tend low high temperature high silica water use formation clay mineral wall rock alteration depth 
uranium probably low high temperature water deeply circulate water commonly relatively low uranium form mineral insoluble reduce environment alternatively low temperature water commonly relatively high uranium form bicarbonate phosphate complex soluble oxidize environment 
nitrite nitrate probably low high temperature water deeply circulate water less likely contain organic specie 
may present contaminant low temperature shallow circulating water 
some parameter factor group moderate secondary loading factor duration circulation 
the concentration fluoride tend increase salinity increase solubility fluorite mention affected salinity well temperature 
aluminum also high concentration saline water probably formation aqueous complex 
temperature positively related duration circulation negatively related deep circulating hotter water usually contact rock system long shallow circulate water contain dissolve atmospheric oxygen 
factor partial pressure carbon dioxide strongly related concentration specie involve carbonate equilibrium 
carbon dioxide atmosphere rock hydrogeologic system become dissolved water calcium magnesium also solution 
barium radium alkaline earth element apparently behave similarly calcium magnesium sulfate content water generally remain low enough concentration element control barite solubility spring sample 
this factor group contain bicarbonate carbonate ion alkaline earth element also contain negative loading factor 
carbon dioxide become dissolved water decrease 
therefore spring water contain abundant carbon dioxide note vigorous bubble travertine deposition tend relatively low 
water flow away orifice lose carbon dioxide travertine deposition rise note measurement

although test gas release study example scott barker indicate carbon dioxide common abundant gas many travertine deposit system 
most ion factor group show moderate secondary loading factor 
calcium magnesium negative loading factor depth circulation 
this relationship consistent carbonate equilibrium 
because carbonate mineral solubility know decrease increase temperature concentration calcium magnesium tend high low temperature shallow circulate water high temperature deeper circulate water 
calcium radium bicarbonate positive loading factor duration circulation 
this relationship also reflect carbonate equilibrium 
the solubility mineral calcite increase increase salinity total ionic strength water therefore concentration calcium bicarbonate tend great saline water

factor score compute order evaluate influence identify factor sample used factor analysis 
because uranium miner one identify factor factor score provide direct information relationship particular spring possible miner however factor score quantify influence identify hydrogeologic environmental factor individual spring information use conjunction anomalous radioactivity data evaluate spring 
factor score determine multiply data matrix varimax factor matrix 
the result show standardized form table zero column indicate average influence factor sample high positive score indicate high intensity factor high negative score indicate low intensity 
positive score factor indicate relatively old water positive score factor indicate relatively deep water positive score factor indicate relatively carbonated water 
the sample show every combination positive negative factor score three factor 
the distribution positive negative score sample indicate sample fall two broad category water show positive negative score factor table old deeper circulating water young shallow circulating water 
the first type water characterize relatively 
high salinity high temperature low second type characterize relatively low salinity low temperature high 
either type influence partial pressure carbon dioxide result relatively low high show positive negative score factor 
the rest sample fall two group nominal old shallower circulate water young deeper circulate water show positive score factor negative score factor visa versa 
these water characterize relatively high salinity low temperature high relatively low salinity high temperature low 
again either type influence relatively high low partial pressure carbon dioxide 
the common occurrence first two type water old deeper water young shallow water consistent current concept water circulation hydrogeologic system 
the occurrence last two type water old shallow water young deep water testifies complexity hydrogeologic system 
salinity generally increase time high salinity attain less time rock contain abundant salt high solubility rock porous permeable texture allow maximum contact water surface area mineral grain 
temperature normally increase depth high temperature acquire relatively shallow depth geothermal gradient abnormally high due presence magma body shallow depth 
high temperature acquire depth best preserve rapid rise water surface along fault system however heat lose slow rise surface mix cooler water 
these variation hydrogeologic system result saline water abnormally low 
temperature cool water abnormally high salinity fresh water abnormally high temperature hot water abnormally low salinity 
water designate old shallower young deeper may therefore old deeper young shallow water complex system show abnormally high low temperature salinity 
uranium radium concentration high identify type water variance uranium radium value another indication complexity hydrogeologic system 
the three identify factor table account percent variance uranium value percent variance radium value show communality 
the remain percent variance unexplained 
uranium concentration tend high water relatively low temperature high radium concentration tend high water relatively high amount dissolve carbonate specie low secondarily relatively high salinity 
thus radium uranium concentration vary three identified factor also vary unidentified factor composition common rock system 
radium uranium concentration abnormally high vicinity uranium rich rock 
the occurrence anomalous radioactivity spring may still best indicator uranium rich rock whether simple complex hydrogeologic system 
some sample anomalous radioactiveelement concentration occur first two category water show table mt4 nv28 nv29 ut9a ut10 sample may reflect variation relatively simple hydrogeologic system 
alhambra warm well mt4 grant view hot spring nv29 discuss earlier area know uranium 
occurrence fracture granitic rock 
other sample anomalous radioactive element concentration occur category c014 c015 nv18 ut19 sample may reflect variation complex system may therefore particularly good indicator uranium rich rock vary geologic terranes 
discuss earlier wildhorse spring ut19 spor mountain mining district yellow soda spring c014 taylor soda spring c015 near tallahassee creek uranium district 
these spring know directly associate particular deposit identification anamously radioactive complex spring system make direct association feasible 
monte neva hot spring nv18 also discuss earlier know associated nearby uranium occurrence identification group spring make primary interest uranium exploration 
conclusion multivan ate statistical analysis indicate three major factor affect water composition spring system study duration water circulation depth water circulation partial pressure carbon dioxide 
examination factor score indicate several type hydrogeologic system sample 
most sample simple hydrogeologic system involve old deeper circulating water relatively high salinity high temperature low young shallower circulate water relatively low salinity low temperature high 
the rest sample probably complex hydrogeologic system involve old deeper water young shallow water abnormally high low salinity temperature 
any system relatively high low content dissolve carbonate specie result low high respectively 
uranium concentration commonly high water relatively low temperature high radium concentration commonly high water relatively high carbonate content low secondarily relatively high salinity 
the statistical variance radium uranium concentration unaccounted identified factor also testify complexity hydrogeologic system 
unidentified factor related geologic set presence uranium rich rock system also affect observed concentration radioactive element water 
the association anomalous radioactivity several spring nearby know uranium occurrence indicate spring anomalous radioactivity may also associate uranium occurrence yet undiscovered
