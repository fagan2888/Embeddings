these unit concentration percent ppm ppm eth 
the pattern radiometric unit suggest way discriminate among geologic unit currently map 
radiometric unit find twice eastern side map right mid center correspond distinctive gamma ray signature suggest regard anomalous 
concentration unit percent ppm ppm eth 
the characteristic make unit distinctive low concentration uranium 
radiometric unit occur northwest quadrant area concentration percent ppm ppm eth 
unit correlate ion geologic map unit occur area map basalt andesite jdw gossan tuffaceous pebble sandstone jdql graphitic sandstone jdqg

radiometric unit occur northeastern corner survey area contain percent ppm ppm eth correlate area map wajid sandstone 
radiometric unit contain percent ppm ppm eth find western third area correlate graphitic sandstone unit jdqg qatan formation map greenwood 1980a metasedimentary rock halaban group map sable 
radiometric unit contain percent ppm ppm eth locate mostly within area map alluvium eastern half area 
occurrence radiometric unit limit small right center southeastern corner survey area one occurrence southeastern corner survey area correlate part area map aashiba gneiss complex sable

radiometric unit contain percent ppm ppm eth find mostly area map alluvium eastern half survey area 
occurrence radiometric unit limit one small exception contiguous area unit 
center northeast corner survey area 
unit contain percent ppm ppm eth 
radiometric unit concentration percent ppm ppm eth small occurrence scatter center northeastern corner survey area 
the large area unit correlate sodic amphiboie granite gsa map sable small occurrence within near area map quartz monzonite greenwood 1980b 
there small occurrence radiometric unit northwestern quadrant correlate one geologic map unit 
unit contain percent ppm ppm eth 
radiometric unit leave center northeastern corner survey area contain percent ppm ppm eth correlate area map tfs wajid sandstone greenwood 1980b 
radiometric unit northwestern quadrant southeastern corner survey area correlate one geologic unit although coincide area map diorite area map member qatan formation greenwood 1980b 
unit contain aud ppm eth 
southeastern corner survey area unit partly coincide area map monzogranite sable although map greenwood 1980b show quaternary alluvium area 
instance unit contiguous area unit suggest unit corresponds outcrop alluvium member qatan formation 
radiometric unit present northeastern corner survey area contain percent ppm ppm eth correlate area map wajid sandstone 
radiometric unit contain percent ppm ppm eth find mostly area map alluvium eastern part survey area 
radiometric unit cover large area eastern two third survey area contain percent ppm ppm eth correlate area map alluvium 
radiometric unit show well define correlation quartz monzonite greenwood 1980b monzogranite sable unit also appear relate quartz monzonite monzogranite 
unit contain percent ppm ppm eth unit contain percent ppm ppm eth 
the cited correlation suggest follow 
radiometric unit probably well coincident quaternary alluvium qal 
radiometric unit possibly well related reflect outcrop alluvium quartz monzonite greenwood 1980b monzogranite sable 
radiometric unit relate reflect outcrop alluvium wajid sandstone 
radiometric unit possibly well related 
reflect outcrop alluvium member qatan formation 
map greenwood 1980a 1980b member halaban group 
map sable 
because aerial gamma ray data provide information upper rock soil coverage approximately percent surface area map derive data cannot expect mimic bedrock geologic map 
the map provide representation chemical difference surface material observe geologic correlation use produce radiolithic map map 
ich useful well define extent map geologic unit 
map present radiolithic map unit interpret follow 
unit correspond granite high radioactivity 
unit correspond member qatan formation part wassat formation unit distinguishable unit 
the large occurrence unit correspond gabbro aad scatter small occurrence may indicate presence additional gabbro may reflect inadequacy classification technique use 
unit correspond graphitic sandstone unit qatan formation 
unit correspond diorite dacitic andesitic sediment 
unit correspond wajid sandstone 
unit correspond sodic amphibolc granite 
unit correspond part aashiba gneiss complex 
unit correspond area low radioactivity indication slight potassium enrichment uranium depletion 
unit correspond alluvial detrital material various geologic unit 
the uranium potassium anomaly know map cannot fully interpret without additional field work 
the potassium anomalies mostly associate area map quartz monzonite may reflect potassium alteration relate intrusion quartz monzonite 
some uranium anomaly form well defined north south belt along graphitic metasedimentary unit jdqg western side area 
this belt include high priority uranium anomaly however anomaly relate jabal guyan gold deposit mod significance know 
two large class uranium anomaly coincide tin bear granite near lat long 
northwest trend belt class uranium anomaly occur alluvium near lat long probably reflect detrital material jabal ashirah ring dike complex 
there however significant anomaly associate ring dike complex 
conclusion because perception color human eye complicate sometimes faulty process objective procedure describe use classify composite color radiometric map 
the radiometric map unit define correlation map geology prompt follow conclusion 
the quartz monzonite greenwood 1980b monzogranite sable geologic unit give common name 
similarly area map member qatan formation greenwood 1980a area map member halaban group sable 
radiometric unit map correspond wajid sandstone suggest existence mappable subunit survey area 
neither jabal guyan gold deposit hadbah gossan nickel deposit mod distinctive gamma ray signature associate 
one tin bearing granite significant uranium anomaly associate several small anomaly associate granite survey area 
the approach use objectively classify gamma ray data result map radiometric unit interpret simplified cross reference geologic data
