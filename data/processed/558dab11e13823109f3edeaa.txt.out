acoustic televiewer caliper log indicate two large steeply dip fracture intersect borehole depth approximately 
however flowmeter measurement steady injection indicate almost downflow accept relatively minor fracture depth flow exit two apparently large 
open fracture 
all four produce fracture associate minor geophysical log anomaly similar anomaly correspond minor nonproductive fracture 
well yield enhance pressurizing borehole single packer breakdown follow fluid injection one cycle 
five different depth setting use fracture

comparison geophysical log make hydraulic fracture stimulation identify change two fracture zone substantial increase productivity note 
these result indicate hydraulic fracture stimulation well yield apparently occur improvement fracture interconnection possibly much great distance borehole
