summary the united state public health service propose construction potable water supply port heiden native village meshik 
water availability discuss earlier public health service report 
the following summarizes available information outline probable soil groundwater condition 
soil general consist alluvium beach deposit dune sand glacial deposit volcanic ash deposit 
boggy area likely underlain thin thick organic silt 
depth bedrock know specifically apparently foot grind surface 
bedrock probably consist layer sedimentary shale silty sandstone volcanic breccia sandstone flow rock 
discontinuous permafrost may exist meshik vicinity thick active layer probable 
although permafrost probable within village likely area presence near southeastern shore goldfish lake 
surface water source include nearby shallow lake small stream 
analysis water goldfish lake show high iron content ppm otherwise good quality water 
quality may deteriorate winter ice 
ocean wave contamination goldfish lake could occur severe storm likely 
stream marginally feasible water source due low discharge possible tidal influence likely high dissolve iron content 
shallow well foot produce water individual household village school 
water quality fair poor 
iron content apparently range ppm ppm 
chloride content increase seasonally 
water production decline slightly cold winter 
port heiden area deeper well produce gpm bedrock aquifer 
well log available probable aquifer consist shattered sedimentary porous volcanic rock particularly volcanic breccia vesicular lava 
the water quality fair dissolve iron content ppm 
chloride content low 
construction deep community well meshik recommend 
deep well produce great quality quantity water shallow well would less subject saltwater encroachment 
the deep well drill bedrock intercept bedrock aquifer 
neither case screening require rock portion well 
bedrock likely encountered foot ground surface may deep foot 
bedrock aquifer anticipate betv een foot surface 
drill surface sediment general fairly easy 
however dense gravel cobble boulder may encounter addition well may enter breccia angular coarse rock fragment bedrock sequence

appendix port heiden well report write communication ingersoll public health service 
the port heiden village council request assistance public health service march drill deep well develop water point community 
the indian health service ihs public health service act public law 0mb commence drilling may 
the drilling port heiden well do cable tool pecussion method kirk 11man drill rig 
the formation drill unconsolidated rock mostly glacial origin 
drill unconsol idated material accom piished loosen rock fragment repetitive impact action drill bit produce slurry like mixture water hole 
jet pump supply water nearby goldfish lake 
the drill log formation encounter schematic draw follow page 
the drill log determine examine sample come hole bailing 
first dart valve bailer use later sand pump find efficient 
two size case use site nnch inch 
the outer inch case penetrated foot depth layer low permeability case blue clay 
however due heave problem penetrate properly 
the outer case purpose keep hole open grout seal completion well 
the inside inch case closely follow progress drill bit 
it purpose prevent cave keep hole open unconsolidated material 
many problem occur near end case drive process 
sand heave hole several time much foot 
weld cut pipe casing require frequently drive bump process 
most type work handle henry horner 
show accompany photograph 
build make well location 
there possibility village may move north side goldfish lake year due serious beach erosion problem 
confine aquifer encountered foot depth 
foot slot johnson watermark well screen select instal pull back method 
this screen set bottom case case pull back expose screen 
after set screen outside case bump grout pump annular space 
this first well use grout pump 
work fairly well enough clearance outside inside case move copper tube grout line bottom outside case 
future large outside casing use 
grout mix 
approximately gallon water ibs 
bentonite one sack type portland cement 
initially mix gallon water one bentonite 
coffee add sack cement 
however mix prove much thick pump grout pipe 
all bag concrete available use remain annul fill gravel advise 
development well do surge block assembly 
opment increase permeability natural formation stabilizes sand corrects damage formation 
surge bail do five hour 
many problem occur test pump difficult get constant steady source electricity 
the generator weld unit could supply right voltage pump would stop short period time 
addition village trouble diesel generator would shut intermittantly 
however hour drawdown test obtain run pump constant gallon per minute gpm 
the quality water visibly poor due high iron content lab test run sample result follow page 
also note rough level run high tide mark bristol bay approximately foot well 
the top casing find foot high tide mark would mean static water level well approximately foot head high tide 
thus pump avoid due threat salt water intrusion 
the maximum transmitting capacity well slot screen recommend entrance velocity sec calculate multiply number square inch open area factor reference groundwater well johnson 
transmit gpm gpm capacity the well test pump gpm less transmitting capacity screen 
after test pumping concentrated solution hth dry chlorine water pour well disinfection purpose 
finally rig take apart transport airport 
basically mast take frame engine drag skid airport
