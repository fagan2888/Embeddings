introduction the june eruption 
pinatubo produce prodigious volume relatively fine grain pyroclastic fall flow deposit cover thousand square kilometer

these effect typically alter hydrologic response steep upland slope rainfall segerstrom waldron lehre other janda other 1984a leavesley other 
more water run proportionately surface runoff

large erosive flood flow produce quickly upland slope rain storm runoff becomes concentrated valley already choke vast quantity easily credible sediment 
erodible pyroclastic valley fill provide source sediment debris flows1 hyperconcentrated flows2 collectively termed lahar sediment laden normal streamflow

strategy mitigate lahar hazard for human population three basic strategy use mitigate lahar hazard prevent human settlement hazardous area allow people live hazardous area provide nearby safe refuge warning approach lahar people escape high ground lahar arrive prevent lahar reach settle area either hold flow back divert channel lahar along harmless flow path 
the first strategy legally sociologically impracticable country 
viable option 
pinatubo hundred thousand people already occupy hazardous area 
the second strategy feasible warn system highly reliable safe refuge quickly accessible distance lahar detection point population center great enough allow sufficient time evacuation 
these condition generally meet 
even though combination remote radio telemetered warn system human observer use 
pinatubo system failure occur 
the flat topography alluvial fan offer natural refuge population evacuate unless refuge mound construct bedrock hill exist nearby 
furthermore relatively short distance lahar source area population center mean population would typically less hour respond warning 
addition strategy nothing protect building road bridge livestock agricultural resource 
the third strategy construction engineering work hold promise effective lahar hazard mitigation 
but high cost term money land need sediment storage make expensive option 
many significant problem could encounter engineering approach hazard mitigation discuss follow section 
ultimately best strategy could combination three strategy present 
the approach mutually exclusive 
engineering approach mitigation under appropriate physiographic geologic circumstance lahars either trap dam retention basins reach settle area rout safely settle area engineer channel
