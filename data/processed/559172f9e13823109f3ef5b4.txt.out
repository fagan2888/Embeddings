the deltaic deposit rework southward strong longshore current form prominent gravel bar spit include main part draper spit 
the bar spit extend completely across valley big cottonwood little cottonwood dry creek cut post alpine lake recession

this mature soil widespread pedocal facies suggest climate appreciably warmer yet semiarid word true interglacial interpluvial climate 
late lake bonneville draper and post lake bonneville time the late lake cycle lake bonneville record draper formation 
the first lake maximum reach altitude foot within foot provo level 
this maximum seem brief accompany comparatively slight longshore drift much less bonneville maximum indicate strong wave absent high shoreline poorly mark shore terrace geomorphic feature deposit relatively scanty

recession third lake maximum draper time terminate history lake bonneville part jordan valley 
this recession mark trend increase aridity culminate extremely arid interval correlate early part altithermal age antevs 
this interval start year ago characterize climate warmer arid today accordingly reduce vegetative cover 
also windy interval interval mark wind erosion extensive deposition loess eolian sand 
the great salt lake area undoubtedly completely desiccate much interval wasatch range completely deglaciated 
during later altithermal time eolian erosion deposition virtually ceased submature soil midvale soil form 
the soil form interval probably last year obviously time accelerated chemical weathering 
short interval active chemical weather draper later time least time longer 
for soil development climate must continue remain appreciably warm precipitation also must increase moderately els continue aridity would inhibit soil development 
the local pedocal facies soil jordan valley indicate semiarid climate 
probably evaporation rate remain high enough great salt lake area remain essentially playa 
have lower base level jordan river tributary gradually incise valley nearly present depth 
the time since midvale soil form year interpret represent recent epoch 
the early part epoch mark formation strath terrace along little cottonwood big cottonwood creek along low jordan river also minor stade glaciation small glacier form high cirque basin 
subsequently erosion alluviation decrease weak early recent soil form glacier probably melt completely 
late recent time main stream trench foot deep form present flood plain another stade glaciation small precede one temporarily reactivate glacier higher cirque
