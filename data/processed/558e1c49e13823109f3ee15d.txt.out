determine distribution barium pluton lee doer surprised find well defined trend toward low barium value felsic rock

these writer conclude distribution barium hybrid granitoid rock control partly barium content various sedimentary rock type assimilate 
the present paper present additional data suggest distribution barium describe lee doer unusual granitoid rock general

apparent figure sample notably rich barium especially true barium rich nature sediment cut pluton sample come consider 
discussion the distribution coefficient minor element degree incorporation specific mineral 
for barium define follow concentration barium phenocryst concentration barium melt 
consideration barium distribution coefficient different mineral give idea barium behave crystallization mineral 
this may help understand distribution point figure 
the barium distribution coefficient consider calculate empirically publish data 
for example barium content phenocrysts may compare ground mass volcanic rock assume equilibrium condition 
the exact barium content give mineral particular rock depend many factor pressure temperature availability barium presence compete element structure mineral it position sequence separation melt parameter puchelt 
however apparent second order factor report distribution coefficient barium order magnitude hedge write commun

granitoid rock show figure biotites potassium feldspar among major rock forming mineral find concentrate barium relative matrix 
therefore one might expect low barium content basic rock form either biotite potassium feldspar begin crystallize 
biotite begin crystallize rock contain large amount barium still large amount might expect rock contain biotite potassium feldspar 
the residual melt would deplete barium leave little available felsic rock begin crystallize 
such combination factor might explain low barium content find felsic rock fig
