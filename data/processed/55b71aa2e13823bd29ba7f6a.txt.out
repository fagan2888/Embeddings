from figure give table see moisture considerably high trafton coal stone canyon coal may account difference condition two place 
the coal sample obtain stone canyon exceedingly dry trafton show evidence presence moisture 
the high percentage moisture also tend give high percentage oxygen ultimate analysis course detrimental coal

another mark difference composition coal relative percentage volatile matter fix carbon 
the stone canyon coal remarkable carry much great amount volatile matter fix carbon whereas trafton coal carry considerably less volatile matter fix carbon 
this detrimental trafton coal thing equal carbon important fuel constituent coal 
the stone canyon coal account heavy percentage volatile matter would make ideal gas coal fact carry large proportion sulphur 
the trafton coal hand would economical coal purpose 
compare heat value two sample see stone canyon coal run british thermal unit whereas trafton coal run 
this difference due largely heavy percentage ash moisture trafton coal 
when two coal reduce moisture ash free basis line mark pure coal difference great 
this mean coal without attendant impurity nearly present condition 
there general impression much sulphur trafton coal present sulphate sulphide 
this idea seem support white film occur upon weathered surface

this seem effectually settle question condition sulphur trafton coal undoubtedly sulphur stone canyon coal

general coal trafton mine consider high grade would seem fair fuel domestic steam purpose present sufficient quantity transportation available satisfactory market 
with regard former condition may say trafton coal bed trace along outcrop sufficient distance determine whether valuable supply 
short distance south mine franciscan rock cross section nearly east west direction 
the coal bed continuous would abut directly contact fact seem indicate two body rock separate fault 
unconformity generally case 
the coal bed expose distance hundred yard extensive prospecting along outcrop diamond drilling far back basin would necessary determine extent field do reliable estimate make amount available coal
