this relationship illustrate displacement line line figure 
the precipitation line craig present day colorado nevada precipitation data superimpose 
ground surface water data colorado plot right precipitation line indicate small fractionation recharge process 
this fractionation likely due evaporation climate little humidity suggest font other investigator 
assume paleoclimate existed time recharge occur amargosa desert precipitation isotopic characteristic similar contemporary precipitation 
comparison isotopic composition ground water amargosa desert precipitation show appropriate shift toward heavy oxygen isotope content ground water range value indicate snowmelt runoff source 
this shift similar observe ground surface water colorado whose source colder climate probable paleoclimate amargosa desert 
the isotopic shift occur result different fractionation factor evaporation 
furthermore difference isotopic composition exist ground water tuffaceous valley fill near amargosa river 
this similarity indicate similar recharge mechanism occur similar climatic regime 
because water valley fill along amargosa river tuffaceous valley fill fortymile canyon 2dissimilar large salt accumulation correspond complete evaporation oppose concentration evaporation must responsible 
the concentration evaporation process result parallel increase heavy isotope content solute concentration increase

several approach use correct age caco dilution understanding reaction these approach involve either simple isotope dilution model equilibrium exchange model combination wigley other example application model see shampine other pearson swarzenki q974 deines other rightmire hanshaw

for reaction silicate rock without precipitation carbonate specie carbon isotope content ground water must equate carbon isotope composition recharge water 
because surface runoff propose principal recharge mechanism dissolve source responsible dissolve inorganic carbon ground water might expect primarily atmosphere

ground water tuffaceous valley fill cand bedrock median mean inconsistent development equilibrium condition 
point runoff either evaporate becomes recharge 
evaporation result deposition readily resoluble sparingly soluble salt 
recharge runoff require soluble salt carry water table inorganic carbon 
evaporate runoff great significant fraction inorganic carbon form ccl ion whereas hco predominate 
reaction rate runoff slow compare rate incorporation atmospheric tend stay relatively low whereas increase reaction rate relatively fast 
latter instance evaporation may result formation caco presumably caliche former case readily soluble salt deposit 
lattman observe cement alluvial fan progress readily carbonate basic igneous rock terrane least readily silicic igneous detritus 
because weather rate reaction rate greatest carbonate basic igneous rock runoff terranes expect great therefore would result great probability caco formation 
tuff average runoff expect less evaporation result soluble salt deposit 
this result also promote ion pair formation decrease activity 
these soluble salt either carry farther surface gradient recharge subsequent runoff 
all step occur runoff recharge non equilibrium therefore subject significant carbonisotope fractionation 
this result recharge water carbon isotope composition identical average runoff 
this estimate somewhat negative atmospheric deviation atmospheric value depend quantity vegetation derive include 
runoff recharge high elevation closer head drainage might expect negative value vegetation dense contributes great proportion compare runoff lower elevation 
the runoff high elevation also contain less total inorganic carbon time open system condition prevail shorter 
reach surface runoff recharge increase great proportion atmospheric ccl incorporate 
runoff vegetation sparse low elevation contribute less total total inorganic carbon increase increase reaction time

almost geochemists study arid semiarid hydrologic environment use carbon isotope data aid understanding system concerned effect caliche carbon isotope composition ground water 
this concern necessitate evaluation importance caliche determine isotope composition amargosa desert vicinity

one explanation absence age great 
artifact well location completion 
most well penetrate top hundred meter saturate thickness part aquifer expect contain young recently recharge water 
the data examine determine whether control factor determine ground water age correlation obtain rather position well relative surface drainage dominate 
deeper well yield old water well far remove surface drainageways 
well penetrate significant thickness saturate valley fill bedrock great age difference apparent example site well nevada test site depth saturate thickness amargosa well site well depth saturate thickness site well depth saturate thickness site well depth saturate thickness site well depth saturate thickness water well age 
water well least saturated thickness old age water well greatest saturate thickness young age table 
probably major produce zone well near water table water top aquifer remove upper part section would expect contain young water 
further indication relationship well depth major produce interval may true bedrock aquifer obtain compare water age construction well sit claassen 
both well penetrate major produce zone deeper 
well performance record indicate great depth well result increase capacity little water obtain great depth interval 
the old groundwater age year older may indicate old water produce interval penetrate although age difference borderline significance percent confidence level 
another possible explanation lack ground water age tuff great 
permeability characteristic aquifer sample old ground water move beyond 
study area 
assume significant recharge also occur 
end next near significant interstade ground water may leave region sample study 
for example ground water recharge occur near well nevada test site site represent head fortymile canyon downgradient flow occur permeable part canyon subsurface toward site velocity would meter per annum recharge 
these velocity agree approximately calculate limited hydraulic data waddell geological survey write commun 
this agreement may add credence argument large range parameter estimate result similar velocity 
third explanation favor author base recently complete study past climate nevada test site spaulding university washington write commun 
use argument base primarily change vegetation near nevada test site spaulding concludes average annual precipitation percent great current precipitation although much increase winter month 
during late wisconsin however average annual precipitation increase percent great current precipitation percent increase winter component 
although middle late wisconsin represent significant cool late wisconsin yield evidence significant increase winter precipitation 
this author conclude saowfall earlier 
insufficient result snowmelt recharge subsequent climatic condition cause recharge 
this interpretation result estimate ground water velocity amargosa desert considerably slower previously state 
significant recharge occur prior disappearance need account 
for example assume recharge near head fortymile canyon occur year ago flow low end canyon sample 
the velocity calculate must maximum 
because recharge may occur anywhere necessarily everywhere along surface drainageways probable minimum velocity calculate 
the absence water old even near head fortymile canyon would favor velocity slow 
the problem ash tree spring ash tree spring site locate approximately line trend tuff derive water central part study area trough water quality map water spring believe naff winograd thordarson derive similar mechanism surface runoff infiltration valley fill 
dissolvedion chemical data generally support hypothesis although small calcium large magnesium concentration small deviation 
however isotope hydraulic data contradict chemical data 
the 14c age mark contrast much young age upgradient ground water part valley fill downgradient fortymile canyon 
furthermore water level altitude spring approximately higher water level well within spring 
the near well also contain water different quality water ash tree spring see analysis site example table 
this difference note naff winograd thordarson 
two hypothesis offer reasonable explanation origin water ash tree spring 
the first hypothesis require water level altitude ash tree spring represent recharge valley fill time land surface high today 
subsequent erosion subsidence leave presumably resistant aquifer material ash tree spring topographically high surround valley fill formerly saturate material simply drain 
flow constant present day discharge cubic meter per second year approximately cubic meter aquifer percent porosity would dewatered 
original great thickness aquifer estimate difference elevation ash tree spring present day water level area dewatered square meter square side 
surficial material variable throughout area seem unlikely 
could contain appear simple tuff derive water quality however possibility cannot rule 
the second hypothesis require recharge ash tree spring originate different source source recharge valley fill northwest 
conduit provide flow path less isolated lakebeds valley fill surround ash tree spring would require conduit may provide sandstone claystone map denney drew vicinity southeast spring 
this formation dip approximately northwest probably continuous spring near summit rest spring range 
possible recharge occur quartzite comprises summit range travel downdip fracture 
sandstone toward ash tree spring discharge aquifer abut less permeable lakebeds 
lithology sandstone claystone include conglomerate quartzite limestone dolomite tuff denney drew l18 state layer white tuff contain pumice fragment common 
one two bed fine grain limestone occur lower part formation 
the common presence volcanic glass generally support tuff like characteristic water formation effect interaction limestone dolomite cannot dismiss 
the predominance tuff compare carbonate unit similarity hco concentration ash tree spring water water find tuffaceous rock would tend minimize effect carbonate rock determine water quality 
summary and conclusion all available data ground water quality west central amargosa desert apply development conceptual geochemical model hydrologic regime 
hydraulic geologic lithologic data region also incorporate need 
result indicate ground water recharge valley fill primarily overland flow near present day stream channel 
the flow probably derive snowmelt 
numerous small flood occur result recharge 
frequency effective recharge depend primarily 
channel geometry vertical permeability valley fill 
the majorion chemical composition result ground water determine lithology rock fragment comprise stream channel subsurface well soluble salt remain evaporation numerous non recharge event 
recharge valley fill compose fragment tuff carbonate mixture two playa deposit result distinctly discernible water quality

each area occasionally show effect playa deposit ground water vicinity deposit con tains great concentration conservative ion water associate deposit
