land use information and classification conference introduction arch gerlach chief geographer geological survey washington chairman steer committee plan conference privelege welcome thank attend express hope find conference stimulate beneficial 
take active part two half day workshop session follow open plenary meeting surely play significant role create system date national overview land use trend united state 
while make land use map recently publish national atlas united state become painfully aware put together bit piece land use information gather regional state local agency different date scale incompatible category provide national pattern high validity even atlas scale 
remedy situation seem highly desirable federal agency land use classification system receptive data input remote sensor high altitude aircraft satellite platform obtain frequent synoptic overview entire country 
equally important national system constitute framework broad category detail land use study regional state local agency aggregate upward generalize small scale use national level 
member conference steer committee well aware objective new one many commendable scheme land use classification develop united state many foreign land 
become even acutely aware situation correspondence telephone call invitee conference call attention certain important classification system include among four select example background document conference 
the selection land use classification scheme documentation intend provide example discussion rather model follow 
publication authorize director geological survey 
this conference take root six month ago meet official department interior eros program nasa earth resource survey jointly support geographic application program geological survey 
they note geographic program focus largely around land use impact surround environmental complex include natural socio economic element complex 
question raise whether land use information system forecast model develop truly meet user need might suitable adoption national basis federal agency concern nation wide pattern trend impact land use 
the geographic application program involve three year contractual research university work group association american geographer extensive literature search many multidisciplinary contact intensive study dozen land use policy act bill introduce congress period 
decide therefore hold conference land use data user steer committee chairmanship name plan organize conference 
the member steer committee list top agenda sheet 
they take active role conference speaker section chairman reporter resource staff discussion panel 
they dominate meeting impose view upon provide information gather facts experience need 
the primary focus conference open plenary session view experience need 
clearly need federal agency include synoptic overview national land use pattern trend environmental impact input conventional data source exotic sensor high altitude aircraft satellite 
deeply concerned need also great compatibility exist date scale category land use information regional state local level 
such compatibility become increasingly critical contemplate attempt state local organization comply requirement water resource plan act national environmental policy act senate bill plus related house representative bill currently 92nd congress 
feel provision related bill act congress pertain national land use policy give full consideration along experience foreign government successful make land use analyse large scale around small scale range japan australia 
instead provide additional background information conference shall turn substantive portion plenary session introduce first speaker want present conference manager john place also member steer committee geographic application program staff 
assist mr betty graziani prepare document obtain room projection equipment operator tape recorder sound system equipment registration coffee service morning break many detail essential operating conference 
either helpful conference hesitate call upon 
land use classification scheme and the need for standardization james andersen university florida gainesville florida introduction although unlikely one ideal classification land use ever develop grow appreciation need standardize approach land use classification 
must also recognize process make classification land use subjective matter even though objective numerical approach use 
therefore quite necessary prepared accommodate different perspective classification land use 
indeed encouraging note several significant effort local state federal level resolve difference among classification scheme hamper effective use land use statistic plan management purpose 
excellent example coordinate effort attain land use data compatibility within metropolitan plan area may find right washington 
under sponsorship metropolitan washington council government district columbia government department housing urban development demonstration project recently complete 
the purpose project demonstrate land data make available compatible form local government source within complex metropolitan area actual operating metropolitan data system base effort kind help greatly attain effective standardization classification land use 
similar effort among state government would likewise contribute much toward get uniformity classification nation whole 
one truly great landmark develop uniform classification scheme entire country take place britain dudley stamp able organize execute much help many person splendid land use survey whole country 
this first british land use survey truly remarkable effort standpoint effective involvement school child throughout nation data collection process 
the great worth nationwide land use survey clearly demonstrate britain enter war soon face extremely difficult task increase food production within country 
after war land use information map available survey form firm foundation effective national plan reconstruction economy 
second land utilization survey britain complete 
survey expand categorization use metropolitan planning data local government demonstration land use compatibility metropolitan washington council government 
basic framework original classification scheme maintain 
the completion two survey year apart compatible classification scheme offer excellent opportunity study land use change 
professor stamp go play major role organization work world land use survey commission international geographical union 
the report commission publish presented land use classification scheme use worldwide basis 
although ambitious idea map whole world scale never realize effort original continue commission contribute much toward develop awareness need standardize approach gather land use data global basis 
matter fact food agriculture organization united nation adopt similar basic set land use category annual reporting land use data member nation 
table land use data publish annually production yearbook organization base classification scheme 
conference objectives the main purpose conference provide opportunity interested person discuss feasibility utility standardize classification land use take initial step devise classification scheme framework effectively serve wide array need 
remote sense technique include use conventional aerial photography capability effectively complete survey base ground observation enumeration 
the development adoption compatible scheme classify land use information obtain different way urgently need 
conference bring together representative cross section user land use information seem appropriate first step devise national framework land use classification 
satisfy need federal agency date overview land use throughout country basis uniform date scale categorization first second digit level 
utilize best feature exist widely use classification scheme 
provide open end classification system enable regional state local agency develop detailed land use classification scheme third fourth digit level meet particular need still compatible national system

need for standardization during decade grow sense need attention standardization land use classification much evidence 
would like cite many event report group contribute movement toward partially satisfactory solution difficult longstanding problem 
resource future publish book entitle land use information critical survey statistic include possibility great uniformity 
this book write marion clawson charles stewart follow series meeting committee land use statistic hold sunny winter auspex resource future 
clawson spend many year public service eminently well qualified serve chairman committee take leadership prepare report base part activity committee 
the main thrust report identical central purpose conference hold joint sponsorship department interior earth resource observation system eros program national aeronautics space administration earth resource survey er program 
major contribution book land use information careful enlighten discussion concept land need give careful attention land location parcel identification 
activity approach classification land use strongly recommend defended basic condition attainment great uniformity classification 
the element improve system land use statistic united state present last chapter 
several informative appendix present information interest several federal agency land use data 
also publish standard land use cod manual another landmark contribute toward attainment great uniformity classify land use 
the cod manual release jointly urban renewal administration bureau public road 
the classification scheme also reproduce entirety appendix land use information 
far feasible standard land use cod manual incorporated category title detail identification activity standard industrial classification sic prepare bureau thp budget publish 
the standard system cod land use activity publish comprise nine one digit category two assign manufacture two digit category three digit category four digit category 
part result publication ura bpr report recognition need cooperation among local government metropolitan area many significant step toward great standardization land use statistic take recent year 
already mention work metropolitan washington council government 
several example cooperation standardization cite include tri state transportation commission association bay area government delaware valley regional plan commission association central oklahoma government southern california regional information study 
the ura bpr report help establish guideline standardization land use classification scheme use metropolitan government 
state also various way occasion work together study land use condition 
all familiar tennessee valley authority land use study carry direction 
numerous river basin commission establish common guideline study land water resource within respective basin 
quite recently number state government authorize statewide planning activity necessitate uniform approach collection handle lan use data 
however yet knowledge mechanism bring uniform approach land use classification among state 
two fine state wide study land use recently undertake minnesota new york 
new york study carry new york state office planning coordination prime responsibility land use natural resource inventory lunr assign center aerial photographic study cornell university 
the minnesota state planning agency contract minnesota land management information system study university minnesota 
both state prepare quality land use inventory approach land use classification strikingly different 
minnesota use nine category classification current land use new york complex scheme distinguishes area point data 
achieve great compatibility two scheme order provide effective overview land use throughout united state require considerable additional effort 
what need national framework land use classification standard land use cod manual urban renewal admin bureau public road washington 
provide effective overview time enable regional state local agency develop detailed land use classification scheme meet particular need still compatible national system 
would like take moment mention significant international symposium hold london april 
the paper present symposium subsequently publish occasional paper 
world land use survey international geographical union 
the main focus symposium examine new possibility technique land use relate survey special reference develop country 
clearly implied justification hold meet need international cooperation carry land use inventory mapping activity 
certainly nasa plan launch satellite undertake earth resource survey need ever obvious 
review recent attempt bring coordinate effort standardize land use classification would remiss mention longstanding continue effort several federal agency achieve maintain compatibility continuity collection handle land use data 
addition agency already cite note work bureau census several agency department agriculture include economic research service forest service soil conservation service statistical reporting service agency department interior assign responsibility management million acres federally own land 
there long concern duplication coordination among federal state local government collection handle many different type data 
instance achieve reasonably effective though perfect solution evidence present program soil survey topographic mapping collection weather information inventory forest resource 
the current need effective approach cooperation respect land use data become evident crucial 
mention reason sense urgency develop effective program relate collection handle land use data 
study focus dynamic land use change order gain well understanding force contribute change must base sophisticated data meaningful 
there need relate current use land resource many economic social physical characteristic land detailed precise manner

part several different concept hold land exists similar range idea land use 
attempt arrive common precise definition land use satisfy diverse user term likely meet great success 
however real need reach general area agreement term mean wrestle effectively problem standardization classification land us 
the committee land use statistic mention earlier grappled length matter

distribute john hopkins press baltimore 
more recently study metropolitan plan data local government previously refer recognize complexity concept land use 
those undertake study conclude often several concept wrap single classification scheme hide many important type information need analyze 
thus conclusion reach group way similar arrive five year earlier committee land use statistic recommendation clarification term land use quite different 
for purpose analysis land use define include follow dimension

after see two foot water apartment gainesville florida last year observe spetic field work wonder urban plan recognize dimension explicitedly 
return quotation important recognize follow statement section report several thousand term analyze 
they come number different classification scheme present great diversity terminology even essentially concept 
therefore necessary adopt standard cod system facilitate comparison 
the standard land use cod manual prepared urban renewal administration bureau public road ura bpr choose although metropolitan plan data local government ibid 
provide classification cod system activity dimension 
provide cod system location ownership governmental contractual restriction use building type intensity use additional characteristic need get full description land use 
activity alone course contain information normally find among land use classification presently use local government 
thus additional code must devise supplementing activity code order preserve make available data local government use 
agree wholeheartedly latter conclusion 
however remind conference concern 
classification standardization activity dimension much though 
need exist work area 
this restrict 
focus conference relate directly immediately problem 
try obtain maintain effective degree compatibility 
main category land use activity dimension classification 
analysis data obtain ert skylab satellite 
data collection and cost 
several alternative available collection land use information 
five basic approach generally use ground observation enumeration air photo interpretation remote sense combination first four approach mention 
probably remote sense least understood since recent approach use 
actually course remote sense extension air photo interpretation reality use aerial photograph gathering land use information appropriately consider general term remote sense recently come widespread use 
certain situation approach land use data collection may use primary even sole method collect information land resource use 
remote area sparse population advantage get kind information use remote sense technique fairly obvious 
hand densely settle part world complexity land use pattern may make ground observation enumeration essential 
many instance however land use survey carry use vary combination basic approach list 
generally critical question pose 
what single approach combination data collection approach yield data kind need least cost time constraint present 
tri state transportation commission operate highly urbanized situation employ person extensive land 
recently economic research service make survey land use change low mississippi alluvial valley sample basis require one one half man day determine change occur select point yield reliable data county average size complexity land use pattern 
both approach valid data requirement need agency 
often difficult determine single combine approach data collection yield information kind accuracy need least cost 
when question data cost examine another perspective become fairly evident instance exist source land use information collect specific purpose agency responsible administer particular program must utilize 
the major obvious exception statement data collection program bureau census 
even need reapportion congress every ten year believe initial basis census population 
thus data collection generally authorize federal state local level government need implement specific program diverse area property tax assessment urban regional planning management public land establishment restriction use public land 
this fundamental issue context conference 
extent cooperation coordination among agency operate level government result great efficiency collection land use data 
can coordinate approach realize without seriously hamper many agency user specific data need 
certainly think kind data always collect maintain user agency 
however convinced kind land use data collect stored retrieve data bank available user kind cost sharing arrangement 
land use classification scheme examine earlier systematic attempt devise scheme classify land country elsewhere stem mainly desire understand distribution agricultural activity condition affect production agricultural commodity

conservation service period 
land committee national resource plan board prepare special report land classification united state publish 
the land classification activity department agriculture department interior represent committee membership four person carleton barn department agriculture john deeds geological survey 
thus decade great interest improve methodology land classification 
however interest land use predominantly focus rural area 
some attention give urban land use period entirely different perspective 
the ruralurban fringe dynamic meeting place rural urban orient land use become important issue 
the pressure find land recreational activity rural urban setting yet develop 
the interstate highway system transportation improvement major impact mid 
environmental quality pollution infrequently discuss among interest responsibility plan managing use land resource 
some problem confront conference today historically related relative lack need pre world war year coordinate study land use rural urban situation 
order provide framework group discussion conference give outline format four land use classification scheme use recently land use inventory survey 
see appendix three classification scheme develop use country wide national basis scheme devise use state new york 
however three national scheme differ significantly level inventory detail contemplate use 
the standard land use cod manual provide four digit categorization land use develop mainly use urban adjacent situation united state 
this classification scheme design specifically use air photo interpretation remote sense technique 
ground observation enumeration obviously must provide much information necessary classify land use scheme use urban area 
the canada land inventory employ essentially two digit twolevel land use classification scheme use throughout settled part canada 
map present land use compile scale use scheme six major first order category second order category two third order category 
obviously scope objective canadian inventory necessitate much generalize scheme classify land use situation standard land use cod manual primarily prepare 
still another scheme specifically present tentative land use classification scheme use orbital imagery compliment use ground observation enumeration 
this classification scheme product study carry commission geographic application remote sense association american geographer 
the scale use pilot study phoenix arizona area test capability scheme use mainly conventional color color infrared imagery take apollo high altitude aircraft foot 
this imagery supplement use mosaic black white photography scale pilot project 
the scheme seven first order category second order category third order category 
fourth even fifth order category add would appropriate use large scale imagery extensive use ground observation enumeration 
the new york state land use natural resource inventory classification scheme develop mainly center aerial photographic study cornell university 
the scheme course devise specifically use state new york although quite adaptable use elsewhere 
furthermore important recognize scheme use aerial photography scale 
aerial photography contribute percent land use data obtain inventory 
the categorization develop accommodate recognition areal point data 
four land use classification scheme review discuss conference remember great need exists country around world obtain much information land use related condition cheaply accurately possible 
recently publish study carry center aerial photographic study cornell university economic research service department agriculture pose significant question suggest preliminary conclusion prior launch ert skylab satellite 
this study publish april year entitle land use classification simulate satellite photography 
number significant question pose preface study will new satellite system eliminate need conventional land use data gathering system 
will new system merely supplement old system extent 
will data new remote sense system compatible data series earlier year use economic resfarch service 
belcher donald hardy ernest phillips elmer land use classification simulate satellite photography 
economic research service dept 
agriculture washington iii 
will definitions major land use category modify 
what limitation expect satellite data present realistic picture land use 
conclusion reach base simulation satellite scale photography estimate quality photography 
these conclusion quote directly report 
the land use classification system currently use department agriculture compatible satellite photography 
approximately percent data require periodic land use report obtain satellite photography 
additional percent require information inferentially derive satellite photography supplementary source 
estimate percent data include periodic report cannot obtain satellite photography 
example agricultural information satellite photography cannot provide include land ownership end use specific crop fee seed human consumption transitional vegetation area multiple use area pastureland revert forest cropland use pasture 
weather condition serious inhibit factor successful use satellite photography type 
this limitation would tend minimize department continue issue periodic land use report fiveyear interval

plan information system particularly appropriate important remote sense data collection agency whether data come aircraft spacecraft platform part deliberation user 
the reason deliberately plan collection format fit information system easily 
vacuum give rather dreadful time try reformat data collect format information system plan 
even though part user community need aware kind discussion plan take place user community 
what go show unconventional sensor 
then hardy talk conventional air photos information system derive air photo 
try however stay realm pictorial format even though information different part electromagnetic spectrum air photo 
figure show conventional black white air photo unconventional thing photo take nearly foot inch camera 
the point make collection system film lenses far advanced 
illustration note airport lower part airport golf course although recognize 
however get color infrared photograph figure link green tee golf course show exceedingly well 
rather exotic mapping mission program 
most concerned ocean coastal mapping important offshore map important application department interior well agency government 
figure simply show select right frequency penetrate water exceedingly well bottom feature start able mapped 
the micrometer region best purpose near shore 
deep water ocean bluer switch green blue 
the eye rather poor tool judge merit 
color photograph analog technique density slice powerful method demonstrate differential depth penetration 
indeed sometimes use map surface feature bottom feature grass different type sand 
interest radar image illustrate figure 
the ctruclar feature rather strikingly apparent image previously know much less apparent air photo show next information fact contribute geologic map area 
conduct experiment use oblique photography get somewhat kind information radar acquire oblique look device 
however strangely enough high resolution photograph interfere morphology terrain look 
you get confused detail photograph integrate detail somewhat low resolution radar surface feature tend stand 
there lot discussion whether radar fact penetrate foliage give return simply surface perhaps wavelength band may true 
use different polarization instrument additional information obtain 
the bottom frequency horizontally propogated horizontally receive 
figure see kelp bed point quite vividly polarization 
the upper image horizontally propogated also vertical component record antenna 
although kelp bed would certainly miss hurry 
the interpreter eye brain aid improvement many device 
know kelp bed could probably find 
but unknown case aid interpretation important indeed especially interpretation team work large area 
switch radar thermal infrared imagery become fairly popular different kind map become important feasible 
thermal infrared imagery figure show discharge industrial plant 
you see plant thermal plume follow 
thermal plume map becomes important regulatory sense particularly environmental protection agency issue regulation respect discharge 
fully expect kind imagery properly calibrate used evidence court proceeding respect thermal effluent 
figure show rather interesting thermal feature pacific plume rather inversion layer ocean 
look closely 
see plume actually prevent spreading ocean another thermal anomaly case cold water 
the non image sensor figure refer rather important mineral exploration start learn instrument 
this spectrometer type go flown skylab 
sensitive frequency domain 
this happen spectra entirely thermal infrared region 
take spectra different rock type instrument 
see considerable difference pulse shape return different rock type 
this instrument airborne aircraft houston 
expanded frequency domain several order magnitude simply radiation characteristic earth surface require look beyond visible spectrum even though difficult convert data image 
the information seek simply visible domain 
the information vegetation non visible frequency 
course go make map spatial information best contain visible spectrum 
but data permit separate vegetation class sometimes species certainly visible domain 
the rbv refer bottom line figure return beam vidican camera ert 
the mss multispectral scanner ert ms erts indicate go channel device second spacecraft acquire high resolution thermal infrared data surface 
skylab sensor centimeter wavelength region 
look frequency domain ultraviolet practically radio wave 
the sensor go talk multispectral scanner show figure 
and reason go spend much time achieve something rather important particular instrument spatial registration channel 
try describe feature surface earth amplitude response ultraviolet response visible near middle thermal infrared channel one two choice 
you either collect data spatial registry use single instrument decide pay penalty create rubber map computer take output product number different sensor reformat mean literally stretch achieve registry 
necessary overlay data resolution element resolution element describe patch terrain different wavelength band 
this optical mechanical scanner 
single optic 
the visible spectrum split prisms spectrometer this particular one show prism fiber optic people call light pipe photomultiplier tube light energy 
change electrical energy record tape recorder 
similarly non visible emissive part spectrum micrometer micrometer split focus detector array convert electrical energy 
you record multi tract tape recorder 
figure show multi tract tape look like schematic sense 
neglect mention one important attribute kind device calibrate 
case show two calibration pulse 
one could take first one grey scale calibration black body reference second calibration pulse 
the problem thermal channel really want talk temperature know emissivity object device measure temperature directly measure temperature multiply emissivity 
the research program understand relationship actually create data file surface feature recognize particular phenomenon 
would point one thing figure big spike show schematically represent road see scene 
the rest relative response field 
because data electrical form digitize put directly computer see figure grey scale printout one band scanner 
you see take particular field follow frequency frequency easily see several change tone summarize computer print refer spectral signature field 
would add spectral signature actually relative response function wavelength 
some research consider do 
figure illustrate simple terrain map make data remote sensor 
high success almost kind terrain could say close operational feature classification algorithm 
green vegetation bare soil water make many mistake 
and kind map go produce data first satellite 
course produce three element vegetation soil water computer print one wish 
much research effort business specie identification show figure extensive experimentation spacecraft kind recognition map identify different specie 
right side figure see wheat print flight line 
more recently recognition map make different form illustrate figure show specie identification per data point recognition basis 
figure show data per field basis algorithm take 
agricultural field literal sense also data field basis 
both kind algorithms however available 
this type printout important one attempt something yield error field corn example indeed corn either suffer form stress scanner see soil instead corn drought condition weed occur scanner recognize corn 
now want know acreage measurement need per field classifier work want boundary field 
when talk yield recognition need per data classifier scheme want know individual point basis computer classify resolution element 
one thing would like say leave want know acreage easy 
you altitude aircraft spacecraft speed scan rate mirror scan angle 
all thing combine give total field view instrument 
the resolution cell therefore dimension computer merely count resolution element 
once classifier say corn wheat beyond easy task many acre corn wheat simply count resolution element 
purdue also work soil soil map remote sense data 
the indiana state soil conservation service state conservationist indiana involve research 
munsell color chip use year compare soil color however automatic system work high data rate 
figure illustrate soil color map ask compare pattern see figure organic matter map soil quite highly correlated 
conventional map morgan county indiana boundary condition show scanner show figure 
the detail within boundary real verify ground 
this exciting part research compare data remote sensor modern soil survey course researcher encourage 
finally difficult target yellowstone national park complex multi faceted terrain illustrated figure 
the importance reason encourage ert feasibility type experiment 
one expect kind performance spacecraft 
you see erts band percent less correct best band 
the best band choose computer 
the computer capability review classification process internally remember best band classification task 
the thermal band try well see little confusion introduce thermal band surpising completely understood many people 
remember say temperature multiply emissivity temperature alone 
you consider emissivity look response scanner thermal band 
that get complex information terrain

interpretation aerial photograph land use classification ernest hardy center aerial photographic study cornell university ithaca new york the purpose talk morning provide background information concern kind land us interpret conventional aerial photograph 
confusion often develop understanding difference air photo interpretation photogrammetry 
air photo interpretation field use air photo source information human mind interpreting device 
comparison photogrammetry rely heavily mathematics triangulation use quite sophisticated machinery 
previously state print percent information useful agriculture ever extract ordinary black white aerial photograph 
although statement make several year ago yet anyone rebut way 
this mean actually time progressed although tremendous amount information available ordinary black white aerial photography yet find way exploit economically make use much presumably could 
photography line sight mean imaging item sophisticate many new type image equipment see 
provide inexpensive source information unbiased source information record know point time 
also excellent archival quality 
keep long period time refer often necessary 
develop photo interpretation approach land use inventory one first step always look need user information 
what want get imagery corollary question how much money afford spend 
the next step find trade point get information satisfactory user amount money available 
reality extreme detail people want spend enough money 
hand get tremendous amount output low cost information use rather coarse pattern 
another consideration quality experience interpreter go use job 
heard great number paper sure kind background photo interpreter essential 
practice find 
wide variety background seem best answer question 
background economics may contribute knowledge background provide young man background history may point view one agronomy forestry would 
therefore restrict one area expertise air photo interpreter 
there three way consider level application interpretation 
one common use air photo interpretation mean identifying thing 
simply look photo great deal mono coverage well stereo coverage 
for example locate bridge farm house cottage 
measure thing way say big something whether large small proportion item type 
this actually common use air photo imagery 
the second level application interpretation 
this less widely use previous level 
case would look bridge determine size something importance 
what kind road serve connect two major city minor city farmland one side stream consideration 
look cemetery quite obvious new old one tell whether cemetery grow 
third level interpretation inference level 
here actually measure directly air photo imagery take information see direct process brain draw conclusion 
let back bridge 
from inferential approach geologist would see lot location bridge would 
transportation engineer would see differently geologist economist would see something different either party 
cemetery get large town everybody leave sociologist would infer increase size cemetery indication population either grow get old die quite rapidly 
these inferential application beyond anything mean direct interpretation automatic processing 
another favorite topic speaker convention question scale 
many paper give topic come final result conclude logically scale demand depends upon use want make information 
the future hold great deal new experience term scale recognition 
the standard scale rely provide department agriculture inventory far depend ratio 
another ratio commonly use tax mapping city planner forester 
another one like use wtyen get heavily urbanized area 
these straight line subdivision ratio 
what minor thing see ratio 
quite easy see white stripe road 
they four five inch wide 
you see thing little round light along airport runway eight inch diameter 
difficult get level recognition small item area scale imagery 
want much great detail forestry researcher canada find way detect image brush wooded area determine fire potential landscape 
they fastline equipment give rapid recognition one inch 
would like contrast kind scale recognition work able recently 
paper prepare department agriculture information bulletin 
print available report project try exhaust capability recognition various pattern landscape different scale 
think term negative earth ratio able approach scale lose recognition usable information 
think satellite go able much good mean go one extreme 
least know something one parameter try work 
work take number different kind commerically available film try number exposure process camera equipment try exhaust capability factor involve develop print 
the capability level enlarge equipment first thing fail 
well enlarge equipment become available ratio may exceed 
practically case however say user exhaust capability scale imagery choose 
for imagery able classify land seven class use 
think could improve upon future 
the new high altitude photography excellent 
although still work mostly ratios high altitude aircraft provide imagery ratios excellent negative production allow excellent enlargement process 
these available near future 
argument best kind film use logical answer search one provide best information need user 
the common one broad spectrum panchromatic black white film 
there addition infrared film infrared color various kind color film 
present find films create limitation image recognition interpretation 
much apt difficulty term enlargement quality imagery enlargement procesu 
there many thing try use regular air photo 
for example great many photograph fly may june july august september see 
case unique characteristic determine unique situation 
one illustration would determination difference seasonal residence versus year round residences along lake front 
but equipment available imagination do fly lake front morning first major snowstorm 
everyone get work shovel driveway least make car track yard 
you know many house live year round basis 
actually work land use information readily available late season air photo 
the reason activity land summer month create large number signature recognize characteristic certain kind land use 
these include dust pattern kick machinery use recreational use evident late season 
think park area ground seem literally beatten death 
this show well air photo even determine degree much activity carry area 
but get kind information photography fly early spring runoff snow cover essentially washed characteristic like work 
there another major point must concern outselves extraction information air photo 
the kind classification want talk need consider term user people demand information 
consider variety demand make information user interest amount money spend size unit want map 
also addition three basic way measure thing air photo one time span 
the first one area measurement quite commonly use 
the second one commonly use point information exact location something 
the third one quite obvious linear measurement length various item format 
currently work do field base manual operation 
there many research effort underway retrieve kind information use automate process 
success already case close 
major problem concept develop time 
the classification land use commonly generate term need information particular classification system 
tend take exist classification system turn remote sensor ask much give 
make rapid progress take reverse approach 
ask information land use gotten air photo example rather design first comprehensive complete land use classification go air photo find much information provide 
land use classification give several hundred item information generate air photo 
new york state land use inventory item derive air photo interpretation 
design inventory system provide well item information land use derive air photo interpretation 
contrast test familiar standard land use cod system derive kind information 
when compare amount information could get air photo standard land use system find sixty seven category system digit level two identify air photo 
digit level three category identify air photo digit level four category identify air photo 
that still large amount information 
obviously would appropriate develop classification look first information available photo relies earth source supplemental information 
develop land use category land use classification system new york state project progress througjh number step develop interpretation process 
easy one large group interpreter make decision difficult make agree decision 
however adequate training supervision accomplish 
able classify area square mile period two year total man year time effort involve 
the big difference approach use lot manpower 
the major difference inexpensive operation 
job per square mile 
back literature hand conference comparison four different land use classification scheme new york state inventory system right hand column 
use point area measurement anderson indicate large number classification unit kind land use 
these exhaustive could break subdivision beyond 
for example orchard could well break identify dwarf apple tree semi dwarf standard tree high quality poor quality orchard 
however would time consume would cost 
the people interested agricultural land say would accept good inventory orchard worry sub divide class later 
essentially pattern could develop almost item listed land use category 
determine quality characteristic difficult task straightforward identification measurement 
housing category area measurement use could qualify kind housing look density level housing whether good section city old section improve deteriorate section etc 
major category break great number sub category 
these aggregate indicate total landscape 
the detail obtain manner great 
decision process use area acre 
essentially every acre land state look mapped information record detail 
there area use exploit extent could undertake use regular air photo 
one major one interested tax mapping 
tax mapping land use closely associate would like heartily recommend consider tax mapping major feature discussion conference 
city regional planning another area make great use air photo interpretation 
would never propose one inventory go provide answer information need various kind agency planner interest 
improve exist inventory technique 
without criticise population census easy task assign population township much accurately aggregate total whole town 
use air photo assign number people house determine house township 
you may large area town population density small area high population density 
with today environmental concern kind information much significant plan resource management simple knowledge total number people town 
there major need air photo interpretation local government activity especially development program area land management 
not everything do air photo appropriate point least two three thing possible 
one cannot identify ownership 
there case quite obvious major airport own government unit possible say certain parcel land neighbor own another one 
the use certain crop different kind purpose also cannot identify 
corn raise area part production use corn oil porduction another part livestock feed determine air photo decision owner crop go make regard use 
this partial summary use conventional aerial photograph land use classification 
many inventory carry manner process although slow desire use enough consider test approach 
geo information system and the use computer handle land use information tomlinson chairman commission geographical data sense process international geographical union the initial step understand computer use handle land use information appreciate normal facility computer bring handle practically kind data equally well apply data describe use land

appropriate report remotely sensed land use data area even also useful ground truth change detection control 
tract data also assemble functional urban area without regard political division 
land use class washington prototype show right 
there two nest group urban non urban 
these expand contract meet operational constraint 
land use change obviously take place annotate without wait detect later imagery 
the land use classification scheme use base primarily visible land use knowledge land ownership 
this make system sensitive observable change one example classification dilemma confront prospective user data remote sensor 
the planner example might tempt use remote sense current land use information probably already operationally dependent land ownership record classify land use 
this problem insurmountable need 
one way deal problem other closely related expect classification scheme serve likely need without modification 
useranalyst add another mosaic overlay equivalent computerize data format explain land use interpretation introduce data source 
most deficiency basic land use classification scheme intend multiple us remedied way 
example next page atlas show figure

after land use interpret urban area delimit 
that definition urban non urban actually do land use interpretation 
the procedure seek define give area comparable urban real estate different time different urban area give time 
within area delimit match census data land use data try recognize classify intra urban environment 
with building block hope construct model ass change environmental quality 
after land use map measure data prepare computer storage retrieval 
show figure example experimental computer land use map one census tract 
this work boston test site geographer dartmouth college contract geographic application program geological survey 
each digit display represent

similar map would make land use 
then could instruct computer print cell cell tract tract analysis change 
this would tell look evidence change erts imagery 
other parameter could also map computer 
san francisco bay test site example urgent need know location amount residential land use young bay mud 
this formation characterize unstable slope certain hydrological condition 
this computer map may seem sophisticated technical information illustrate area data graphic non graphic source enter common information system 
also illustrate one form end product 
the system grid atlas page make possible 
the page also serve place record change describe location useful environmental context 
also provide user place attack operational problem whether remote sense contribute solution 
some thought change detection change detection earlier application part remote sense represent conventional air photo interpretation 
then part call damage assessment military operation implies pre event inventory well post event analysis change 
there similar application assess sudden environmental change result fire flood earthquake civil disorder civil defense 
there similar application gradual change result day day constructive destructive ecological process include pollution land water air resource 
there two noteworthy exist system detect change urban regional environment one use remote sense 
the first census tract statistical area comparable census data report successive census 
the modern minute topographic map publish geological survey show magenta overprint select planimetric addition mostly work man present early edition conventional class feature show traditional ink color 
the basis new map information interpretation recent aerial photography one form remote sense 
any comprehensive system urban change detection ought provide basic ness ness ness census tract magenta map overprint 
this census city project atlas urban regional change attempt include basic 
pre event inventory 
the experiment also exploit change detection attribute remote sense analysis interpretation change 
eventually advance image interpretation technology may provide automate short cut somewhat primitive interpretive operation use develop prototype 
mechanic urban change detection census city experiment concern directly involve land use classification scheme 
one approach test involves category separate areal difference identify 
these category arrange order decrease intensity roughly livelihood residential 
modest scale generalization consider class range respectively specialized structure singleness use least specialized multipurposeful use 
change possibility matrix construct list land use class order horizontally vertically 
each cell matrix represent possible change include change pairs agriculture industry industry agriculture 
these possibility group three class likely less likely least likely 
letter code assign change use identify location mosaic overlay change detect 
this code also use computerized form information 
this suggest propose deal kind change 
for cell along diagonal matrix pair identical change kind indicate 
however change intensity may detect 
numerical code would assign record overlay 
code would omit 
code etc would record overlay location magnitude increase intensity detect 
code even zero would indicate magnitude decrease intensity 
another code would assign represent detect error earlier classification 
such observation would correct data base without introduce bias analysis interpretation change 
weight would assign value judgment project new population estimate environmental impact systematic ecological process update data base subject 
opportunity comparative urban analysis remote sense operational program context one model urban area illustrate graphically figure 
express relationship total land use area size vertical axis population size horizontal axis 
each dot represent one urban area 
each triangle represent one urban test site 
from operational experience acquire model might use compare urban area describe system city even project estimate cost analytical operation urban area

the second part problem encounter dueker system relationship 
here take issue premise conference state must consider need user cannot work detailed system satisfy everyone 
dueker think independently decide upon land use classification detail 
this inter dependent decision important system variable land data system spatial unit grid size land use classification detail decide together 
otherwise fall trap detailed land use classification scheme large area 
from dueker perspective combination meet many user requirement 
two important system variable point source data imagery scale area type whether urban rural non use desert example 
presently work develop relationship variable check consistency term system designer decision area check make sure consistent decision 
john est university california santa barbara suggest list user agency need obtain remote sense would helpful 
robert keith university oregon work land use classification system believe basic size cell depend store data 
think unrealistic insist entire country one system 
for example might want data one system develop transportation system different system study 
the need data agricultural area completely different would need urban area insist identical realistic 
the system compatible within agency data interchangeable workable system 
george mcgimsey american institute planner regional planning council baltimore maryland assert planner cannot afford collect data therefore mercy collect data 
planner however data collection business 
need think new type plan come law enforcement criminal justice plan comprehensive health plan manpower planning 
most data work past metropolitan local level data could take data system develop solve major national problem 
they really urban data system 
think planner probably get lot mileage remote sense technology development urban data system 
place high priority development geographic base file tie remote sense 
however need beyond classification system past 
lot classification system orient toward economic activity particularly agriculture activity represent standard industrial classification code 
need think term classification system service grow section economy particularly government 
classification system governmental activity 
this require lot hard thinking 
regard high cost collect data mcgimsey point look end run 
how build information system without bury data orgy gobble time analytical work 
think remote sense may end run use creatively 
albert guttenberg american institute planner state must determine remote sense tell 
what give term need know accommodate various interest need 
appear three side conference 
the first concerned standardization land use classification second capacity remote sense pick usable information third relationship two 
this relationship guttenberg considers especially critical 
propose expert field remote sense get together person various interest land data 
thought meeting series meeting work level careful appraisal make much inferential direct information obtain remote sense 
anderson ask ronald shelton go get user indicate data need new york study 
shelton indicate use three way analysis 
first look could get black white photography take april use 
then check compatibility handle classification certain land use computer process need land use data expressible quantitative form output computer 
thirdly classification scheme comprehensive since square mile survey 
joseph sizer minnesota state planning agency present information minnesota land management information system 
current land use one several characteristic land include system 
approximately square mile land survey 
interpretation aerial photo use main approach obtain land use data

hope data finally available user format consistently useful 
olaf 01son watershed management forest service state forest service presently plan three time frame category national forest 
one long range planning less concerned resource allocation 
this look ahead year 
the short term time frame specific timber sale area specific haul area 
the third frame use project design 
the forest service make resource inventory would serve three purpose work particularly short term plan year planning span 
they work scale inch mile 
ben spada forest service discuss forest inventory united state 
point addition inventory carry million acre national forest forest service also responsible conduct inventory forest land united state 
national sampling system operate seven regional center forest service use 
this system uniform design uniform informational output 
more detailed mapping forest resource formerly use abandon high cost 
inventory forest service much concern change forest use take place 
richard ginn tennessee valley authority indicate within tva wide variety use land use information 
ginn work program level regional local state agency 
assure compatibility various program numerous agency operate within county area tva major need must careful continue attention

this session close chairman indicate major problem land use scheme urbanization 
also indicate group meet wednesday morning june 
point especially topic list question discussion distribute 
administration public work program and land use information need session june william johnson soil conservation service chairman robert alexander usgs geographic application program reporter roger tomlinson igu commission data sense process technical advisor 
johnson open session introduce alexander tomlinson william fischer manager eros program department interior 
ask present identify agency 
johnson distribute copy list question pertain major objective conference 
review question list ask comment participant 
how need federal agency meet date overview land use throughout country basis uniform date scale categorization first second order level 
how utilize best feature exist widely use classification scheme 
how best devise open end classification permit development third fourth digit level still compatibility national system classification 
what classification framework receptive data instrument satellite high altitude aircraft platform 
wesley smith tennessee valley authority say tva recently complete study change land use tva area base data conservation need inventory 
they particularly interest determine kind land go change status use make land 
felt one important thing need agency able identify term agriculture also term urban requirement various physiographic class land 
they need information order make decision concern thing housing development recreation area etc 
another problem differentiate farm land state park recreational area 
although use census record aid interpretation data feel still need 
data ownership land 
smith propose first category draft land use classification urban other related us expand include detail 
mention particular transportation network 
johnson point however mention anderson earlier today put two unlike thing category lower valid interpretation potential 
also ownership normally part land use classification system although johnson agree certainly important attribute land 
comment however seem strong tendency today devise functional classification rather morphological one reflect present active land use farm land graze highway residential etc 
johnson ask smith tva actually need monitoring system would give rapid date information land use change 
smith agree 
case johnson say classification scheme propose conference one use many federal agency obtain basic land use data high altitude aircraft satellite overflight rapid date basis 
such classification would provide comparable data nationwide basis first second level give individual agency freedom expand scheme accord need 
smith comment tva find department agriculture conservation need inventory classification scheme useful ask johnson would possible acquire information potential use land 
johnson explain soil conservation service presently work publication contain information soil series type presently include conservation need inventory 
such information provide data potential productivity soil limitation use housing highway recreation etc 
holtan agricultural research service comment work concern hydrologic research 
report international hydrologic decade sixth year close estimate water world 
one category contain estimate soil moisture reliant upon knowledge land use soil etc 
they find land capability important factor determine hydrologic computation 
holtan say urban hydrologic study felt would useful could get breakdown land use residential industrial etc us affect hydrologic computation 
william fischer eros program manager ask actually need need measure impervious surface urban area 
holtan respond number thing affect figure hydrologic measurement might well entirely different industrial area residential area 
fischer comment illustrated problem find make decision method data process information extraction 
example show 
high altitude aircraft photo parking lot area extract suggest although information could value might riot strictly consider land use data 
johnson say however indeed land use information demonstrate function land 
fischer mention anderson suggest plenary session conference surrogate might use interpret land use data fischer ask classification scheme reflect surrogate 
perhaps suggest alternate categorization mean one could interpret one way second different way include scheme 
george ornlng university minnesota mention state information system project try integrate well log data collect regular basis usgs soil information 
data could integrate cod might present complete hydrologic overview area potential land us 
this discuss briefly fischer orning tomlinson agreement data would valuable could successfully obtain 
johnson refer list question previously distribute begin session ask what kind land use data need 
what key category 
edward hanses corps engineer say work environmental resource section plan branch prepare master plan reservoir area vegetation management area etc 
say would like get land use capability data well data land use change 
field hydrology han say plan reservoir land reclamation flood control project need know land capability 
general need information aid planning good water management area 
harold rib federal highway administration comment felt two way approach land use classification map map interpret break category 
rib felt interpretation land use continue beyond classification 
tomlinson say however ability analyze interpret data depend identification categorization 
one problem interpretation fischer comment learn interpret certain thing prior knowledge area similar area 
there follow short discussion problem analyze interpret data urban hydrologic us 
orning comment work minnesota use basic nine category land use classification system 
for example state own land minnesota standardize computerize well federally own land 
felt basic classification scheme could use combine 
information various agency 
for example say could combine forest service data minnesota state information 
orning felt standardization record data keep various agency one important step rapidly obtain valid date information particular area 
the information extract computerized minnesota automatically update 
state level orning say integrate computerized lot different data use solve many land use problem 
suggest centralized computer data bank compatible state regional data bank might extremely useful many planner administrator 
johnson continue another question how rationally relate first order classification category second level category 
andersen scheme standard land use cod manual fact four land use classification scheme present conference background material one multi category system various level must relate 
han comment basic problem category interested potential land use present use illustrate classification scheme 
johnson respond interested problem identify potential us however still extremely necessary achieve agreement categorization present land use basis identify future potential us 
how shall land classified shall present scale 
these question must restrict meeting 
wesley smith ask standard land use cod manual general use 
johnson respond several agency scs use example department transportation 
smith felt category restrict used national basis ultimate use land important factor reflect classification scheme 
tom1inson say perhaps define exactly purpose conference discussion 
canada say developed five different type map canada land inventory area four map type portray land suitability certain category use fifth show present land use 
present land use topic concern conference 
agency interested furthering knowledge present land use type information need 
james brittenham arizona highway department say due large amount data become available high altitude satellite coverage arizona find real problem put data effective use 
another problem get current information land use change land ownership 
brittenham comment although information need great feel offer suggestion regard land use category 
say would like listen learn subject 
edward davis bureau outdoor recreation say break information two category one prospective user recreational area area potential recreational value 
johnson ask davis scheme consideration meeting would value work 
davis comment familiar standard land use cod manual work use basic information represent first two level land use classification 
johnson comment classification scheme properly design could divide many subcategories sub level necessary user even assign ownership particular plot land 
warren myers agricultural stabilization conservation service say basically needs fall generally two group 
the first general planning purpose second need detail concern requirement various state order apply federal aid proper area 
myers felt need much detail information possible obtain 
comment interested land use classification agricultural stabilization conservation service currently consider expansion computer system would important land use data might make compatible computerized data system 
felt definite need coordinate system collect interpret file retrieve land use data agency 
robert krebill iowa office planning programming say office use land use information type planning work currently engage 
they however try design state wide information system compatible 
krebill felt definite need land use information particularly economic development environmental impact study area iowa 
also mention necessity interfacing land use classification information system type information system 
review tentative classification first two level propose anderson johnson say one problem interpretation use scheme everything must assign either one category 
this usually lead catch type category ask comment problem 
good way deal miscellaneous item may fall easily category 
tomlinson comment canadian present land use survey classification simple use term unproductive land catch category 
idle land use moment might put rangeland 
tomlinson say however even 
simple classification scheme use canada still acquire enormous number piece land use information scale portrayed 
refer propose present land use survey united state emphasize first second level category might well intend use data high altitude satellite overflight portray national level 
these data would serve basic reference could refine region statewide local level agency concern 
ask however represent today interested know item arable land locate 
major urban area locate 
these example basic land use data identify categorized national level 
they however refine state regional local agency fit individual need 
johnson agree precisely point 
johnson say example nationwide information inventory soil conservation service conservation need inventory first compile subsequently update 
this inventory base expansion data specific soil sample randomly choose either already map soil survey program map especially inventory 
these data include type soil topography slope gradient etc include soil survey use clearly indicate 
then use local experience judgment need lands management treatment order protect enhance resource spell 
land use identification one part data important part 
johnson review land use category present classification scheme prepare anderson association american geographer ask comment concern category list 
there short discussion use arable term seem imply land suitable cultivation although might include rangeland etc 
hoitan comment hop particular scale would decide upon use constantly thereafter 
say scale might dictate information need would turn influence category 
johnson agree need agency would dictate scale information would portray however even reasonably large scale canada land inventory possible include enormous amount detail 
there short discussion question scale relation interpretation portrayal data 
continue discussion aag classification scheme johnson ask would sufficient know whether forest land use commercially non commercially 
smith tva say agency need ave information 
they want know forest type soft hardwood etc 
johnson remind 
group discuss first second level category data national level data expand sub divide include detail mention smith 
ronald becker office sea grant development louisiana state university comment none land use classification scheme present conference really fill need data coastal zone constitute one third land louisiana 
mention particular problem identification classification wetlands shellfish ground marine fishery etc 
cover far see present category 
another problem area identify categorize land area change loss land dredge subsidence channel etc 
some water area rapidly fill land area deplete 
johnson comment standard land use cod system category resource production extraction include along agricultural activity breakdown fish activity relate service second digit level 
this could subdivide even individual agency include vertibrate invertibrate fish well industry marshland area fur production 
aag scheme water use activity low activity area marshland orient might include activity 
they might also include resource production extraction 
becker object include thing low activity area region often use intensively 
there discussion change regularly take place among water wetland dry land border area particular area categorize land use scheme 
johnson say water area least territorial limit include land area first level 
however refine need include specific category higher level 
tomlinson comment many country similar land use classification problem 
for example country reclaim water area japan must classify rice paddy water much year 
johnson request donald van skiver usgs topographic division explain interest land use classification scheme 
say map revision program presently use four category land urban suburban rural remote wilderness 
each category different revision cycle every five year urban suburban every year rural every year remote wilderness 
they would like able identify land area change one category another could rapidly update 
johnson ask would interested map scale eight ten category first level could rapidly 
update use high altitude aircraft satellite data 
van skiver agree map would helpful work 
robert alexander reporter session say would like comment several point possible interest group 
one hand say see agency requirement tend lead detail classification scheme however potentially tremendous data handle problem even basic category 
alexander ask whether agency require lot detailed category land use classification might also help information contain first second level 
also comment much discussion session tend focus agricultural land us schedule discuss another session conference 
ask representative present session would classify public work administrator would identify category land use useful work 
number participant today state primarily attend session learn land use classification rather contribute suggestion commentst 
james simpson national park service say park service would interest first level land use category 
felt agency would benefit information much agency 
strapson say need know general development information even outside national park area development would naturally affect planning 
example general development mention housing development oil exploration coastal water water use need area border everglades affect actual potential national park 
simpson say would like included major category category would delineate natural ecologically balance area 
comment park service often use area badlands white sand national park national monument although would probably include land use classification category unproductive land 
conclusion simpson comment agency park service concern federal land recreation management reclamation project must broad comprehensive information order develop background environmental impact statement project 
johnson ask han corps engineer wish comment simpson remark 
han say agree wholeheartedly simpson 
say however although basic first two level land use clasifteation scheme intend reflect current land use feel potential alternative land use important 
such information may easily reflect land use classification scheme 
han say agency consider many alternative us 
land area prepare environmental impact statement propose project 
example area might classify forest land might also used timber production could time wildlife refuge well use recreational purpose 
case land use category area place 
johnson respond show multiple us land map problem one classification 
illustrate area map could do multiple use category variety symbol 
however johnson say decide upon first second level land use classification scheme category possible 
way national agreement category reach make useful majority agency 
below level category sub divide necessary individual agency 
george orning university minnesota comment felt category entitle unproductive land open different interpretation accord orientation agency 
suggest substitute open land barren land 
krebbil iowa office planning programming say felt could speak present today say federal agency would agree upon first second level land use classification scheme sub level could decide upon individual user 
johnson close session comment indeed interesting informative meeting thank contribution 
property evaluation and tax assessment and land use information need session june arch gerlach 
geological survey chairman john place reporter 
several main theme explore session 
gerlach open session read suggestion letter marion clawson resource future 
one suggestion contact robert cook university cincinnati school law work american bar association establish standard tax mapping 
cook present session speak need standardize land scale land use mapping 
mention example map do prince edward island canada scale use add scale large would even useful 
several session participant express desire federal government take lead develop national standard 
marvin scher usgs topographic division state geological survey normally undertake large scale map urban area however know nothing prevent survey participation establishing standard 
robert kitchell new york state board equalization report state completing tax map detail fifty foot would willing make standard available capt 
baker make similar offer regarding standard national ocean survey 
leslie katz city new york report tax map borough prepare would make available building use classification 
refer group dual independent map encode dime system use bureau censius 
john rackhara district columbia government report need continue census inventory property statistical analysis 
each parcel presently record land use code graphic coordinate 
gerlach ask mapping step bypass 
rackham respond map mostly bureau public road use base plot pareel boundary overlay 
they use hud coding system scale inch foot 
kenneth fisher american bar foundation report get group specialist together come january hopefully settle common coordinate system 
heard conversion utm system coordinate system time consume 
several attendee reply exist computer program could make conversion quickly 
thomas payne tompkins county assessor office ithaca new york explain without land use map appraisal tax assessment purpose difficult map could utilize either block parcel system point centroid system 
big problem processing data automatic digitizer might prohibitively expensive 
gerlach describe sensor system aboard nasa 57f aircraft film filter combination use nasa flight program 
ask value survey would tax assessor 
william mitchell usgs geographic application program report briefly successful use high altitude aircraft photography create land use map 
mile surround san francisco bay george skrubb oakland county michigan plan commission support conclusion basis land use map experience organization 
ernest hardy cornell university report state florida planning rely photogrammetric survey place field survey map 
also point assessor need redundancy build help explain public assessment generate 
john rackham agree something visibly meaningful need 
thomas payne felt trend land use one decade another never adequately document 
marvin scher report large scale orthophoto map would another tool assessor 
later show example orthophoto map 
skrubb report pontiac michigan set orthophotos updated low altitude photograph yearly basis 
the base map scale 
standard data card space five different land use classification room expansion international code 
skrubb also point need good classification idle land 
raleigh barlowe michigan state university suggest remote sense technique might apply effectively group family city test concept central place theory 
kenneth dueker university iowa agree satellite photography would much useful comparative analysis large area detail seek metropolitan planner 
wray usgs geographic application program point land use classification term institutional educational etc 
little value land use determine see photography 
conclusion gerlach comment tax assessor apparently need land use map clear accurate property boundary must unit control well point control 
also apparent disagreement optimum grid system 
national international data bank land use map utm grid suitable 
session june arch gerlach geological survey chairman john place usgs reporter session 
the chairman open session call attention participant usgs circular entitle sensor detection capability study john wilson 
this publication describe capability various remote sensor could use aboard spacecraft aircraft detect common primarily man make feature earth surface 
the supply circular almost exhaust still may possible obtain copy gerlach office 
order focus attention urban land use classification information processing james wray usgs geographic application program ask describe urban change detection program developing 
the text wray presentation include set conference paper 
farnsworth southern california regional information study ask cost program like would 
this program great deal potential supplement exist survey 
how much would photograph cost purchase 
gerlach respond cost yet computered 
the photograph still experimental use use many investigator connect nasa earth resource program soon become available public nominal cost eros data center establish sioux fall south dakota 
wray comment boston land use map cost per square mile 
netherton interior department bureau outdoor recreation ask shape format would product 
what planner get per square mile 
wray respond example would manuscript map boston show board 
this example scale map do scale image cost approximately per square mile 
netherton comment would like determine additional refinement data planner would need get useful end product 
will moore dept 
transportation federal highway administration say highway development plan step 
necessary involves study population employment land use zone automobile ownership 
regard land use classification recommend standard land use cod manual 
also issue bulletin january digest data requirement transportation planning 
jacob silver census bureau comment two dimensional 
how general land use end 
can residential broken measure square foot 
intensity use third dimension measure 
wray respond remote sense provide base information treat area allow frequent examination 
time series synoptic view could supplementary exist census program 
for example paul watt association bay area government abac san francisco want survey land use census tract order measure transportation traffic flow 
county planner also need map potential growth usability land 
hart tri state planning commission mention i960 hud make plan grant available 
many regional plan group form land use information file 
suggest check exist file 
the tri state commission new york city prepared plan growth 
ernest hardy cornell university state soil map make photo help provide land use suitability information 
afternoon session gerlach open afternoon session invitation discussion participant 
reference hardy comment morning session 
james lyon bureau outdoor recreation state look information system new york state type one man office get technical advice regard use information system type 
hardy respond cornell university system category consider shopping list 
one person want 
the new york state system produce hundred thousand combination data easy specify want 
the form query specific data almost plain english 
william hart add trl state planning commission similar data bank use different system 
they theshelf item data book nine major land use category every square mile 
the broad category enough start planner computer detail 
hardy explain pay one format querying 
hi program use five format two computer generate 
these five 
data book square kilometer state include actual measurement detail 
overlay map show point data 
overlay map show area information 
data list computer page format 
planmap cell cell configuration map form generate line printer 
captain baker national ocean survey state participant appear come wealthy progressive area 
what poorer district 
who set data center pay maintain 
will every state maintain one center one 
gerlach respond ted paludin nasa marshall spaceflight center huntsville investigate problem help poorer district 
some act go congress right could possibly aid solution 
perhaps national science foundation federal agency organization could help 
robert cook university cincinnati state need common sense cooperation money 
important need get together make agreement 
ohio county could afford money information system need system tie county indiana kentucky well 
gerlach repeat emphasis second part capt 
baker question how many data bank state 
raleigh barlowe michigan state university comment land use statistic use wide variety purpose 
this include academic study 
statistical analysis land use tie areal basis rural urban 
regard question should one data bank one 
say several bank use different system data less likely comparable one cannot valid statistical analysis 
barlowe go ask wray find problem classification scheme 
wray answer comparability data big problem 
this experiment comparttive urban analysis 
several hundred square mile complete use scheme 
for example want boston way washington 
great care take define urban 
the graphic show hasen upon census city boundary 
concern comparability underlies research 
wray comment must learn define urban rural way use 
wray ask year aerial photography flown new york state survey would update 
hardy answer photography fly april group hop update survey least every ten year often every two five year select area 
they expect percent change land use 
stephen fregger florida department transportation state regard captain baker question shortage money rather administrative ability coordinate work 
florida try coordinate county impossible get agreement standard 
however department proceed develop best new file land use state make easily available 
there follow short discussion zone rezoning related transportation flow 
trip generation rate appear primary measure transportation present 
major problem tie transportation land use 
large area transportation study report take long produce thus could provide timely information need 
most data need report socio economic 
william hart comment must prepare mathematics special study coordinate system irregularly shaped object 
barlowe ask whether english measure metric measure system use 
gerlach respond nasa interior department eros program attempt convert metric system 
this seem direction show ask disagreement 
there comment question 
gerlach ask group reaction land use classification scheme present james wray 
richard ginn tennessee valley authority ask flight altitude type camera film use gathering data wray program 
wray respond overflight make select census city date fly foot foot 
from camera scale photography foot foot 
standard scale use research process 
the satellite photograph take altitude mile 
ginn comment tract boundary recognize bureau census appear change 
wray explain move may split tract may divide two part 
kenneth dueker university iowa felt trip generation relate directly land us 
the field transportation study successful relating service land use use network planning process 
however land use classification scheme use wray may entirely suitable transportation study 
also dueker felt would favor metric system midwest statistical data tie township section line 
cook comment linear distance convert mathematically computer 
the canadian issue white paper recommend change metric system 
response inquiry classification system wray maintain type land use appear urban non urban area 
also believe planner work system bias 
for example parcel data record tend ignore non privately own land 
richard ginn point consider open land surround airport use transportation 
wray describe method recording change 
anything transition record status 
square matrix might develop represent change one categories one category 
two digit code might use indicate point matrix change 
barlowe felt category open space must break meaningful 
other felt way transportation category 
wray agree transportation one several category need source information supplement photo source 
hardy state must learn combine data contrast biologist example need break information finer finer detail 
also need waste basket subcategory every unit put thing quite fit 
however big problem get individual investigator agree definition 
gerlach direct attention group subject cluster city study individual city particular problem delimit urban area 
hart comment tri state commission method cluster square mile predominantly urbanized area 
they must contiguous sufficiently high intensity use 
barlowe report michigan census data use township people less percent land crop consider urban 
however new technique remote sense refine method measurement might develop 
gerlach hardy wray agree method delimit urban area use meet vary need 
with computerized technique quite feasible use 
gerlach ask participant whether group federal agency try draw guideline could use local government organization stick 
order get national view urbanization hop conference could help develop method handle urban data 
have accomplish 
important federal level 
cook point several federal agency corps engineer department transportation interested large scale map 
dueker felt interested user need national state local level 
local need however aggregate national need 
that four digit code collapsible fine level gross level classification 
gerlach emphasize entire conference mean open end 
hop participant consider conference finish return home hope continue hear problem 
several conference document mail participant list participant set invited paper give open session soon become available 
addition steer committee conference try summarize seven discussion session summary issue proceeding conference 
however mean complete task session 
the session close request james wray help thinking monitor quality environment 
perhaps first difine environment 
what role remote sense play monitoring environment 
agriculture and natural resource and land use information need session june william johnson soil conservation service chairman robert alexander reporter ger tpmlinson technical advisor 
johnson open session remind present anderson point early conference national land use classification scheme 
satisfy need federal agency date overview land use throughout country basis uniform date scale categorization first second digit level 
utilize best feature exist widely use classification scheme 
provide open end classification system enable regional state local agency develop detailed land use classification scheme third fourth digit level meet particular need still compatible national system 
receptive data instrument satellite high altitude aircraft platform 
invited participant express view concern classification scheme present anderson paper conference plenary session comment wish propose national land use classification system 
johnson also ask four different land use classification scheme present conference background material would suit need present 
neil stout bureau outdoor recreation comment felt canadian scheme outdoor recreation place best category 
wesley smith tva comment found hard compare category different land use classification scheme 
present conference background material 
johnson illustrate blackboard first second third level category agriculture association american geographer scheme 
grain crop 
small grain 
coarse graimi 
root crop 
fiber crop 
anderson describe process use classification scheme develop aag 
george nez federation rocky mountain state denver comment scheme discussion seem develop primarily use remote sense data 
however continue many land us easily determine remote sense felt scheme also reflect 
nez mention many data need city regional planner must obtain source remote sense 
felt would impossible select one particular land use classification scheme fit need 
illustration mention new york state scheme use eight nine first level category break second level three type urban land use two type rural land use two type public land use etc 
use scheme felt lot improvisation would necessary 
suggest remote sense data high altitude aircraft satellite overflight interpret computerized user make available central source data bank 
johnson thank nez comment ask anyone would like comment question 
robert alexander report least two center dissemination remote sense data user although interpretation do user 
these nasa goddard space flight center greenbelt 
primary distribution department interior eros data center locate sioux fall south dakota general distribution public 
alexander comment agreement broad first second level category would aid tremendously make remote sense land use data available user nationally compatible acceptable format 
johnson agree concensus basic land use classification category important step make high altitude aircraft satellite data valuable wider variety user 
george orning university minnesota comment work classify state land use find necessary gather data either otherwise available compatible data already acquire 
hoitan agricultural research service comment amount detail land use classification scheme bother perhaps participant 
hand sherman mining agricultural stabilization conservation service felt simple category include several different us primary level 
this would make interpretation difficult different agency 
suggest first two level classification scheme broaden 
while possible one land use include category johnson indicate multiple land us could note map type data issue public 
gene wunderlich national resource economic division department 
agriculture mention define land us classifica 
tion scheme face decide upon hierarchy 
anderson agree important point 
mention work state land information system 
university minnesota find problem 
explain minnesota land use classification system 
compile list many variable aid analysis 
joseph sizer minnesota state planning agency comment 
data geologic data supply potential well present land 
anderson agree current land use one aspect 
important one consider 
while discussion problem interest johnson say would take time conference resolve must return consideration land use category 
loyd young usgs conservation division comment need data repetitive historical order indicate trend 
edward fernald florida state university indicate felt important establish scale information give 
suggest conference decide upon scale classification level establish guide formula generalization category land use scheme 
johnson comment two type information consideration land use classification map geologic soils vegetation etc computerize data wide variety format 
these two source data course meet computerized data bank problem land use data bank yet operable may several year 
order achieve least national overview land use 
necessary reach agreement land use classification scheme first two level 
such agreement enable land use information uniformly interpret analyzed digitize retrieved computerize data bank 
orning fernald agree johnson national land use data system would useful uniformity land use classification system necessary prerequisite 
response question concern amount information may gather remote sense johnson say would depend amount money expend particular project 
remote sensor obtain data presently use analyzed 
tomlinson comment canada identify information aerial photography least six acre lot 
john est university california santa barbara comment resolution data depend mostly amount money expend obtain 
roger hoffer puedue university comment ert satellite due launch next year may get data resolution one acre 
johnson ask anything added aag classification scheme 
gloria mcgregor metropolitan council twin city area comment category idle land include standard land use cod manual aag scheme 
anderson respond put third fourth digit level classification rather broad first two level 
miss mcgregor ask would identify land area presently use 
olson forest service grover torbert bureau land management also ask public land 
anderson respond idle land public land could place category low activity 
sizer comment might problem identify land state planning purpose 
ronald becker office sea grant development lsu say first level classification perhaps consider land occupancy land activity 
anderson say would consider point data becker agree 
nez ask possibility get mix different type land use information central source 
olin bock forest service comment land use data bank contains basic national information would value work feel would necessarily include detailed information third fourth level 
govind sharma alabama university question need recreational use land include first level category well detailed sub category first level category aag scheme 
robert keith university oregon comment standardization land use classification certainly would helpful work field 
there general agreement among session participant concern need standardization 
johnson ask agency representative would interested map scale show eight nine major land use category 
richard alien dept 
agriculture statistical reporting service respond bureau would interest map sample information 
julius mai soil conservation service say information would quite valuable plan national program conservation resource environmental plan etc 
hoffer ask often map could update 
johnson respond could rapidly update use high altitude aircraft satellite data ease keep data current one really important point 
hoffer ask anderson include permanent seasonal snow cover classification category 
anderson reply probably would cover best high level scheme extensive permanent snow cover locate alaska 
nez say however snow cover important recreational factor 
johnson mention various agency keep track snow cover permanent snow cover quite limited 
joseph sizer say agree necessary reach agreement land use category need national level also point felt necessary agree size information unit need 
johnson adjourn session lunch say would consider aag classification system detail afternoon session 
johnson open afternoon session read category contain aag classification system 
ask comment category 
resource production extraction 
transportation communication utility 
urban activity 
town build livelihood area 
recreational activity 
low activity area 
water use activity 
robert douglas pennsylvania state university dept 
forestry question placement recreation separate category suggest include category resource 
johnson remark believe anderson intend category use function land 
douglas agree function land felt light morning discussion may different us pattern land area 
johnson agree many land area serve multiple us standardize classification system decision must make regard basic us 
tomlinson say canadian system use predominant use land classification 
douglas however felt recreation separate category might misinterpret 
john antenucci maryland department planning comment multiple us land could distinguish use computer cod 
george nez ask tomlinson consider seasonal variation decide upon predominant us land canada 
tomlinson respond detail way variation consider 
wesley smith question need separate category second level agriculture grazing land 
johnson reply scheme activity orient therefore agriculture implies farm 
grover torbert bureau land management suggest separate category wildlife include scheme 
olin bock forest service mention category fishing might include 
regard ronald becker comment industry shrimp oystering could include resource sub category could use mariculture category agriculture 
because difficulty interpret thing fish oyster bed remote sense data obtain satellite high altitude aircraft suggest included category water first second level 
tomlinson comment first second level category thing interpret high altitude satellite imagery third high level require prior knowledge 
information low altitude aircraft photo field check etc 
the detailed classification level expensive becomes use 
after discussion point agree category first two level classification restrict thing interpret high altitude satellite data third high level scheme would include information obtain low altitude aircraft photo field check data source 
ronald becker suggest second level category mine quarrying combine would hard distinguish 
anderson agree good point 
becker also mention possibility include pipeline category communication transportation 
population density particularly urban area also discuss possible inclusion high level scheme 
robert keith university oregon mention problem use census bureau definition urban area 
tomlinson comment canada land inventory use category build everything could interpret data 
anderson comment census bureau use term build 
therefore definition work 
suggest urban area build area define area uniformly interpret 
regard johnson comment understood census bureau entirely satisfied definition urban area 
continue consideration first level category johnson ask comment concern category recreation 
mention douglas already suggest eliminate separate category level put third fourth level classification 
wallace reed university virginia suggest define recreation level regard physical aspect land rather activity viewpoint 
anderson comment question return problem primary activity land 
olin bock suggest include unproductive land low activity category 
anderson say however might cause problem 
for example beach florida actually productive land neither low activity area 
olson comment canada land inventory defines low activity land support vegetation 
john est university california santa barbara comment lot sand dune area california use recreational activity 
suggest perhaps change terminology might take care problem 
johnson say hawaii almost barren lava area use housing raise certain crop 
reed comment perhaps mix economic activity physical characteristic either one must decide upon 
tomlinson comment present land use map canada land inventory do parallel four survey inventory reflect simply present us land 
after discussion problem agreement reach barren land preferable unproductive land 
after short recess johnson list follow category consideration 
farm grazing 
transportation communication 
low activity 
say could map united state show six classification land us could map taxonomically detailed six category 
would six land use category sufficient 
anderson felt farm grazing include category short discussion follow category propose 
urban built 
farm land 
grassland graze 
forest land 
low activity wetlands cold barren land 
transportation communication 
mine quarry extract us 
gloria mcgregor raise problem distinguish pasture rangeland 
johnson respond pasture improve land rangeland necessarily 
also say rangeland also public land 
anderson disagree however rangeland also public land 
antenucci ask agricultural area locate within urban area would categorize 
another problem might pose certain industry locate rural area 
ohnson respond data consider point rather area data category select reflect principal use land 
hoffer suggest combine urban industrial one category however object urban rural industrial area 
tpmlinson suggest problem take care build part category urban 
another question concern whether category forestry also include wooded vegetation johnson say 
there discussion term forestry suggest changed forest 
wesley smith ask federal park land would categorize johnson reply probably would category recreation 
douglas object put park land category 
this problem discuss briefly well military reservation categorize 
ronald becker question put 
wetland category low activity say many wetland area united state provide recreational agricultural industrial activity 
becker suggest add wetland sub category water 
there disagreement suggestion johnson point actually many first level category could include wetland sub category 
johnson close session say discussion today conference session help provide basis national land use classification scheme 
the conference steer committee continue work definition category refine scheme use national regional state local agency 
national level planning and land use information need session june james anderson aag university florida chairman jerome gockowski soil conservation service reporter ronald shelton university illinois technical advisor 
chairman anderson indicate session meet after coffee break session combine joint session meet balance day 
this make certain idea suggestion participant nearly represent concensus conference 
anderson hopeful land use scheme develop assist user use ert data 
some participant conference suggest follow meeting 
anderson felt necessary comment surely mechanism establish carry function however likely do need experiment result ert simulate space flight 
item major concern first second category level third fourth category level come later 
try take exist scheme incorporate see come scheme utilize immediately 
another point consider fact many dimension use remote sense data identification land use 
this may pose hazard look dimension current use 
however cost factor various reason start land use 
the problem multiple use land much 
the user must determine primary use parcel land regardless size 
anderson indicate monday scope conference may consider narrow many people would prefer wider perspective 
attempt however keep whatever compatible possible exist system 
anderson indicate would like continue discussion today eight category propose william johnson session yesterday 
these urban farming land grassland forest land low activity wetland cold barren transportation communication water mining quarry 
anderson ask participant review category move second order category 
anderson suggest terminology revise agree well exist land use classification scheme 
suggest add built category urban transportation communication utility remain separate category 
also comment preferred term agriculture farm 
forestry preferable forest land grazing 
grassland etc 
activity orient terminology use classification scheme 
anderson suggest place fish low level categorization although certain state maryland florida may worthy emphasis 
felt also recreational include first level category due million acre national state private park 
change recommend category water 
during previous session conference much discussion term low activity category designation 
the standard land use cod manual us undeveloped canadian system use unproductive rather designation low activity 
anderson ask comment category participant 
raleigh barlowe michigan state university comment session attend yesterday include non urban thing within urban category 
suggest add another category service area include military area sanitary solid waste disposal also cemetaries feel fit list classification 
also comment recreation definitely first order category term 
govind sharma alabama university propose woodland use rather forestry category designation felt forestry tend imply plant commercial forest include natural forest area 
sharma also comment category fishing might mislead interpreter cannot tell whether water include fish 
anderson disagree woodland would preferable forestry category term woodland widely use indicate wooded land forest 
william ogden tva division forestry agree anderson forestry preferable describes use activity much broad scope woodland 
george orning university minnesota comment agree first level category presently list 
felt recreational use good felt low order activity express feel grazing fishing 
comment first level category scheme keep simple possible 
anderson comment consider thing interpret remote sensor imagery first level category feature 
ronald becker louisiana state university comment yesterday session occupancy seem primary consider first level designation today emphasis seem activity 
becker say felt activity consider second third level category 
also comment term low activity somewhat meaningless graze forestry etc 
relatively low activity 
felt wetland distinctive separate category 
becker ask definition occupancy reply felt distinction 
farm farm grassland grazing etc 
anderson comment seem use land decide primarily cover approach first order category propose 
roger hoffer purdue university question whether first order category reflect data available remote sensing 
there two question involve what remote sense provide user need 
what userft need remote sense provide 
remote sensor people ask whether land use classification set deal completely cover condition certain degree ground truth require order set satisfactory calssfication 
the answer question help determine whether recreational activity first order category classification 
perhaps look cannot obtain remote sense imagery regard land use classification 
anderson comment heard various management people cover classification useful 
ask comment point 
edward han 
corp engineer louis indicate felt cover important useful work 
cover condition consider first order element corp engineer 
han comment also felt recreation include first order level despite fact many recreational us would fall second third level 
anderson indicate wish argue point context discussion believe use cover synonomous term 
george nez federation rocky mountain state denver ask small area far recognize seasonal change identify activity us 
bob douglas pennsylvania state university comment wished protect classification rather eliminate 
felt however recreation include first order level run problem later low level refer specifically forestry 
forestry include management forest land recreation 
example cite pennsylvania forest open day deer season hunter forest side viet nam war 
therefore believe recreation second level category comment could include first order category 
jim lyon bureau outdoor recreation ask forgetting entire dimension thinking classification 
longer deal static map update every year update information every day 
should consider use land various purpose capability land word use give point time compare land cover observe imagery 
anderson agree lyon say favor mixing land capability current land use classification scheme 
many familiar soil conservation service land capability classification scheme however would necessarily effective scheme classify land recreation 
capability subjective judgment capability 
question need kept mind 
some land scs class viii might best recreational land 
bob keith university oregon still question capability remote sense technique classification land use 
ask explanation value remote sense data benefit know much potential 
remote sense imagery basis first order land use classification well understand capability need 
roger hoffer purdue university undertook explain capability remote sense program 
discussed limitation capability remote sense system 
nasa launch first earth resource technology satellite ert early 
this satellite equip return beam vidicon rbv system consist basically three television camera aim spot earth surface 
each camera sensitive different part spectrum one green one red one infrared 
the second system erts multispectral scanner ms consist four different wavelength band record data spot ground 
since go repeat coverage every day sort automatic system handle data require 
these data send back earth electronic signal convert image form need 
the spot look sensor ground acre size 
hoffer explain manner flight would overlap day day thus provide synoptic data 
the flight path mile wide 
ert launch similar ert except heat sensitive multispectral scanner capable detecting heat energy 
skylab schedule launched time ert man satellite provide film recovery 
many sensor system skylab basically medical space research 
the sensor skylab include channel multispectral scanner gather data regard material surface ground channel camera system 
the advantage skylab system much good resolution film data available 
the delay get data back difference time process pose problem 
the day follow launch skylab three astronaut launch join capsule skylab 
the astronaut remain skylab day come normal entry 
about raonth turn around time require next crew launch 
the second set astronaut period day return 
then day third group astronauts another day period 
kenneth dueker university iowa comment planner interested one dimension cover may one dimension planner interested much gravel much forestry much grazing give county one time also capability 
different location criterion depend whether section county state 
may question regard different point time comparison point time 
the session adjourn time

several participant express concern agreement could reach effectively definition weight 
the session adjourn allow participant attend close conference plenary session 
joint meeting session and conference closing june anderson convene joint session turn floor arch park nasa headquarters give participant background information remote sensor system erts ert skylab satellite high altitude aircraft overflight 
park explain characteristic equipment carry satellite platform 
comment nasa learn quite lot plan first experimental resource satellite erts future resource satellite mission benefit experience 
park indicate nasa interested interpretation data geometry data 
park indicate radar feasible bug work image see correct 
there however problem scanner 
the curvilinear scan adjust come rectilinear scan result reasonably planimetric correct base map 
roll pitch yaw must contend spacecraft 
although technology correction put together available system know 
scanner mount space platform necessary resolution provide imagery make good map 
geometrical correction handle system cheap 
park comment ert satellite slow rate consequently scan data provide overlap 
the best resolution would foot 
response question regard amount coverage park answer united state cover every pas satellite regardless cloud cover 
there least one complete picture eastern one west cloud cover great east 
gerlach ask entire state would cover park reply state trust territory would include 
principal investigator research proposal accept nasa provide data requirement free charge requester may obtain data nominal fee either nasa data bank interior department land area national oceanic atmospheric administration data obtain water area 
worldwide coverage available satellite sensor turn time open sky policy adhere 
however foreign country make bilaterial agreement satellite data gather 
park mention particular mexico brazil make bilaterial agreement 
the nasa data bank hop data available user within day complete overflight however due time lapse transfer data available quickly source 
park comment experiment one large nasa undertaken expect obtain data product week overflight 
gockowski ask park resolution photography obtain skylab 
park say earth terrain camera resolution foot film photo combination filter polarize filter 
the lunar terrain camera inch format inch focal length provide meter resolution color 
the film use camera 
resolution excess line pair per millimeter whereas human eye capability less line pair per millimeter 
both camera calibrate department interior national bureau standard 
park say acre field could study resultant data acre field would easier 
during skylab orbit picture star field take possible make measurement camera 
the radiometer scatterometer scan area nautical mile altimeter radiometer scatterometer 
this device work accuracy meter however cannot track skylab closely 
the band radiometer treat application instrument frozen land indicate reading

anderson thank park resume1 sensor system resultant data expect received nasa satellite high altitude overflight 
anderson review first order category identify mainly basis land cover 
these category 
urban built 
transportation communication utility 
farm agriculture 
grassland grazing 
forest land forestry 
barren land 
permanent snow field response anderson call comment question miss mcgregor metropolitan council twin city area ask marshland include fresh water well salt water 
anderson respond yes 
another question concern include built area anderson comment lot build cover fall census bureau definition urban 
olaf olson forest service ask grassland include shrub 
anderson respond possibility add shrub land category 
anderson ask prof roger hoffer purdue university department forestry geography opinion regard include shrub land tht grassland category 
hoffer reply would decide upon user would difficult delineate boundary 
anderson take propose sub category urban build category 
urban built 
commercial trade industrial manufacturing service recreational transportation communication utility urban area other first order category farm occur predominantly urban context raleigh barlowe michigan state university indicate first order category really describe land appearance cover second order category important planner user land use information 
comment user need third fourth level 
barlowe agree 
however first order element present sufficient level 
james wray usgs geographic application program comment dilemma attempt make classification scheme use information receive remote sensor versus information traditionally obtain 
wray agree however tentative first second order category indicate anderson 
response anderson request comment someone suggest open space instead recreation however anderson say would cover breakdown category 
tom1inson suggest add outdoor recreation sub category many type indoor recreation movie house etc 
discernable level 
ross netherton bureau outdoor recreation ask would include service sub category 
anderson respond use term context standard land use cod manual military area shop center doctor etc 
these service necessarily identifiable remote sensor 
netherton felt perhaps term include category 
anderson continue outline sub category propose rest first level 
transportation communication utility 
sub category propose time 
farm agriculture cropland pasture orchard vineyard horticultural area 
grassland graze rangeland sub category propose time 
forestry forest land sub category propose time 
extract mining quarry sub category propose time 
fish sub category propose time 
water lake stream pond reservoir low activity land marshland tundra barren land permanent snow field afternoon joint session anderson open session state try get compatibility land use classification united state also would extremely useful international level ask arch gerlach report conference participant current information receive regard international land use classification 
among several foreign country contact gerlach japan seem conduct one comprehensive land use survey mapping operation 
about percent japan map 
the original purpose land use survey provide information reconstruction purpose world war 
two series land use map prepare one scale 
scale land use classification use japanese category agriculture grass land forest park urban rural settlement miscellaneous 
all primary category break sub category 
for example agriculture sub divide paddy field land field orchard tea plantation 
scale classification much detail 
gerlach comment felt useful consider problem land use classification see country develop 
conclude remark say hop could map entire united state scale land use purpose 
anderson continue discussion land use category present earlier cautioned participant try get many different sub category major category use national level 
edward davis bureau outdoor recreation comment see necessity urban category 
say today definition urban rural land specific 
james wray usgs geographic application program indicate classification scheme work project two category urban non urban 
these two category break sub category 
davit say bureau census change think definition urban area 
anderson agree true comment also legal connotation urban 
raleigh barlowe say bother definition build particularly area yehowstone national park include category 
suggest talk term urban urban orient build area 
anderson respond national park include urban build area although previous inference might draw point 
robert cook university cincinnati remind group really consider category scale map national land use plan scale map state level planning 
really concerned map data collection metropolitan planning 
george orning university minnesota say work identify urban include acre cell contain five structure regardless locate within cell 
cook comment use satellite imagery may possible use university minnesota definition urban 
david himmelberger usda statistical reporting service suggest combine category agriculture grassland 
these could specify second third level category 
also comment believe define scale map relation category decide upon 
anderson ask would favor put grassland agriculture sub category 
reply felt second third level 
suggest put cropland pasture agriculture second level orchard etc 
third level category 
himmelberger comment believed statistical reporting service would interested land use map first level entire united state could update rapidly satellite data 
ernest hardy cornell university say experience new york state study find difficult identify pasture urge term use scheme least first second level 
comment another problem transition land agriculture use 
common error consider land use intensify always true land us also extensifying 
himmelberger comment time element certainly consider land use sometimes seasonal 
gerlach comment japanese land use classification use wild grassland pasture area hay crop etc 
anderson ask representative university minnesota define grassland pasture oming reply use term pasture area work machinery 
they try identify grassland use pasture open land classification 
sizer comment try determine use idle land put try predict future us 
say good deal land transition stage 
barlowe comment hesitent combine three category agriculture grassland forestry category constitute large area entire united state 
say perhaps would able arrive good definition grazing pasture land 
question also farmsteads wood lot etc 
place agriculture build 
tomlinson felt distinction active agriculture marginal farm go production 
comment believe category grassland keep 
anderson say felt unless strong feeling contrary incline leave first level category presently list 
anderson ask question comment concern category forest land 
fernald florida state university comment florida problem categorize land around eglin afb much forest 
suggest use symbol identify military area 
hardy suggest productive capacity forest land indicate 
there problem identify delineate forest land brush land 
felt recreational us management decision clearly visible surface therefore include classification scheme 
anderson felt land use category forest land compatible present forest service classification 
olin bock forest service ask desirability try identify area visible surface open pit mine quarry 
felt underground mine gas oil well etc 
included category extract 
anderson comment might necessary include pond sub category water 
ask comment water category 
bock suggest include large water area chesapeake bay second level category water particularly area readily identifiable include important us oyster clam bed 
anderson agree good point 
crittenden ask include coastal zone category 
gerlach comment important land designation perhaps include first level 
this particularly true since political controversey designation wetland 
gerlach remind participant first second level land use scheme must decide upon soon nasa high altitude satellite overflight data must utilize rapidly possible optimum result 
thank conference participant aid help arrive proper decision first second level category 
close conference gerlach announce several document first list attendee mail participant 
later hope issue set paper give open plenary session june finally complete proceeding conference 
part land use classification scheme for use with remote sensor data preliminary version prepare james anderson ernest hardy john roach inter agency steer committee land use information classification unite state department interior geological survey washington 
the need for standardization the use space borne platform rapid development remote sense technology indicate today capability exist produce timely accurate inventory current use nation land resource 
important ever history nation land use classification scheme develop satisfy majority user local state federal private sector deal information nationwide basis 
although differ perspective classification process process tend subjective matter nevertheless urgent need development standardize approach land use classification meet requirement user 
although unlikely one ideal classification ever develop document present classification scheme believe meet need land inventory information major part nation 
see later detailed classification probably require regional user specific application forest wildlife management urban planning etc 
first approximation national framework land use classification propose hopefully 
satisfy need federal agency date overview land use throughout country basis uniform date scale categorization first second digit level 
utilize best feature exist widely use classification scheme extent land use category schemes amenable use remote sense 
provide open end classification system enable regional state local agency develop detailed land use classification scheme third fourth digit level meet particular need still compatible national system 
receptive data instrument satellite high altitude aircraft platform 
land many attribute characteristic information need planning management program us 
present use one characteristic land widely recognize significant attribute yet considerable diversity opinion actually constitute land use 
one concept much merit usefulness term land use refer jjnan activity land directly relate land 
land cover another term generally interpret refer vegetational artificial construction cover land surface 
some activity man quite directly relate specific type land cover 
for example presence plant corn likely indicate farm present land activity particular tract land 
therefore reliable inference generally make imagery corn identify type land cover farm activity may actually visible present 
recreational activity often much difficult relate directly particular type land cover use remote sense technique therefore direct field observation enumeration likely complementary technique need identify land use activity effectively 
this propose land use classification design primary reliance remote sense technique generalize first second level categorization therefore activity dimension land use appear third fourth level categorization 
development the classification scheme several land use classification scheme design amenable use remote sense technique serve initial framework conference land use information classification hold june washington sponsor geological survey national aeronautics space administration soil conservation service 
land use classification scheme initially propose anderson design place major reliance upon remote sensing 
however supplementary source information assume available elaborate two scheme propose 
from extend discussion take place conference steer committee plan help interpret conference discussion propose test land use classification scheme could use remote sensor data minimal reliance supplemental information generalize first second level categorization 
time clearly recognize participate conference discussion careful attention give need compatibility generalize level land use categorization find classification scheme currently use 
example currently use classification scheme standard land use cod manual inventory major us land water make every five year economic research service department agriculture national inventory soil water conservation need initiate carried second time several cooperate agency department agriculture department interior 
prepare definitional structure land use classification scheme decide experience accumulate center aerial photographic study cornell university carry new york state land use natural resource inventory would serve valuable point departure 
therefore ernest hardy john roach ask collaborate prepare definitional framework present report 
the experience new york state review carefully relation much vary complex definitional framework need entire united state 
result extend review numerous alteration make definition land use category use new york state order make definition applicable country whole 
develop land use classification scheme use remote sensor data would usable throughout united state attention give mainly generalize first second level categorization 
definition category two level categorization subject selective test evaluation staff geographic application program geological survey project use imagery obtain primarily high altitude flight 
throughout development test process need detail land use category third fourth level categorization clearly recognize 
the testing propose classification scheme carry follow geographic application program research project 
central atlantic regional ecological test site 
phoenix pilot project 
land use map ozark regional commission 
concurrently research conduct lawrence petting forestry remote sense laboratory school forestry conservation university california berkeley charles poulton oregon state university the application high altitude photography vegetation resource inventory southeastern arizona contract national aeronautics space administration 
this research provide valuable insight land use mosaic southwestern united state 
the hierarchal classification barren land natural vegetation rangeland part united state particularly significant contribution development land use classification scheme procedure amenable use remote sensing technique 
some definitional structure barren land rangeland suggest petting poulton recognize land use classification scheme propose use throughout united state 
use land use classification scheme present report important first recognize clearly generalize first second level classification scheme 
present secondly definitional structure first approximation capable refinement basis extend vary use 
also must remember principal immediate objective develop land use classification scheme soon possible provide scheme iis number major research activity associate test various remote sense technique 
previously emphasize basic long range objective provide usable standardized scheme land use classification use national regional basis 
the successful attainment second objective quite dependent upon effective revision improvement result widespread use propose scheme 
course also possible use propose scheme large scale imagery well land use data gather approach direct enumeration observation 
classification theory and principle 
there one ideal inventory natural resource 
recognition thii factor develop inventory lead many 
assumption inventory establish 
change adjustment organization 
possible deal resource associate land use 
there logical reason expect one detailed inventory 
adequate relatively short period time 
affect creation pattern land use 
each land use 
classification make suit need user user 
land use information satisfy inventory 
satisfy least specific major need 
often challenge explain land use inventory cannot generated manner relatively similar taxonomic concept vegetative biological classification base 
there three major reason system successful land use classification 
the first major reason taxonomic approach assume separate class establish accommodate every variable item classify 
instead fragmentation process land use classification base upon ability aggregate various kind land use one class 
the two process essentially orient opposite direction 
the two major reason base upon practical problem acquisition information land use large land mass air photo map etc 
variability need user information 
characteristic resource inventory process 
one major control land use classification budget axy restraint user 
there case availability fund factor determine complexity land use inventory source information use rare allow field work would desirable 
caliber skill technical staff available job 
case final product must adhere kind control mechanism 
the end result inventory develop offer partial definition certain area classification area cover reduce manageable size combination restraint 
two characteristic land use inventory flexibility repeat create certain unique demand structure inventory 
desirable able accommodate new variable kind information aggregate acquire information variety grouping 
these feature flexibility provide recognize period creation inventory 
high order level land use classification scheme expect demand inclusion different kind land use originally expect 
flexibility allow desire inventory viable long period time longer span usefulness 
repeat essential characteristic expect use classification basis inventory provide information change land use period time 
repeatable unusually high quality description provide 
each classification unit thoroughly describe word supplement picture grind aerial different group technicians repeat inventory later date 
this complex problem usually recognize inventory end one time inventory lack attention problem 
inventory serve purpose establish base line information time creation must provide descriptive material adequate allow repeat 
source information 
land use inventory since period air photo generally available usually involve application form air photo interpretation 
this source information usually supplement degree source information include roadside aerial survey kind resource map thematic map social cultural economic information 
the general use air photo past three decade add another form restraint inventory process 
generally require inventory land use basis see identify acceptable degree accuracy black white aerial photograph 
specialized photo available often use frequently budget restraint project preclude use large area 
air photo however provide desirable feature inventory use 
they inexpensive generally unbiased provide information know point time condition usually identify 
their interpretation however usually vary considerably accord skill background user 
other source information include skill knowledge individual work inventory report survey map source allow geographically locate data contribute inventory 
general rule valuable use uninterpreted information inventory 
far valuable include internal drainage characteristic soil make map area soil drainage unsuited particular use 
almost user inventory find use former data would need latter 
also interpret information add high degree confusion unless work exceptionally well document 
without acceptable documentation interpret information negate necessary capacity repeat inventory 
the decision process 
land use classification rare find clearly define class prefer work 
presentation classification theory illustration often develop use bolt screw nail population need classify 
our task far complex find debate fine point draw line water land 
first decision seem obvious one considers problem seasonally wet area coastal tidal flat marsh swamp bog various type plant provide degree crown cover assume simplicity decision becomes cloud 
this characteristic problem classification process yet essential generation usable inventory 
most type land use wish classify inventory process appear continuous gradation zero use full use 
the problem must solve place boundary around use wish classify 
how small area land discard equipment allow call junkyard 
how large area particular use acknowledge presence use 
how resolve problem encounter area heterogeneous mixture equally significant land use 
these kind question easily answer 
case problem identify point continuous 
gradation scale determine land use change occurs 
documentation description may provide main answer problem 
case junkyard example wish identify 
area certain select size junkyard state 
identification size basis source informa 
tion use criterion decision process establish 
the illustration one less difficult problem 
many area country land release 
agriculture large area various stage aforestation 
much land yet qualify wood forest 
continuous gradation cover woody plant material 
start within year land drop crop production 
possible find area discernible line identify change generate low sparse bush growth stand marketable timber 
the solution example hinge well documented decision line would draw separate brush forest 
first seem arbitrary contradictory goal previously state could prove way 
but properly document adequate description illustration quality repeat inventory preserve 
this necessary activity create classification inventory illustrate well previously state situation indicate land use classification often problem aggregate land use suitable classifiable unit 
the illustration serve also emphasize significance user need develop classification system 
obviously commercial interest forestry would require different breakdown land various kind vegetative growth would regional planner transportation department engineer 
the expect use determine line separation shall draw 
other area major problem decision make process include interface land us 
there find area mixture occur 
readily identify example large area urban fringe suburban influence land find around urban area 
combination factor include source information fund available significance land use area minimum map unit form basis decision 
similarly area multiple us occur graze woodland area variety factor use form decision case separate class may use thereby avoid make decision 
problem arise also try satisfy wish inventory user conflict use occur involve mixture cover versus activity 
many recreational activity fall area concern 
for example hunt common recreation use land hunt do land well classify forest range agricultural land us 
consequently hunt land use may require separate uniquely classified inventory 
easily fit inventory base kind information source commonly work 
present land use major information map land use inventory 
usually far expensive include factor ownership large area inventory 
land capability classification also frequently request implies introduction interpret information well consider separate inventory format 
certain instance problem arise due dual land use activity 
example use cave production mushroom 
this kind situation always easily resolve 
approach point view high use concept 
significant information concept may handle basis 
point information source 
case confusion large area conflict land use resolve use general statement guideline 
technically graze cattle whether east west rangeland type use 
however management practice east substantially different west simple task resolve difference classification description 
but major decision base operational management clearly state area country state term range use instead term pasture solve conflict 
the classification 
once classification system decide upon three basic rule standard serve guide creation use 
the classification must 
allow discreet assignment item 
provide unique description item 
the classification comprehensive two way 
allow classification surface area within study area 
and also provide unit reference land use 
this may usually require use one classification unit entitle 
provide thorough unique description item inventory one frequently state include well include severe problem discreet assignment usually resolve 
event practice combine sound decision concern margin cut point class allow land use area assign without question one classification unit 
geographic location record information 
inventory attempt form geographic reference system require 
this may include reference usgs topographic map area may base longitude latitude state plane coordinate range township system utm grid universal transverse mercator grid system desire user 
case service provide geographic referencing use basis choice reference system 
inventory cannot much use user unless form measurement assign item classify inventory 
there three major mean record map information 
they include measurement unit represent area length point 
use kind measure able quantify information inventory
