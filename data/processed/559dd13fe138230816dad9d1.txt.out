thus surprising noted assessment methodology section sometimes confuse misinterpret national research council controversial reliability assessment effectiveness exploration use industry question label biased met less enthusiastic response see century cochran douglas gillette hayes kerr mankin menard sharman north parent linden rocky mountain association geologist schantz steinhart bultman time magazine warman wilson 
mankin report national reseach council note national assessment department interior absence clearly define assessment procedure unambiguously understood member assessment team 
that report also conclude the usgs management provide insufficient manpower fund incentives carry national oil gas assessment uniform level excellence dimension 
there doubt explain defend assessment methodology expert system lend objectivity wonder assessment number generate 
petroleum assessment must ongoing process team scientist spend time resource assessment spor 
adic high intensity eleventh hour effort inconvenience assessor would rather conduct research

for year geological survey accumulate data knowledge occurrence hydrocarbon united state geological survey leader national expertise study resource reserve 
however time hand knowledge need aggregate interactive computer repository 
petroleum assessment task beg great utilization expert system 
implement coordinate strategy characterize petroleum potential all united state federal land indian reservation hydrocarbon play wilderness area cetera could prove highly efficacious reduce total man hour produce great compatibility among province 
when one compare publish literature expert system theory application conclusion evident geological survey probably several year behind rest world use modern genre user friendly expert system ass petroleum resource 
expert system manipulate large number variable lend automation qualitative criterion reach valid conclusion rapidly output graphic 
there wealth important multivariate spatial data specific geographic sedimentary basin great demand daily basis

appendix what make expert system and how do work 
the follow take schaub 
expert system futuristic science fiction product threaten replace human worker provide incomprehensibly complex solution commonsense problem 
instead business tool help enhance quality availability knowledge require decision make professional wide range industry 
design implement correctly expert system provide business user high powered complement conventional program databases word processor spreadsheet analysis 
expert system differ conventional application software follow way the sophistication user interface 
the existence knowledge base system relate concept enable computer approximate human judgment 
the expert system shell interpreter 
shell actually process information enter user relates concept contain knowledge base provide assessment judgment solution particular problem question 
note principle conventional programming language use build knowledge base need call artificial intelligence language lisp prolog 
the shell simplifies process create knowledge base 
interface design 
traditionally interface design expert system hinge graphical capability unconventional method enter data system 
for example many expert system use mouse data entry well mac become accepted corporate america 
graphical interface supply information number form simple text dress window pop menus actual graphical object design represent thing like statistical information flow logic 
now much style integrate conventional application particular use expert system 
expert system may express idea solution explanation use complex convention row number pie chart brief message out space drive 
practical example include draw map expert 
system provide direction geographic analysis expression financial relationship complex chart organize dynamically emphasize particular point 
the user interface intrinsically limit capability expert system reason 
enhances ability user computer gain well complete understanding assessment 
knowledge base 
the knowledge base library rule expert system use make decision offering solution problem 
general system design specifically manipulate information particular form knowledge base 
knowledge base traditionally describe large system statement description mislead 
knowledge base may contain definitive rule may contain many object associative relationship different concept statistical information probability certain solution simply large database fact compare one another base simple convention intrinsic expert system 
example expert system design manage portfolio would include hard financial concept equation soft information rule thumb concern appropriate time buy sell base intuitive feel specific expert investor read technical trend 
the rule may categorically favor certain investment high tech firm 
and developer may encode concept legal limitation expert system 
create the knowledge base 
the way information get knowledge base dependent specific expert system 
generally cod hand like traditional program knowledge engineer perform structure interview expert particular field 
there way emerge 
far hand cod neural network intrinsic capability memorize learn pattern reinforce trainer expert specific field 
the main purpose knowledge base provide gut expert system connection among idea concept statistical probability allow reason part system perform accurate evaluation potential problem asset investment 
how about the shell 
expert system shell provide layer user interface computer operate system manage input output data 
also manipulate information provide user conjunction knowledge base arrive particular conclusion 
the structure shell similar interpreter front end database program richer capable take fact assertion condition contain knowledge base apply input data 
the shell often sell end product allow purchaser encode knowledge base scratch way user would 
purchase database system store information provide company 
hand knowledge base sell product shell interpreter may incidental part package way user might buy data complete work william shakespeare body data relevant user business 
case user immediately take advantage exist library judgment provide system 
system software help hindrance 
the computer operate system play important role implementation expert system 
the operating system provide basic capability machine expert system include file management user interface support memory management interface product might want share information contain expert system 
the operating system resource utility may intrinsically provide needed capability example graphic mouse support database management therefore ease need additional programming 
case operate system may even provide convention interfacing expert system program 
the disadvantage use operate system facility limit control developer facility likely performance degradation 
believe example presentation manager provide much good interface support do less plumbing work expert system developer 
use and misuse the expert system 
the purpose expert system enhance enable judgment part human replace human judgment altogether 
expert system provide relatively naive user lucid powerful assessment problem expert either unavailable practical involve expert decision 
additionally expert system without formal training system help user learn concept method decision analysis process solve problem conjunction computer valuable asset business situation 
over time user properly implement expert system opportunity absorb expert rule intuitive decision making skill 
expert system breed knowledge engineer the follow take charland 
mid 1970s boeing aerospace find corporate predicament 
two lead aircraft design obsolescent 
there immediate need train young engineer development new system 
but firm design need update number lead engineer retire 
how could boeing change product line personnel time 
management decide assign retire tool design engineer mentor young engineer 
each pair work computer aid design station 
senior engineer teach novice design store computer memory 
the company discover unforeseen benefit 
their computer create entire library design information 
now could use expertise senior engineer long individual retire 
today boeing experience commonplace field expert system 
computer use much calculating figure store data 
they transmit store knowledge problem solve skill expert professional well

richardson see several form expert system develop different market 
many large organization develop computer support system internal operation select transportation system trouble shoot maintenance 
the campbell company expert system cook soup 
other expert system provide skill knowledge mass individual common information need 
there expert system tutor student begin algebra another help tax return 
noetic inc englewood develop expert system prepare will 
many popular application subspecialties law 
richardson find narrowly define expert system function best 
you need knowledge base say 
reid merrill brunson denver base management consult firm develop system test job applicant customer service sale 
the firm year accumulate data trait aptitude sale professional 
past share information consultation write report 
now computer system make test data available hiring manager across country touch button 
third market lie software development 
number company create expert system development program shell noncomputer specialist 
jackie nairn high tech marketing professional recently complete master thesis expert system 
she find two kind shell emerge one large organization one specialize task tax form preparation 
the successful system solve simple problem nairn say 
the new job role expert system vary area computer science 
they range software developer market support position 
one key job knowledge engineer 
that person help expert specialist communicate knowledge computer technician 
some knowledge engineer strong technical skill program advanced list processor lisp landguage 
all conversant technical challenge design expert system 
knowledge engineer also must good listener pick brain problem solve skill specialist 
richardson find best people strong background 
cognitive psychology well computer science 
they appreciate hov human being computer process knowledge 
the colorado institute artificial intelligence additional information job train expert system

the tremendous advance last year computer technology evolve four generation 
the fourth generation still active belongs supercomputer however next fifth generation computer revolutionarily different encompass function knowledge symbolic processing data numerical processing associate previous generation computer 
understandably geologist slow initially make use computer work nature geological research except area ray crystallography geostatistics etc 
involves little exact computation instead require interpretation base incomplete imprecise data 
thus number crunch computer find application geology 
however recent surge use microcomputer mostly word processing graphic application 
those read aapg explorer especially july issue also introduce expert system aware explosive interest show geologist application microcomputer phase oil exploration 
this naturally bring question expert system multifaceted endeavor oil exploration 
when review step phase require oil exploration lead prospect delineation phase may tie four basic question must raise delineate favorable zone petroleum accumulation 
clear exploration effort may characterize expert task many exploration phase task require subjective interpretation base incomplete imprecise data 
the degree confidence interpretation varies depend strength evidence
