summary the retinoblastoma protein prb tumor suppressor block cell proliferation repress e2f transcription factor 
this inhibition relieve mitogen induced phosphorylation prb trigger e2f release activation cell cycle gene 
e2f1 also activate proapoptotic gene response genotoxic oncogenic stress 
however prb role context establish 
here show dna damage e1a induce oncogenic stress promote formation prb e2f1 complex even proliferate cell 
moreover prb bound proapoptotic promoter transcript active prb require maximal apoptotic response vitro vivo 
together data reveal direct role prb induction apoptosis response genotoxic oncogenic stress 
introduction the retinoblastoma gene rb1 member pocket protein family p107 p130 ﬁrst know tumor suppressor 
the retinoblastoma protein prb target transform protein dna tumor viruses adenoviral e1a functionally inactivate large proportion human tumor cell due mutation either rb1 gene upstream regulator trimarchi lee 
prb tumor suppressive activity think largely dependent upon ability directly bind member e2f family transcription factor prevent promote transcription gene require cell proliferation trimarchi lee 
this inhibition occur via two distinct mechanism prb bind sequence within e2f transactivation domain inhibits function result prb e2f complex recruit number transcript corepressors include histone deacetylases hdacs methyltransferases polycomb group proteins actively repress promoter e2f target gene 
normal cell prb repressive activity control cell cycle dependent phosphorylation trimarchi lee 
response mitogen signal prb sequentially phosphorylated cdk complex cyclin cdk4 cyclin cdk2 
this phosphorylation sufﬁcient induce prb release e2f thereby allow activation e2f responsive gene late 
however phosphorylated prb pprb persist nucleus remainder cell cycle dephosphorylated protein phosphatase end mitosis ludlow 
widely assume pprb functionally inactive dephosphorylation restores prb active state 
the majority human tumor carry mutation disable prb mediate repression e2f sherr mccormick 
these mutation either inactivate rb1 gene promote prb phosphorylation absence normal mitogen signal activation cyclin cdk4 kinases inactivation cdk inhibitor p16 
these change result inappropriate release e2f thereby induce transcript activation e2f target gene consequently cell proliferation 
significance retinoblastoma protein prb function disrupt many human tumor either inactivation rb1 gene alteration upstream regulator 
prb tumor suppressive activity least partially dependent upon ability arrest cell e2f inhibition 
our data establish second role prb stress induce activator apoptosis 
notably prb ability promote either arrest apoptosis seem context dependent apoptosis favor proliferating cell 
this ﬁnding potential explain cell typically resistant apoptosis arrest state 
most importantly observation suggest rb1 status inﬂuence tumor response chemotherapy impair arrest apoptotic checkpoint response

cancer cell prb induce apoptotic gene response stress 
well establish e2f1 among e2f family member also contribute induction apoptosis response either dna damage oncogenic stress iaquinta lee 
this think critical event suppress formation tumor 
work many laboratory show genotoxic stress induces e2f1 recruitment promoter proapoptotic gene include p73 caspase coincident transcript activation even cell retain wild type prb pediconi 
this lead consider prb inﬂuences dna damage induce apoptosis 
the prevailing view prb antiapoptotic regulator 
early support model come ﬁnding several tissue mutant mouse display ectopic proliferation apoptosis jack 
however clear much apoptosis non cell autonomous result proliferation defect extraembryonic tissue bruin wenzel 
analysis tissue speciﬁc mutant model reinforce notion prb play much nuanced role apoptosis 
loss prb neuronal tissue macpherson lung masonrichie wikenheiser brokamp skin ruiz intestine haigis wang drive ectopic proliferation effect apoptosis 
contrast inactivation lens bruin myoblasts huh induce apoptosis speciﬁcally observe differentiate cell 
thus take together mouse study support two general conclusion ﬁrst many different setting inactivation induce inappropriate proliferation without trigger apoptosis second apoptosis observe seem result inability cease proliferation undergo terminal differentiation 
prb apoptotic role also analyze establish tissue culture cell line 
however study yield conﬂicting result conclude prb suppresses apoptosis almasan bosco knudsen whereas other suggest proapoptotic araki bowen knudsen 
none study address molecular basis observe role prb 
study investigate prb inﬂuences ability e2f induce apoptosis response genotoxic stress 
result stabilization prb e2f1 complex response dna damage cell commit die apoptosis response either dna damage oncogenic stress e2f1 transcript activity direct toward promoter subset apoptotic gene include caspase p73 apaf1 iaquinta lee 
thus hypothesize dna damage must somehow inactivate prb repressive function allow release transcript active e2f1 
test hypothesis assess bind prb e2f1 doxorubicin treatment human t98g cell 
however contrary expectation find prb e2f1 complex stabilize genotoxic stress figure 
notably t98g cell p53 defective therefore treatment doxorubicin cause accumulate figure 
thus conclude 
observe dna damage induce formation prbe2f1 complex neither dependent p53 simply indirect consequence arrest 
prb ability bind e2f normally limit early stage cell cycle prb exists hypophosphorylated form 
therefore surprising observe prb e2f1 complex population highly enriched phase cell 
directly address inﬂuence cell cycle phase use serum deprivation readdition generate two population t98g cell greatly enrich either proliferate phase cell figure treat doxorubicin 
consistent know cell cycle dependent phosphorylation prb prb protein present slow mobility form untreated proliferate cell bound little e2f1 figure 
notably doxorubicin treatment still able induce formation prb e2f1 complex proliferate population figure 
this occur independently change total level e2f1 protein figure correlate full activation apoptotic program judge parp p85 induction data show 
importantly cell within proliferate population cannot fully account dna damage induce prb e2f1 complex treat proliferate cell untreated cell comparable level prb associate e2f1 figure fraction cell enrich population differ fold versus 
thus data show prb e2f1 complex form phase cell response dna damage 
prb sequentially phosphorylated cyclin cdk4 cyclin cdk2 complex think disrupt interaction prb e2f 
since dna damage cause prb bind e2f1 irrespective cell cycle phase wish determine whether pprb could participate complex 
end generate enriched population proliferate t98g cell expose either ionize radiation doxorubicin see schema figure leave panel assess level e2f1 bind property pprb use antibody speciﬁcally recognize know cdk phosphorylation site within prb pser780 pser795 pser807

this increase binding occur independently change total level e2f1 figure right panel 
interestingly doxorubicin increase level pprb population figure compare lane lane even though neither treatment alter cell cycle distribution cell figure right panel 
the increase level pprb treat cell clearly contribute seem insufﬁcient fully account increased level e2f1 pprb immunoprecipitates

discussion the e2f transcription factor play key role promote cellular proliferation control prb tumor suppressor 
well establish e2f1 among e2f family member also contribute induction apoptosis response either dna damage oncogenic stress iaquinta lee 
however role prb process poorly understood

this model support three central observation prb induce bind e2f1 histone acetylase caf dna damage cell chip rechip assay show unequivocally prb bound promoter proapoptotic gene transcript active 
knockdown genetic ablation experiment conﬁrm prb loss typically reduce apoptotic response dna damage 
since apoptotic threshold determine many different factor degree impairment striking 
moreover observe many different setting include primary tumor cell derive either mouse human independent p53 
thus ﬁnding prb proapoptotic activity broad relevance 
the concept prb participate transcript active complex without precedent since prb show cooperate differentiation speciﬁc transcription factor activation key target gene charles gery thomas 
however proapoptotic function prb observe situation

note strong correlation proliferative property cell observed role prb apoptosis 
thus propose follow model prb action figure 
cell genotoxic stress induces prb recruitment classic repressive prb e2f hdac complex 
this prevent cell cycle entry thus act indirectly protect cell apoptosis 
thus cell prb loss would impair arrest thereby promote apoptosis 
contrast proliferate cell genotoxic stress favor formation transcript active prb e2f1 caf complex hyperphosphorylation prb inhibit participation repressive complex 
consequently set prb proapoptotic 
interestingly context dependent model prb function potential explain well establish phenomenon proliferate cell great predisposition undergo apoptosis compare quiescent counterpart
