summary explanation cox singer present catalog concisely summarize geologic geochemical oregrade total tonnage characteristic various type mineral deposit 
the catalog contain numerous numbered model organize accord lithotectonic association deposit model intend aid mineral resource evaluation various program geological survey 
the lack geophysical parameter deposit serious omission 
work currently progress hoover other summarize geophysical characteristic model correspond cox singer volume 
our report present geophysical summary composite four cox singer model deposit relate subaerial felsic mafic extrusive rock 
these four model type deposit classify lindgren epithermal 
these deposit yield precious metal chief commodity 
the cox singer mineral deposit model model number include present geophysical composite creed epithermal vein 25b comstock epithermal vein 25c sado epithermal vein 25d quartz alunite 25e 
the creed comstock epithermal vein model model 25b respectively type often refer quartz adularia adularia sericite low sulfur vein system literature silberman berger heald other henley 
the creed type distinguish high chloride content 
the quartz alunite model comparison sometimes refer highsulfur system 
the sado epithermal vein model takeno deposit japan well described example soeda watanabe type chiefly find japan know silver sulfosalts telluride usually host thick volcanic sequence 
western united state example sado epithermal vein type deposit include bruner nevada hayden hill high grade winter california cox singer 
find geophysical data across type deposit include somewhat arbitrarily 
from description soeda watanabe cox singer deposit appear characteristic share model composite well characteristic cripple creek deposit type 
closely allied deposit within composite model term geophysical signature include polymetallic vein contain sulfide ore various base metal hot spring deposit epithermal deposit agte cripple creek colorado 
cripple creek although peripheral composite model locality one early gravity magnetic study across epithermal system kleinkopf other 
mineral deposit model 25b 25c 25d 25e discriminate cox singer volume largely geochemical signature petrology alteration variation reflect compositional characteristic basement magmatic source region 
the geophysical signature compositional variation subtle unlikely detect confidence use current geophysical method 
for model major petrologic structural characteristic geophysics may discern quite similar thus composite model appear appropriate 
exception find example compare model 25b 25c 25d high fraction metallic sulfide expect certain level epithermal quartz alunite cox singer model 25e also know acid sulfate type epithermal miner 
high sulfur content may express great pyritization affect electrical resistivity especially induced polarization response significantly 
believe however specific variation easily incorporate think user generalize composite model present

rely numerous source data describe geologic environment ore deposit part follow model 
many source relate regional survey across volcanic center western united state 
broad scale appear important volcanic area know produce ore deposit 
for data environment elsewhere irvine smith allis recommend reading 
they provide excellent summary exploration data across volcanic region across 
specific epithermal prospect deposit locate mostly western southwestern pacific area include example new zealand japan 
for western united state contrast rather extensive literature regional geophysical characteristic volcanic environment relative sparsity open literature geophysics scale individual deposit see conceptual geologic model figure 
thus describe geophysics deposit scale part follow section particularly electrical method rely chiefly recent welldescribed examples new zealand japan 
our figure draw literature hishikari deposit japan golden cross deposit new zealand
