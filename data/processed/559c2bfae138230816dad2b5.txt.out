accurate detail surface water data exist properly supplement could provide adequate data input surface water component ground water surface water relationship study 
additional data collection need do area quantitatively determine discharge recharge rate 
supplemental stage data also need place determine water level gradient 
the ground water component ground water surface water relationship study area need much detail extensive data base currently exist 
the relative ease obtain large quantity relatively good quality water result little exploratory knowledge variability aquifer characteristic 
the information available mostly form generality may sufficient provide acceptable estimate quantitative flow relationship area 
the accuracy quantitative estimate flow relationship study area depend amount quality information available entire surface water ground water system area
