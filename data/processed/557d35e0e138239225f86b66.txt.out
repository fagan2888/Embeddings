summary discussion and recommendation soil structure interaction ssi effect may either beneficial detrimental performance structure 
when beneficial incorporating ssi effect seismic code calculation cost effective design possible 
for situation design retrofit bridge dam bury structure etc appropriate inclusion ssi effect seismic calculation may bring large design cost saving society 
there urgent need perform comparative cost benefit review without consider rigorously ssi effect different type construction 
hand determine calculation ssi effect detrimental performance structure mere recognition take effective measure safety well performance achieve 
present status ssi promote practical application ssi evaluation procedure practice engineer must first convince need ssi evaluation 
render evaluation necessity ssi evaluation procedure must become integral part total seismic analysis design process 
current building code base ssi response behavior single degree freedom sdof ssi system incorporate ssi effect period elongation damp increase fundamental mode structure system address total effect ssi additional effect scatter seismic input motion global well local soil non linearity promote use proper ssi evaluation procedure design process 
past ssi research concentrate solution gross dynamic response behavior simple linear ssi system 
recent research also tend focus study ssi problem solve simple linear theory 
ssi research time research advance beyond study simple linear ssi system start develop realistic ssi evaluation procedure need practical design purpose 
evaluation nonlinear soil resistance behavior soilfoundation interface pressure 
date evaluation seismic ssi effect place emphasis seismic system demand seismic ssi system response behavior 
time extend evaluation ssi system performance require evaluation system demand also corresponding strength ductility capacity 
context ssi system capacities interest capacity soil foundation interaction system 
fact realistic evaluation ssi system demand must incorporate realistic constitutive behavior soil foundation system allowable capacity limit 
experimental research limit confirmation ssi system response behavior 
must design conducted manner order improve ssi system model facilitate assessment ssi system performance performance limit 
facilitate practical application ssi researcher must also develop make available practice engineer set reliable easy use computer software conduct realistic ssi evaluation 
the number paper ssi japan steady last year 
this imply support ssi research increase recent year 
ssi interdisciplinary geotechnical structural hence tend poorly understood side 
there big gap soa state art knowledge practicing engineer 
ssi complex define exactly 
define condition ssi important however 
let define know contribution make improve knowledge transfer 
emphasize code orient research much need communicate practitioner essential aspect problem 
need distinguish heavy nuclear power plant ordinary building 
nuclear plant already design consideration ssi 
for building case ssi important 
these case identify 
our knowledge ordinary building structure limit need emphasize ssi research ordinary type building 
there virtually full scale experiment building 
single degree freedom sdof structure rigid foundation common type research topic 
much research do subject 
flexible foundation multi degree freedom mdof structure difficult analyze little research do topic 
individual footing beneath column also difficult analyze little work do subject 
there virtually field performance data ssi 
exist data inadequate 
interpretation field data earthquake important verify methodology 
there lot research pile foundation 
however great need translate accumulate knowledge practice 
need detail experiment 
general linear elastic analysis good building surface foundation 
building soil building interaction iii 
single building embed foundation 
linear analysis bad 
past experience show linear model stay 
they around long time despite nonlinear alternative remain 
however linear elastic analysis shortcoming build soil building interaction foundation embed 
the standpoint practitioner ssi necessary aspect design process 
think demonstrate 
need period lengthen foundation damp useful practicing engineer 
need translate research result well demand prediction structure 
ssi enters design process pressure foundation 
need research 
ssi significant context performance base design 
community study ssi shrink due limited funding priority place ssi nsf 
speak one voice make impact nsf like structural control tsunami people 
let create web site advance issue post research finding etc 
design nuclear power plant major stimulus ssi 
since practically new nuclear plant design stimulus vanish 
recent earthquake show high level nonlinear soil broad area 
this nonlinear may lead ssi effect save building 
need investigate 
need dialogue experimentalists analyst 
additional ssi research seismic earth pressure retain wall consider non linear aspect gap 
comparative study non linear linear ssi evaluate non linear analysis important 
more work need pile foundation 
for example observed damage pile due soil displacement suggest need consider soil displacement structural inertia designing pile 
how two action superimpose vital importance 
more work need underground structure tunnel pipeline 
how estimate degree nonlinear soil effect 
need work flexible foundation 
more work need do seismic soil pressure wall ssi involve first mode period lengthen ratio due interaction ground motion variability 
the load paths inertial load especially near ground line need consider 
nonlinear ssi may important severe earthquake 
need simple model nonlinear ssi recently get accustom ground motion 
pushover become common need properly account ssi analysis especially near failure state 
movement towards performance base design need understand uncertainty 
there need ssi research near field ground motion 
such effect may localize 
from geotechnical point view important issue damage pile soil boundary significantly grind surface due lateral flow 
before liquefaction soil fairly elastic strain important determine soil property 
after liquefaction soil behaves liquid 
need distinguish liquefy non liquefied soil ssi formulation 
energy absorption liquefy soil significant add extra damping 
level energy dissipation depend liquefaction occurs time history 
liquefaction help much occur late 
there evidence wildlife liquefaction site see holzer youd hank dynamic liquefaction superstition hill california earthquake science 
need concerned story building subject near field pulse 
the long period energy content motion mean period lengthen would increase base shear 
there need address future engineering activity large uncertainty associate ssl know earthquake motion random soil property random local motion spatial variation random etc 
objective need future approach aspect consistently use probabilistic model 
addition improve seismic design costly retrofit highway concrete bridge essential probabilistic ssi analysis try calibrate deterministic design base risk assessment comparison 
therefore important nsf envisions need future 
well field observation general success experimental work use observe data 
these summarize three way lotung type experiment good instrumentation specific type structure lots comparison theory experiment depth study typical building structure study many building look trend easily understand many engineer 
stewart thesis stewart stewart analysis soil structure interaction effect build response earthquake strong motion recording sit report ucb eerc richmond 
however still great need develop improve current field observation system system well enable experimental verification analytical procedure europe research verifying ssi provision eurocode 
interpretation available field data additional instrumentation obtain proper ssi response data 
instrument building inadequate vertical sensor calculate rock effect case physically possible additional free field instrument downhole accelerographs deploy 
evaluation influence free field displacement pile 
understand soil pressure foundation element basement wall 
more work need do seismic soil pressure wall 
need reliable experimental data verification simple analysis scheme 
transfer knowledge there big gap state art knowledge practicing engineer 
therefore necessary simply able demonstrate practice engineer ssi important 
simple practical tool procedure need transfer knowledge practice engineer 
effort make include ssi building code 
effort make incorporate ssi methodology favorite computer software sap 
effort make demonstrate profession usefulness incorporate ssi design 
the design engineer appraise fact incorporation ssi procedure case financially beneficial 
there considerable research pile foundation 
however great need translate accumulate knowledge practice 
there significant need knowledge transfer issue damp 
graduate student need taught ssi help bridge gap researcher practitioner 
all grad student qualify exam ssi question 
need practical tool agree upon computer code 
the data use calibrate design code 
rather need understand simple problem well develop good code formulation design base insight gain simple model 
instrumentation need detail enough guide process 
data exchange between japan this vital importance researcher side 
example professor iguchi write book along author ssl two thousand copy book distribute japan lecture engineer 
the side may desire book translate 
there impressive experiment japan ssi need become familiar 
recommend good information exchange japan japanese experimental data extremely valuable must relate available theoretical model 
perhaps could contribute expertise effort 
other issue ssi practice push code 
case industry use 
thus necessary teach 
under condition fund agency fund activity 
the code committee receptive ssi 
therefore follow fruition 
need inside advocate nsf usgs get ssi funding 
let speak one voice develop inside advocacy 
also look new funding source insurance industry gas oil company 
fund ssi research increase industry demand ssi 
nuclear industry 1980s

earthquake ground motion take account ssi effect also need 
simulation prediction work either case accumulation densely observe record soil structure system become essential 
particular accumulation many reliable strong motion record establishment methodology extract ssi effect record key capture substantially ssi effect also improve accuracy assessment structural safety intense earthquake 
japan simultaneous earthquake observation building surround soil perform since early 1970s many observe record accumulate far 
these data however scarcely make best use tlie ssi research 
this may due lack methodology isolate ssi effect limit record insufficient observation record extract effect 
furthermore accumulate data limit small medium ground motion strong motion record 
hyogo ken nanbu earthquake certain number simultaneous record observe strong earthquake various site 
base observation number study present ssi effect earthquake 
the objective report summarize ssi research relate recent strong earthquake include hyogo ken nanbu earthquake 
special emphasis place simulation analysis effective input motion structure investigated basis simultaneous observation record structure surround soil earthquake 
addition topic general trend ssi research last ten year japan overview 
describe follow chapter 
overview current trend ssi research japan technical meeting architectural institute japan aij hold every year number paper present meeting 
many scientist engineer graduate student various field build science structural mechanic geotechnical engineering earthquake engineering etc 
gather one place exchange information discussion 
the paper present meet reflect academic interest participant therefore give clue know tendency research japan 
follow current research trend ssi japan overview paper present meeting 
show change number paper ssi present meeting last ten year 
see figure number present paper varies around 
noticed decline number appear several year recover soon hyogo ken nanbu earthquake occur 
though interest ssi unchanged among researcher need extend importance ssi widely young generation well engineer concerned seismic design structure 
show change methodology use ssi analysis 
evidently see figure ssi research relate analytical procedure decline thin layered element method tlm gradually increase contrary 
the analytical solution may less mean consider practical point view play significant roll 
the change number paper present annual meeting aij 
the change methodology use ssi analysis 
benchmark check result obtain numerical procedure 
the exploitation simplify method important mean obtain result easily quickly method use make analytical method 
nevertheless number paper tend decrease regrettably several year 
the exploitation simplify method evaluate 
finally fig 
show change subject ssi research 
clearly see figure gradual increase paper deal pile group contrast decrease paper embed foundation 
also noticed figure hyogo ken nanbu earthquake occur number paper deal pile group increase suddenly 
also note majority paper relate pile group two year 
this due heavy damage pile group earthquake 
time spread recognition importance soil pile structure interaction another reason

small event peak acceleration gal fig 
kushiro oki earthquake gal soil surface 
the observed result compare figure compute two dimensional fem take non linearity soil account 
inspection result indicate small earthquake ratio become small short period less sec kushiro oki event ratio become great wider range sec 
also notice compute result fully explain measured result magnitude strong motion 
recall fact model tend overestimate large value damp coefficient model luco hadjian discrepancy might mainly due employment model instead model 
also notice tendency recognize observed result fig

kurimoto perform simulation analysis story reinforce concrete building take ssi effect account subject observed motion 70m ground surface 
for build accelerometer densely instrumented superstructure also soil yasui 
the peak horizontal acceleration observe ground floor main shock gal gal direction 
the methodology use analysis fem incorporate non linearity soil 
fairly good agreement observe compute presented soil superstructure 
this paper also indicate lateral soil embed foundation become less effective due non linearity soil foundation support firm soil 
prior study fujimori

detailed summary contribution present nazarian hadjian prakash whitman veletsos younan 
the comprehensive previous study elastic response system one present wood wall consider rigid 
present study assumption linear response retain material preserve wall consider flexible 
the objective ass effect flexibility magnitude distribution wall pressure displacement maximum value total wall force base shear overturn moment induce horizontal ground shake 
material present essentially summary important information report series recent contribution author 
system consider show figure system examine consist fix base vertical cantilever wall retain semi infinite stratum uniform viscoelastic material 
the wall consider uniform thickness finite rigidity retain material consider free upper surface bond non deform rigid base 
the base wall stratum presume experience space invariant horizontal motion acceleration time maximum value 
material damp medium wall consider constant hysteretic type 
the property soil stratum define mass density shear modulus elasticity poisson ratio material damping factor consider shear axial deformation 
the factor tan factor use previous study foundation dynamic soil structure interaction twice large damp factor express term critical coefficient damp 
the property wall defined thickness mass per unit surface area young modulus elasticity poisson ratio damp factor like twice large correspond factor express term critical damping value 
figure system consider method analysis the method analysis use describe veletsos younan younan veletsos bandyopadhyay summarize briefly 
fundamental method assumption horizontal excitation consider vertical normal stress develop anywhere medium 
assume horizontal variation vertical displacement medium negligible horizontal shearing stress express horizontal displacement arbitrary point medium relative moving base 
complex value shear modulus 
the reliability assumption confirm veletsos younan compare solution rigid wall obtain wood exact solution 
the step involve analysis follow first horizontal displacement medium relative move base express linear combination natural mode vibration stratum consider act unconstrained vertical cantilever shear beam 
similarly relative displacement wall express linear combination natural mode 
clamp free beam 
these expression satisfy condition zero displacement rigid base zero stress force top boundary 
next differential equation govern motion medium horizontal direction solve subject condition compatible displacement interface medium wall 
for purpose satisfy boundary condition natural mode vibration beam expand term correspond mode retain medium 
the result step medium displacements wall pressure function yet undetermined wall displacement 
finally wall displacement evaluate satisfy dynamic equilibrium force act beam use lagrange equation motion 
the analysis first implement harmonic excitation 
the response arbitrary transient ground motion evaluate fourier transform technique 
presentation result consideration first give response obtain excitation dominant frequency small compare fundamental natural frequency soil wall system 
this tantamount neglect dynamic amplification effect retain medium 
such excitation result effect refer static term confuse normally use represent effect gravity force 
maximum dynamic effect arbitrary excitation express product correspond static effect appropriate amplification deamplification factor 
static effect figure total force base shear per unit wall length induce maximum static value lateral inertia force pst plot function dimensionless measure wall flexibility represent flexural rigidity per unit wall length give 
the result normalized respect pxgh2 
also show distance base line action resultant wall force normalize respect wall height refer effective height represent distance pst must multiply yield static value overturn moment per unit wall length 
the wall solution other follow consider massless poisson ratio retain medium take 
observe flexibility wall affect significantly magnitude wall force line action resultant 
increase wall flexibility reduces horizontal extensional stiffness retain material relative shearing stiffness reduction turn increase proportion inertia force transmit horizontal shear action base decrease proportion transmit wall 
since effective height also decrease increase wall flexibility reduction overturn base moment generally much great correspond shear 
the reduction substantial even rather small value 
for example pst reduce pxgh2 rigid wall pxgh2 system 
the corresponding reduction effective height base moment 565px qpxgh3 
figure normalize value base shear effective height wall static excited system different wall flexibility 
the effect wall flexibility magnitude distribution wall pressure pst show figure 
for rigid wall pressure increase almost quarter sine zero base maximum top whereas flexible wall sharp change intensity pressure near top pressure decrease change sign

this period give 
the wall solution presume massless material damp factor wall retained medium take percent percent critical damping respectively poisson ratio medium take 
the plots figure similar mean non dimension response spectra similarly excite viscous damp single degree freedom system 
specifically low natural period stiff medium indicate peak value dynamic base shear equal corresponding static value 
with increase medium flexibility amplification factor increase attain nearly horizontal plateaus reach value may substantially low unity 
within practically important period range sec amplification factor nearly constant factor relatively small particularly stiffer wall low value 
the average amplification factor within range varies rigid wall wall wall 
these relatively low value due capacity medium dissipate energy radiation wave far field 
the great wall stiffness relative retain medium small great capacity 
ill sec 
amplification factor maximum wall force base shear per unit wall length system different wall flexibility subject centro earthquake record normalize value force 
wall reflect wave impinge dissipate radiation far field 
far insight magnitude maximum dynamic force base shear per unit wall length pmax may gain figure quantity replotted normalized respect common factor pxgh 
four value consider result plot function natural period retain medium 
observe increase reduces dynamic wall force full range reduction large low medium value figure show normalize value effective height seismic excited system examine 
observe height represent distance maximum dynamic wall force base shear must multiply yield correspond base moment insensitive variation accordingly may practical purpose consider value display figure static excite system 
follow dynamic amplification factor base moment may take equal wall force base shear 
these simple relation consequence fact response system basically dominate fundamental mode vibration 
effect wall mass for system examine far wall presumed massless 
the effect wall mass twofold modifies generally decrease wall pressure induce retained medium induces additional force wall 
the net effect generally increase 
magnitude wall force 
precise evaluation effect beyond scope contribution 
however reasonable approximation additional base shear may obtain expression mexg effective wall mass maximum ground acceleration appropriate amplification factor massless wall 
the effective mass may consider decrease total wall mass non deform rigid wall percent total mass wall percent total mass wall 
computation correspond base moment effective height may take equal determine massless wall 
normalize value effective height system different wall flexibility subject centre earthquake record 
conclusion the magnitude distribution wall displacement wall pressure associate force induce horizontal ground shake system examine quite sensitive flexibility wall 
increase flexibility reduces horizontal extensional stiffness retain medium relative shearing stiffness reduction turn decrease proportion soil inertia force get transfer wall hence force develop 
for realistic wall flexibility total wall force base shear may order one half less obtained non deform rigid wall reduction base moment even large 
the reduced effect may well reasonable agreement obtain 
mononobe okabe method 
this agreement however mean constitute validation latter method represent approximate limit state analysis problem 
even centre california earthquake ground motion record maximum wall displacement relative move base realistic wall flexibility find less value percent wall height normally accept minimum require develop limit state retain material

discussion implication energy dissipation ssi seismic design present last section paper 
state practice the state practice model energy dissipation ssi analysis structure nuclear power plant typically follow 
the structural engineer usually perform analysis construct model structure element library commercial software program structural dynamic 
most element library rotational translational spring constant stiffness attach base structural model simulate foundationsoil interaction 
the structural engineer usually consult geotechnical engineer foundation stiffnesses usually request estimate foundation damp 
the structural analysis software typically solve equation motion use modal superposition 
the input motion usually define geotechnical engineer engineering seismologist consist design spectra correspond damp ratio specify structural engineer typically select value aforementioned range 
this practice incorporate ssi effect remain fairly constant last year 
while structural engineer recognize importance include foundation flexibility model reluctance properly incorporate damping system 
most popular commercial structural dynamic software program include viscous damp 
misc ing doc 
even provision specify element damp available program engineer would difficulty specify viscous damp constant element unlike relatively simple method generate element stiffness procedures estimate value system damp matrix complex 
available procedure obscure unknown difficult understand many structural engineer 
until become familiar comfortable procedure usual practice arbitrarily adopt modal damp value around continue 
many structural engineer presently use software nonlinear inelastic dynamic analysis structure 
the hysteretic damping specification load deflection characteristic structural element automatically include structural model damp foundation element difficult specify anelastic hysteretic damping soil frequency dependent radiation damp foundation soil medium 
penultimate section paper simple example provide illustrate calculation modal damp ratio fundamental mode vibration tank foundation system 
even example geotechnical engineer need recognize properly estimate two component foundation damp hysteretic radiation 
composite modal damp the composite modal damp ratio mode vibration soil structure system depend foundation damp structural damp nature degree interaction structure support soil 
the foundation damp consist material hysteretic damping soil radiation damp associate generation propagation seismic wave soil medium motion foundation relative free field earthquake motion 
the material damp primarily depend strain induced soil shake seed idriss whereas radiation damp depend elastic property surround soil shape embed foundation 
for give soil profile foundation geometry radiation damp depends mode foundation vibration vertical translation horizontal translation rotation combination translation rotation richart gazetas 
generally foundation damp high vertical horizontal vibration low rock motion 
however even rock mode damp ratio significantly large nominal critical damping ratio typically assume structure building bridge 
thus foundation damp normally much high structural damping

recent experience importance couple soil foundation structure interaction sfsi dynamic response bridge structure earthquake fully realize 
treat problem two different method use call elasto dynamic method develop practice nuclear power industry large foundation call empirical method develop practice offshore oil industry pile foundation 
each method strong weak characteristic generally opposite thus restrict proper use different type bridge foundation 
combine model two method series form hybrid method develop tseng penzien make use strong feature method minimize weak feature 
while hybrid method may need development validation time fundamentally sound thus expect eventually become standard procedure treat seismic sfsi large bridge support different type foundation 
free field seismic ground motion the first step conduct seismic performance evaluation bridge structure define seismic input couple soil foundation structure system 
design situation input define term expect free field motion soil region surround bridge foundation 
evident precisely characterize motion practically unachievable within present state knowledge seismic ground motion 
therefore necessary use rather simplistic approach generate motion design purpose 
the procedure commonly use design large bridge generate three component two horizontal vertical set accelerograms represent free field ground motion control point select bridge site characterize spatial variation 
free field motion within soil region interest relative control motion 
the control point usually select surface ofbedrock surface firm soil stratum case deep soil site refer herein rock outcrop location select reference pier freefield seismic wave environment within local soil region foundation assume compose vertically propagate plane shear wave horizontal motion vertically propagate plane compression wave vertical motion 
for bridge site consist relatively soft top soil deposit overlie competent soil stratum rock assumption vertically propagate plane wave depth foundation reasonably valid confirm actual field downhole array recording 
the design ground motion bridge normally specify term set parameter value develop select control point include set target acceleration response spectra ar set associate ground motion parameter design earthquake namely magnitude sourceto site distance peak ground rock outcrop acceleration pga velocity pgv displacement pgd duration strong shaking 
for large important bridge parameter value usually establish regional seismic investigation couple site specific seismic hazard ground motion study whereas small bridge customary establish value base generic seismic study result contour regional pga value standard ars curve different general class site soil condition 
for long bridge support multiple pier turn support multiple foundation space relatively far apart spatial variation grind motion among local soil region foundation need also define seismic input 
base result analysis use actual earthquake ground motion recording obtain strong motion instrument array centre differential array california smart array taiwan spatial variation free field seismic motion characterize use two parameter namely apparent horizontal wave propagation velocity speed direction control first order spatial variation ground motion due seismic wave passage effect set horizontal vertical ground motion coherency function quantifies second order ground motion variation due scatter complex three dimensional wave propagation abrahamson 
thus addition design ground motion parameter value specify control motion characterize design seismic input long bridge need include two additional parameter mention namely 
apparent horizontal wave velocity ground motion coherency function therefore seismic input motion develop various pierfoundation location need compatible value specify two additional parameter 
have specify design seismic groundmotion parameter step require establish pier foundation location specific seismic input motion particular bridge develop threecomponent two horizontal vertical set freefield rock outcrop motion time history compatible design target ar associated design ground motion parameter applicable select single control point location bridge site motion refer herein simply response spectrum compatible time history control motion generate response spectrumcompatible time history free field rock outcrop motion bridge pier support location coherency relative correspond component response spectrum compatible motion control point pier support location compatible wave passage parameter coherency function specify site motion refer herein response spectrum coherency compatible rockoutcrop motion carry free field site response analyse pier support location obtain time history free field soil motion specify discrete elevation full depth foundation use correspond response spectrumand coherency compatible free field rock outcrop motion input 
rock outcrop motion control point location give prescribed set target acceleration response spectra ar set associated design ground motion parameter bridge site describe previously objective herein develop threecomponent set time history control motion provide reasonable match correspond target ar time history characteristic reasonably compatible specify associate ground motion parameter value 
past several different method use develop rock outcrop time history motion compatible prescribe set target ar include response spectrum compatibility time history adjustment method source tosite numerical model time history simulation method multiple actual record time history scale method connect accelerogram segment method 
present time first four method consider suitable 
practical bridge engineering application particularly method develop lilhanand tseng base earlier work kaul 
case small local perturbation add systematic manner initial start acceleration time history time correspond occurrence response spectral value 
result phase characteristic wave sequence pattern initial start time history largely maintain 
important therefore initial time history select carefully 
each three component set start accelerograms give bridge site preferably set record past seismic event source mechanism similar control design earthquake magnitude within target control earthquake magnitude close source site distance within target source site distance 
the select recorded accelerograms pga pgv pgd value strong shake duration within range target value specify bridge site represent free field surface recording rock rock like stiff soil site recording soft site use 
for close control seismic event 
within site select accelerograms contain definite velocity pulse call fling 
when recording available method describe previously use generate start set time history appropriate fling modify start set recorded motion include desired directional velocity pulse 
have select three component set starting time history horizontal component transform principal component correspond principal direction evaluate penzien watabe 
these principal component make response spectrum compatible use time domain adjustment procedure describe standard frequencydomain adjustment procedure hao oliviera penzien silva lee bolt gregor 
use latter procedure fourier amplitude spectrum phase spectrum adjust iteratively 
rock outcrop motion bridge support location characterization spatial variation rockoutcrop motion engineering purpose base set wave passage parameter grind motion coherency function 
the wave passage parameter 
currently use apparent horizontal seismic wave speed direction angle relative axis normal longitudinal axis ofthe bridge 
study strong weak motion array data include california taiwan japan show apparent horizontal speed wave direction propagation typically sec range chang abrahamson 
application apparent wave velocity vector show speed direction must project along bridge axis give apparent wave speed direction 
realistic becomes small minimum angle say degree use order account wave arrive direction different specify direction

the notation equation use indicate coefficient complex value contain real imaginary part dependent upon excitation frequency base analysis strong motion array data set generic coherency function horizontal vertical ground motion develop abrahamson 
give three component set responsespectrum compatible time history rock outcrop motion develop select control point location specify set wave passage parameter target coherency function describe response spectrum compatible coherencycompatible multiple support rock outcrop motion applicable pier support location bridge generate use march method develop hao oliveira penzien extend later tseng lilhanand yang 
for long bridge locate close control seismic source attenuation motion distance away control pier location consider 
this achieve scaling generate motion various pier location appropriate scale factor determine appropriate ground motion attenuation relation 
the acceleration time history generate pier 
location integrate obtain corresponding velocity displacement time history check ensure numerically generated baseline drift 
relative displacement time history control pier location successive pier location also check ensure reasonable 
the rock outcrop motion finally obtain use appropriate site response analyse develop corresponding free field soil motion require conduct sfsi analysis pier location 
soil motion bridge support location the seismic input large bridge define term expect free field soil motion discrete elevation entire depth foundation 
such motion must evaluate locationspecific site response analyse use correspond previously describe rock outcrop free field motion input appropriately define soil bedrock model 
usually model base assumption horizontal vertical free field soil motion produce upward downward propagation onedimensional shear compression wave respectively cause upward propagation incident wave underlie rock firm soil formation 
consistent type motion assume local soil medium surround foundation consist uniform horizontal layer infinite lateral extent 
wave reflection refraction occur interface adjacent layer include soiltoedrock interface reflection wave occur soil surface 
computer program shake schnabel idriss sun commonly use carry describe one dimensional type site response analysis 
for long bridge widely vary soil profile end end site response analyse must repeat different soil column representative changing profile 
the cyclic free field soil deformation produce particular bridge site maximum expect earthquake usually nonlinear hysteretic form 
since shake computer program treat linear system soil column analyze must model equivalent linearized manner 
obtain equivalent linearize form soil parameter model modify consecutive linear time history response analysis complete continue convergence strain compatible parameter reach 
generate horizontal freefield motion produce vertically propagate shear wave need equivalent linear soil parameter shear modulus hysteretic damp ratio these parameter function shear strain

the shear modulus give nondimensional form gmax gmax situ shear modulus low strain 
the shear modulus must obtain cyclic shear test gmax obtain use gmax pvs2 mass density soil situ shear wave velocity obtain field measurement 
for generate vertical free field motion produce vertically propagate compression wave need soil parameter low strain constrain elastic modulus pvp2 compression wave velocity correspond damp ratio 
the variation soil parameter compress strain yet well establish 
present time vertical site response analyse generally carry use lowstrain constrain elastic modulus directly strain compatible damp ratio obtain horizontal response analysis limit maximum value without strain compatibility iteration 
for soil submerge water value less compression wave velocity water 
have generate acceleration free field time history motion use shake computer program corresponding velocity displacement time history obtain single double integration acceleration time history 
should unrealistic drift appear displacement time history appropriate correction apply 
should drift appear straight line fashion usually indicate duration specify fourier transform record accelerograms short thus increase duration usually correct problem

such solution obtain analytical form linear damp elastic continuum half space soil medium apsel 
because ofcomplexities analytical solution dynamic green function 
obtain foundation relatively simple soil foundation interface geometry 
rectangular cylindrical spherical soil foundation interface geometry support simple soil medium 
practical application dynamic green function often obtain numerical form base finite element discretization half space soil medium correspond discretization soil foundation interface boundary use computer program sassi lysmer

the use finite element soil model evaluate dynamic green function numerical form advantage foundation arbitrary soil foundation interface geometry easily handle however suffers disadvantage high frequency 
cut frequency motion reliable solution obtain limited size finite element use model soil medium 
have evaluate dynamic green function use procedure describe desired soil impedance matrix obtain inverting frequency frequency soil compliance matrix matrix green function value evaluate specified frequency 
because dynamic green function complex value frequency dependent coefficient result soil impedance matrix also complex value frequency dependent the real part soilimpedance coefficient represent dynamic stiffness soil medium also incorporate soil inertia effect imaginary part coefficient represent energy loss result soil material damp radiation stress wave far field soil medium 
thus soil impedance matrix develop reflect overall dynamic characteristic ofthe soil medium relate motion foundation soil foundation interface 
because presence foundation excavation cavity soil medium vector free field soil motion prescribe soil foundation interface boundary derive seismic input motion free field soil medium without foundation excavation cavity 
the derivation motion vector ita require solution dynamic boundary value problem free field half space soil medium foundation excavation cavity subject specified seismic wave input result solution satisfies stress free condition surface foundation excavation cavity 
thus result seismic response motion ioo reflect effect seismic 
wave scatter due presence cavity 
this scatter effect much important large bridge foundation large caisson group large diameter shaft man foundation small characteristic dimension slender pile group significant foundation support soft soil sit stiff soil site 
the characterization soil impedance matrix utilize elasto dynamic model soil medium describe require soil material characterization constant include mass density shear constrain elastic modulus shear compression wave velocity constant hysteresis damp ratio mention previously soil shear modulus decrease soil hysteresis damp ratio increase function ofsoil shear strain induce free field soil medium due seismic input motion

for convenience late discussion soil impedance matrix characterize use elasto dynamic model denote symbol ico 
empirical model for slender pile group foundation soil nonlinear occur local soil region immediately adjacent pile dominate behavior foundation loading characterization ofthe soil resistance pile deflection often rely empirically derive curve lateral resistance curve axial resistance 
for foundation characterization soil impedance matrix need demand analysis purpose make use secant modulus derive commonly use nonlinear curve 
since development empirical curve base upon static pseudo static test result incorporate soil inertia material damping effect 
thus result soil impedance matrix develop secant modulus curve reflect static soil stiffness soil inertia soil material damp characteristic 
hence soil impedance matrix obtain realvalued constant coefficient matrix applicable zero frequency however function foundation displacement amplitude

the construction curve depend strength parameter stiffness parameter soil medium thus effect global soil nonlinear dynamic stiffness soil medium cause soil shearmodulus decrease soil damp increase function free field motion induce soil shear strain incorporate soil impedance matrix develop curve 
furthermore since curve develop basis result field test free field groundmotion induce soil deformation effect global soil nonlinear soil strength characterization parameter hence curve incorporate 
because small cross sectional dimension slender pile seismic wave scatter effect due presence pile cavity usually negligible thus scattered free field soil input motion case often take free field soil motion cavity present 
hybrid model from discussion two section clear characterization soil foundation interaction force demand analysis purpose achieve use either elasto dynamic model empirical model soil medium merit deficiency

the lotung experiment provide insight ssi response stiff structure fix base frequency order ssi frequency extremely soft soil condition shear wave velocity top layer sec 
the result lotung experiment show response structure mainly rock mode rigid body rotation ssi effect structural deformation seismic wave spatial variation stiffer soil condition address

the shear wave velocity top layer site approximately sec 
some lesson learn lotung experiment instrumentation scheme lotung hualien array use study soil structure interaction regular building structure 
however natural frequency containment structure lotung hualien experiment much high regular building subject ssi experiment discuss herein 
recommendation the workshop recommendation need motivation field experiment implement observe structural behavior 
soil structure interaction ssi effect typical regular building hereinafter refer typical building strong motion earthquake 
this principal recommendation motivate fact still great uncertainty significance seismic soil structure interaction ssi typical structure 
there may beneficial adverse effect soil structure interaction 
however many case ssi simply ignore design without establish whether increase decrease response structure 
the additional detailed recommendation follow provide guideline design experiment activate strong earthquake remove uncertainty 
necessary consider currently know ssi effect realistically observe analyzed current method 
for example know major manifestation ssi contribution rock motion structure perhaps local deformation foundation structure 
thus instrumentation design observe effect 
observation check result numerical calculation much valuable observation comparison cannot make 
thus build foundation system site configuration relatively simple thus need typical regular building 
the motivation ssi experiment itemize improve state art formulation procedures evaluation ssi effect 
provide clear useful guidance ssi incorporate 
analysis building necessary do 
check accuracy numerical prediction ssi particular rock foundation since yet great confidence specific numerical prediction amount rock major contributor ssi 
recommendation site location soil condition the test site locate area relatively high seismic easily accessible installation maintenance instrumentation 
the following area identify usgs high earthquake probability wgcep the san francisco bay area fault san andreas hayward rogers creek southern california upland redlands san bernardino fault san jacinto san andreas 
order ssi effect significant test site soil site rather rock site 
also geometry ground water condition site relatively simple incident wave field well define analyze 
this lead follow recommendation the site shallow 
rock locate appreciable depth 
foot foundation level candidate structure 
firm alluvial site preferable 
such site would consist sand gravel shear wave velocity range fps within 
upper foot site 
the site level essentially horizontally layer 
this critical requirement observation compare analytical result 
the site liquefiable stable ground water level 
detail site investigation perform site select 
the investigation include several boring establish stratigraphy situ shear wave velocity measurement laboratory test undisturbed sample ground water observation 
permanent open space around building must ensure long term observation free field motion 
this requirement must chance satisfied probably high public building choose experiment 
recommendation foundation the foundation system candidate structure simple possible inherently minimize ssi effect 
thus the preferred foundation type stiff box mat foundation 
the contact surface underlie soil approximately plane 
story basement acceptable 
however foundation system fully compensate since tend minimize inertial ssi effect one effect desirable observe 
fully compensate foundation system one weight displace soil equal weight entire structure include basement 
the initial experiment exclude pile support structure 
recommendation superstructure preferable new building construction start identify instrumentation part ssi experiment rather use exist building 
recommend building instrument ssi experiment follow general characteristic the geometry load carry system structure simple regular possible 
build symmetric two ax preferable 
the design build fall within scope current seismic design code 
also amenable accurate analysis 
desirable structure different stiffness two principal direction 
however aspect ratio plan dimension exceed preferably 
furthermore insure reasonable radiation damp building slender 
hand the plan dimension build large cause horizontal wave length interaction 
the structure light since would minimize ssi effect 
reinforced concrete structure steel structure concrete wall preferable 
the fixed base natural period superstructure order second 
this correspond story build depend building type 
possible new yet construct building chosen

recommendation instrumentation several type instrumentation employ record force motion local deformation structure surround soil 
superstructure instrumentation the main instrumentation superstructure digital accelerometer common time base 
enough instrument instal determine translational torsion rocking motion least three level structure include base level top floor 
the exact location instrument determine extensive analytical response study ambient force vibration test structure 
additional sensor instal within structure measure story drift slab deformation several level 
foundation instrumentation addition accelerometer sensor linear variable displacement transducer lvdtj instrument instal record local deformation foundation system 
this especially important foundation mat flexible shear wall found independent foundation 
also desirable able record dynamic contact pressure basement wall foundation slab 
unfortunately currently available pressure cell reliable observation extend several year 
also virtually impossible install exist 
direct record contact pressure may therefore practical 
may however possible certainly desirable install rugged instrument record wall soil separation foundation uplift 
free field instrumentation minimum three boreholes instrument record free field motion 
the boreholes surround instrument building locate far enough away exist plan structure ensure record obtain contaminate ssi effect 
however boreholes far away incoherency effect destroy coherency motion observe different boreholes
