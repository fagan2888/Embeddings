the completion reconnaissance survey two copper belt lie north south wrangell mountain pave way detailed investigation 
southern chitina copper belt first one develop appropriate begin detailed investigation field 
the fund available work make possible survey part chitina belt careful consideration decide take work nizina district 
this conclusion base three consideration the information available indicated nizina district afford best opportunity solve general geologic problem relate entire copper belt mining development part district extensive elsewhere belt give good opportunity observation occurrence ore great promise soon reach productive basis investigation field make possible cover placer district long productive small way give promise large output 
the description set forth report apply onefourth chitina copper belt conclusion advance occurrence ore believe value entire district 
development chitina valley continue expect survey undertaken soon circumstance permit 
the cost detail geologic map much increase fact must precede detailed topographic survey 
the nizina region survey witherspoon result map excellent piece work do adverse condition accompanies report pocket add much value

the nizina distbict alaska the general geology district set forth report bear testimony accuracy observation deduction early vorkers field 
significant fact stratigraphic subdivision suggest oscar kohn pioneer work field find acceptance present analysis geologic sequence 
the important conclusion bear economic geology present fact copper ore body appear occur chiefly along system cross fracture approximately right angle greenstone limestone contact 
these fracture occur along well define fault least one trace long distance 
this may apply entire chitina district worthy consideration prospector 
these investigation also appear indicate copper deposit mean confine immediate vicinity limestone greenstone contact usually suppose 
though promising ore body thus far found occur contact evidence strong miner find considerable distance 
another important fact bring investigation occurrence auriferous deposit kennicott formation jurassic 
this report although far complete report previously publish district mean exhaustive 
with progress mine many fact ascertain make possible definite statement geology mineral deposit

the nizina district alaska 
the copper river region chitina valley part state previously separate pacific coast broad belt mountain nearly mile across range height foot 
this belt broken narrow canyon like valley low copper river influence warm moisture laden air pacific become important factor climate copper chitina basin 
another factor importance still loftier wrangell group mountains north 
the season copper river basin long winter short summer separate still short spring fall 
spring come sooner upper chitina valley copper river valley proper show earlier break ice 
snow go valley bottom middle may lower hill first june enough remain mountain side till first middle july hinder prospecting 
the summer climate resembles northern state late spring 
frost expect middle june middle july first september snow line begin descend mountain side 
after spring break volume water stream particularly feed snow field glacier gradually increase reach maximum themiddle july decrease rapidly cool night come 
the july period high water result increase precipitation warm weather bright sun snow field 
cloudy day always make appreciable difference daily rise glacier stream 
sometimes however river flood unusually heavy rain occasionally winter break water confine glacier 
this take place kennicott glacier early 
during period unusually cold weather outlet subglacial stream know pothole close water back glacier pressure great ice could resist 
the water burst forth new outlet flood kennicott chitina river tear ice pile confusion 
fortunately one freight river new ice form afterward give best sledding ever know freighter chitina 
similar flood cause break out confined water nizina glacier take place year previously 
the high water july make ford nizina river difficult time dangerous difficulty decrease august 
first september end 
temperature low enough allow stand water freeze usual latter part august early september glacier cease active stream clear low 
temperature even zero experience winter snowfall heavy although much less coast 
observation kennicott mouth national creek bonanza mine little mile away foot higher show temperature mine coldest weather always considerably high low camp 
the winter unusual low temperature light snowfall 
resulted condition stream place frozen bottom water break run top froze great thickness 
some call glacier chititu creek thickness foot melt away till early follow july thus seriously interfere placer mining 
such condition common enough streams northern alaska unusual nizina district

origin the copper deposit 
yet possible give satisfactory account origin copper deposit feature history state considerable degree certainty desirable since may value future development work 
history present deposit concern chiefly three problem source copper mineral manner brought present position deposit change take place since deposit 
believe source copper within nikolai greenstone small part derive outside source 
the chief argument favor view widespread almost universal occurrence copper miner al greenstone wherever expose 
this see hundred place part formation west end chitina valley nizina river upper chitina 
wherever fracture greenstone permit water circulate green copper stain apt find 
probably copper originally present form sulphide lava flow exclude possibility also combine mineral rock

noteworthy fact wrangell mountain region one volcanic activity since carboniferous time least although possible establish direct relation copper deposit igneous rock later age nikolai greenstone unreasonable suppose presence heat rock near vicinity may important influence promote circulation greenstone particularly increase solvent power circulating water 
manner deposition believe copper take solution circulate water carry trunk channel deposit condition favorable 
speculation exact chemical change take place doubtful value present knowledge fact attempt 
most frequently deposition take place greenstone formation time copper bear water pass outside greenstone overlie limestone give mineral load 
rule ore body form deposition copper mineral open cavity although opening sufficient permit circulation water necessarily present 
most ore replacement country rock copper sulphide 
the replacement greenstone nearly complete adjacent opening water pass grows less less distance opening increase 
hand limestone ores show complete replacement limestone without outside zone disseminate sulphide 
examination microscope show bornite chalcopyrite usually associate greenstone deposit even bornite ore show chalcopyrite unaided eye 
this fact together manner chalcopyrite scattered bornite might take presumptive evidence bornite derive chalcopyrite secondary enrichment 
this fact alone amount proof seem increase chalcop3 rite depth gain bornitechalcopyrite vein nikolai vein lends weight presumption 
the presence native copper associate chalcocite bornite also point conclusion since native copper usually regard secondary origin 
hand evidence find chalcocite deposit limestone bonanza mine indicate ore body ever anything present 
the copper sulphide appear deposit careful examination ore fail discover presence mineral produce alteration chalcocite 
doubtful secondary enrich ore could form condition prevail 
bonanza mine since opening due joint fracture fill ice also loose talus material mine side ridge 
furthermore break ore limestone inclose ore body climatic condition region proceeds faster oxidation 
the expose ore ridge loose broken ore talus slop show thin film oxidize material surface 
yet thin vein chalcocite limestone even large mass chalcocite almost completely altered azurite avhich show oxidation take place either present condition probably earlier favorable condition possibly late ice advance 
the ore westover claim dan creek intimate mixture chalcocite bornite silicified limestone along frac ture zone 
the copper copper iron sulphide disseminate rock small grain veinlets cut rock 
most disseminated grain chalcocite veinlets large irregular mass mixture chalcocite bornite 
the veinlets later quartz inclose possibly later disseminate grain quartz yet minerais veinlets appear contemporaneous 
these example show unsatisfactory evidence concern nature deposit importance promise great richness copper ores follow surface
