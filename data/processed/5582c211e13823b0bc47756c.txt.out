this volume summarize result field laboratory study concern nature ore alteration process affect 
thirty scientist contribute directly include specialist structural geology sedimentation sedimentary petrology groundwater geology mineralogy nuclear geology crystal chemistry structural crystallography physical chemistry analytical chemistry 
the study aim understanding ore vary point view 
with diversity effort work speculation become restricted empirical experimental fact develop 
thus fact combine modest speculation lead writer volume number important conclusion new certainly well found heretofore concern plateau ore 
among important carnotite similar ore yield great bulk production weathering product different sort primary ore primary ore low valence assemblage predominant type consist vanadium clay mineral together uraninite coffinite montroseite present rock contain organic remains chiefly wood 
the geologic environment chemical course weather process well understood general outline although much detail still lack 
the data conclusion present prove helpful future exploration uranium plateau particularly exploration great depth primary ore 
for example district abundant vanadium associate uranium stratigraphic structural control size tenor primary ore body comparable weather ore body vanadium scarce primary ore body may small richer weather counterpart 
addition many data direct application type uranium deposit represent colorado plateau 
the general pattern oxidation uranium vanadium sufficiently determine apply natural environment although detail structure chemistry may vary widely 
perhaps great value long run establishment nature environment primary ore

zone oxidation 
for example outcrop may almost entirely free uranium former presence may suggest trace oxidize copper mineral 
behind outcrop zone measure usually foot ten foot may find uranyl sulfate carbonate intermix iron oxide oxidize copper mineral 
zone chemical uranium value may differ markedly erratically equivalent uranium inasmuch daughter product radioactive disintegration generally less soluble uranium tend move differentially

therefore reaction uranium vanadium discuss length correspond phosphate arsenate treat implied analogy 
the two major uranium vanadates carnotite tyuyamunite metatyuyamunite lower degree hydration 
the vanadium compound valent vanadium 
because primary oxidizable vanadium mineral apparently montroseite iii oxide neither carnotite tyuyamunite form uranium achieve valence vanadium go way 
various study see part show pitchblende coffinite among first mineral oxidize 
usually uranium reach valence vanadium oxidize vanadium 
consequently stage oxidation give uranium vanadium deposit uranium occur uranium vanadium combine 
little known concern solid phase uranium occur stage 
some specimen examine contain several percent uranium identifiable uranium mineral 
conceivable stage uranium exist amorphous black uo3 although difficult understand hydration give brightly color uo3 hydrate occur seem absent 
also stage uranium readily leachable dilute acid solution precaution take prevent oxidation vanadium vanadium 
numerous speculation could make concern phase contain uranium stage little real evidence available probably defer 
study system involve uo3 v205 k2o h2o uranyl vanadate high vanadiumuranium ratio carnotite tyuyamunite rather wide field stability see part 
possible therefore carnotite tyuyamunite precipitate directly precede solid phase different composition reconstitute decomposition reaction 
the presumed intermediary compound show figure rauvite 
the necessity intermediary together extreme insolubility mineral may explain extreme fineness grain natural carnotite tyuyamunite 
the solubility carnotite normal ground water small perhaps even presence appreciable carbonate 
the solubility tyuyamunite considerably great although quantitative value available 
this difference attribute excellent fit potassium ion position uranyl vanadate sheet 
the calcium ion small potassium ion even though doubly charge bind sheet together equal effectiveness 
good parallel draw uranyl vanadate phosphates arsenate ordinary clay mineral 
the cation hold exchange position 
clay potassium calcium hold firmly whereas sodium magnesium easily exchange 
therefore even presence abundant calcium sodium small amount potassium ion solution preferentially take interlayer position form carnotite carnotite widespread extremely important ore mineral even environment calcium ion concentrate potassium ground water 
hand great deal yellow powdery material probably call carnotite fact tyuyamunite 
the low solubility carnotite earthsurface condition show presence equilibrium uranium daughter product bulk sample carnotite bearing ore

furthermore lead uranium age many carnotite bearing sample good agreement contain pitchblende show oxidation place without migration 
hand near outcrop generally zone active entrance water evaporation uranium vanadium ores appear possible considerable movement uranium may occur

latter oxidation would take place water table former 
air percent weight oxygen thus would require pound air complete oxidation breathe moist air process

thus final oxidation air give volume ore would change time 
hand oxidation occur water table agency air saturate water liter water would require per ton ore solubility air water milliliter per liter oxygen content milliliter per liter

for example ore layer foot thick composition assume occurred water table oxidation take place air dissolve ground water drain downward ore cubic foot water would drain square foot surface oxidize ore completely illustrated 
the source water condition show would rain

under circumstance ore would oxidize sequentially direction water movement 
each linear foot ore oxidize would require linear foot water flow

the degree oxidation depend upon many factor time since exposure proximity land surface permeability blanket rock structural attitude enclose rock local rainfall specific mineralogy occurrence unweathered ore

but descend erosion surface approach ore series change set little information available 
the effect zone capillary water movement must drastic especially semiarid area water sink rain evaporate back surface
