water quality lake waramaug and surround watershed litchfield county connecticut kenneth kulp david grason abstract lake waramaug watershed western connecticut sample march march develop information lake management plan 
nutrient enrichment degrade lake water quality result increased algal population recent year 
chemical analysis surface water inflow ground water inflow atmospheric deposition watershed indicate surface water inflow northeastern corner lake major source nutrient discharge lake 
atmospheric deposition contains milligrams per liter total phosphorus milligram per liter total nitrogen 
during month period investigation atmospheric deposition contribute pound nitrogen pound phosphorus lake watershed 
nutrient concentration ground water relatively low total phosphorus range milligram per liter 
lake bottom material contain high concentration nitrogen phosphorus seem release hypolimnion anaerobic condition develop 
these anaerobic condition exist hypolimnion summer lake develop strong thermal stratification 
the ultimate fate nutrient determine although nitrogen phosphorus seem confine hypolimnion summer stratification 
during summer dominant phytoplankton lake bluegreen algae 
during spring fall golden brown algae dominant phytoplankton 
severe algal bloom occur lake investigation 
introduction lake waramaug western connecticut increase algal population recent year indicative nutrient enrichment 
norvell frink identify lake one accelerate eutrophication occur past year

general stream along northeastern shore lake high nutrient concentration high algal growth potential value 
lake waramaug brook large stream enter lake flow area large stream source nutrient discharge lake 
site locate general area consistently high phosphorus concentration 
large fraction phosphorus dissolve form readily available use algae 
this reflect high algal growth potential record site 
although stream small contribution nutrient lake significant 
site locate along steep slope lake eastern shoreline low specific conductance value characteristic value record atmospheric deposition sample 
nutrient concentration low site seem nutrient contribution inflow small result directly precipitation 
nutrient contribution stream discharge western finger lake generally low although site occasionally moderate algal growth potential value 
because area lake relatively shallow approximately foot isolate arrow point nutrient load stream particularly may significant local impact

nutrient data table show phosphorus often nitrogen concentration usually high near lake bottom 
this evident summer lake stratify 
observe turnover april october 
the nutrient concentration begin increase near bottom lake june 
they continue increase early september begin decrease rapidly 
the june increase probably due reduce reaction take place bottom sediment anaerobic condition release nutrient surround water 
because lake stratify time little mixing water take place nutrient make available support algal growth near lake surface 
this reflect nutrient concentration water near surface lake appear react independently concentration bottom water period 
surface nutrient concentration summer grow period probably control great extent precipitation inflows mix level lake 
stratification begin break september mix take place nutrient rich water near bottom reach surface 
this produce marked decrease nutrient concentration bottom increase concentration surface 
algal population lake varied growing season 
golden brown algae chrysophyta predominate april blue green algae cyanophyta predominate mid may continue throughout summer 
they replace golden brown algae euglenoid euglenophyta october 
notable change predominant algal type concurrent spring fall turnover lake 
this may relate release silica bottom sediment surface lake turnover 
silica essential growth certain golden brown algae particular diatom 
the change dominance algal type may also control nitrogen concentration 
the change may june occur conjunction sharp decrease surface nitrogen concentration 
blue green algae capable use atmospheric nitrogen place high nitrogen concentration water essential type algae 
the decrease nitrogen concentration would thus impede production algal type effect blue green algae 
late september october nitrogen concentration increase surface water dominance revert back golden brown algae along euglenoid 
serious algal bloom observe sampling period lake say good year local resident 
summary data collect march march indicate major source nutrient lake surface water inflow northeastern corner lake lake waramaug brook large single contributor 
the high nutrient concentration occur stream period high flow 
bacteriological data surface water inflow frequently indicate high level fecal contamination primarily nonhuman source 
atmospheric deposition lake watershed contains total phosphorus total nitrogen may significant source nutrient lake 
during period april november atmospheric deposition contribute nitrogen phosphorus lake watershed 
ground water lake seepage appear contribute significant quantity nutrient lake although thorough study ground water flow quality necessary confirm 
bottom material deep section lake contain high concentration nutrient organic carbon finer size shallower site lake 
general lake bottom material contain high concentration nutrient 
lake waramaug find develop strong thermal stratification summer month anaerobic condition exist hypolimnion period 
nutrient lake also find concentrate specific level stratification 
the high nutrient concentration locate near lake bottom possibly release nutrient bottom material anaerobic condition 
these nutrient appear mix water level lake fall turnover 
blue green algae predominate lake summer golden brown algae predominate spring fall 
lake morphology probably contributes lake history local algal bloom northwestern finger although significant bloom observe period study
