their study show pumice erupt 
captain john fremont early explorer oregon territory record mount rainier erupt november journal give detail

why glacier 
frequently hear question why glacier mount rainy 
glacier form wherever snowfall repeatedly exceed melting period year 
above foot mount rainy foot snow fall winter melt next winter 
the survival snow one year next depend partly cool temperature high altitude perhaps also somewhat deep snowfall 
line mark limit mountain snow persist one winter next call annual snowline line glacier call firnline fig 
above firnline snow fall year pack change glacier ice air slowly force 
this part glacier accumulation two ice stream meet form half mile wide cowlitz glacier 
one head flank volcano ingraham glacier summit 
the firnline short distance junction glacier 
the high bare embankment extreme right lateral moraine form year ago glacier thicker mile longer 
little tahoma peak 
area snow fall year lose melting 
below firnline ablation area melt predominates 
the firnline mount rainier glacier well foot recent year 
but glacier extend altitude foot far ablation area 
they slowly flow downhill 
solid ice flow slide hard bedrock glacier slip along innumerable surface within ice crystal make glacier 
the rate flow rate ablation govern distance glacier extend ablation zone 
rate remain fairly constant glacier balance size year year 
but change weather pattern affect rate ablation accumulation glacier either become small grow large 
the change likely notice position glacier terminus may either recede advance precise measurement upper reach glacier also show volume change may affect glacier terminus many year ever 
crevasse glacier awesome feature constant hazard climber 
they form adjacent part glacier move different speed 
some mount rainy glacier may flow speed several thousand foot per year along center much slow rate along margin 
this unequal rate flow produce stress ice cause break 
group crevasse often form glacier flow steep place bed 
the ice move faster pull apart crevasse form 
although large crevasse may seem bottomless observer crevasse less foot deep ice pressure tend close open space ice depth1 
ice cover square mile park today 
individual glacier make ice blanket place three group depend place origin 
those one group originate volcano summit flow far valleys radiate cone

work habit glacier glacier extremely capable worker 
their work include erosion transportation deposition 
the smooth groove bedrock box canyon many point along trail ice cave near paradise park show erosion rock glacier ice 
rock fragment carry glacier cut groove hard bedrock polish surface fig 
although one rock fragment might scrape away millimeter rock along single groove total effect great multiply countless thousand similar fragment rasp bedrock surface hundred thousand year 
glacier ice may also break chunk rock loose override may even plow section soft rock

avalanche mudflows like describe normal event mount rainier expect happen future 
almost cliff volcano produce large rockfall cliff collapse next cannot predict 
should volcano become active earthquake volcanic explosion would trigger avalanche mudflows would rush mountain 
molten rock would melt snow ice volcano summit send flood water volcano flank 
these indirect effect eruption would much hazardous lava flow pumice eruption scale similar past year 
the volcano future 
active volcano change continually 
repeat eruption build cone pile one lava flow top other top volcanic formation 
simultaneously combine process erosion wear volcano 
the relative importance two process one building destroying reflect volcano shape 
the scarred deeply gouge side rainier cone show erosion dominant long time 
mount rainier doom continued piecemeal destruction lofty cone reduce featureless mound 
will future eruption lava restore volcano bulk 
volcano erupt violently day collapse mount mazama form deep basin crater lake 
the answer may know century may appear tomorrow
