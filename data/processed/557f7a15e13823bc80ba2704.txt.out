the amount water withdrawn ground water reservoir without cause excessive permanent lowering water table depend upon capacity amount recharge 
ground water reservoir 
water pump ground water reservoir great average rate average rate recharge water level decline supply eventually deplete 
recharge nonpumping period replaces pump water discharge exceed average rate recharge short period time without cause serious lowering water level 
way aquifer could use storage reservoir water could add water could withdraw 
develop maximum amount ground water valley fill water must pump excess rate recharge grow season
