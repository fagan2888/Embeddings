here develop theory visual detection pelagic habitat predict giant eye unlikely evolve detect mate prey long distance instead uniquely suit detect large predator sperm whale 
also provide photographic documentation eyeball pupil giant squid predict depth would allow detection sperm whale distance exceed with long range vision giant squid get early warning approach sperm whale 
because sonar range sperm whale exceeds hypothesize well prepared powerful evasive response hunt sperm whale may drive evolution huge dimension eye body giant colossal squid 
our theory also provide insight vision mesozoic ichthyosaurs unusually large eye 
result animal eye range diameter numerous small specie soccer ball sized eye giant squid 
among vertebrate large eye find whale large ﬁsh 
eye diameter blue whale humpback whale sperm whale reach respectively 
fish generally eye exceed diameter swordﬁsh 
remarkably eye giant colossal squid genus architeuthis mesocychoteuthis reach two possibly even three time diameter large eye animal 
there many anecdotal report huge eye giant squid actual measurement indicate eye diameter 
eye size fundamental factor determine visual performance 
with large eye house large pupil diffraction blurring reduce high ﬂux photon allow small contrast detect 
but large eye expensive build maintain may increase drag hamper camouﬂage 
these cost must offset correspondence dan nilsson biol 
good performance large eye 
this reason suggest giant squid need huge eye visual task unique importance performance task strongly depend eye size 
the pelagic habitat unique visual world downwelling daylight bioluminescence make object visible homogeneous background 
because absorption scatter water contrast object background drop dramatically distance effectively create bubble visibility around observer 
anything prey size large see within bubble large chance important either threat potential food sex 
major challenge vision pelagic habitat detect object distance great enough exploit potential opportunity beneﬁcial behavioral response 
here report new well document measurement eye size giant colossal squid develop mathematical theory explain deep sea squid may need giant eye animal well eye third size small 
conﬁrmation eye size giant colossal squid search reliable data eye size large deep sea squid fortunate obtain photograph freshly catch giant squid architeuthis 
pupil diameter could reliably determine entire eyeball least figure 
also access adult colossal squid mesonychoteuthis hamiltoni new zealand determine eye diameter 
the colossal squid large individual ever catch mantle width giant squid figure indicate adult individual 
there thus reason believe eye diameter close maximum eye size architeuthis mesonychoteuthis 
the signiﬁcantly large value give author likely exaggeration 
but even cannot conﬁrm eye diameter much large still three time diameter large ﬁsh eye reveal huge leap eye size giant squid animal 
eye serve roughly type visual task remarkable difference eye diameter would hardly expect 
giant colossal squid share pelagic depth number large vertebrate whose eye fraction size squid 
this strongly indicate giant colossal squid use eye purpose share animal 
theory our aim identify main selective pressure underlie adaptive advantage uniquely large eye deep sea squid 
approach problem develop mathematical expression relate eye size visual performance range vision relevant type object light condition

develop relationship expression ocean light water property eye geometry visual optic photoreceptor property derive equation relate pupil diameter maximum detection distance range vision 
the solution develop separately detection point source black extended object luminous extend object 
the resulting equation derivation note numerical value use model found supplemental information 
model visual range the theory turn powerful general tool analyze visual strategy pelagic habitat 
strike result range vision irrespective depth sea view direction follow law diminish return eye increase size figure 
this phenomenon depend absorption scatter water unique aquatic vision 
the different visual strategy detection point source black extended object luminous extended object follow slightly different curve result gradually decrease performance gain eye grows large 
increase eye size give markedly good vision pupil diameter 
further increase eye size become gradually much less reward offer good explanation pelagic animal general 
pupil diameter exceed 
with typical ratio focal length pupil diameter aquatic eye correspond eye diameter agree upper bound eye diameter ﬁsh 
our model clearly demonstrate different detection strategy vary depth sea figure 
shallow water extend object best detect dark silhouette bright space light 
but deep water object see long range reverse contrast object trigger plankton bioluminescence move water 
detection individual point source ineffective bright daylight shallow water become competitive strategy darkness moderate great depth sea 
however situation complex indicated figure relative merit different view strategy also depend eye size object size view direction illustrate figure 
under condition point source detection provide long visual range except shallow depth detection dark silhouette superior especially upward view direction background brightest 
the notable feature set large eye apart superior detect large luminous object depths the reason visual contrast long range extremely low require large pupil area summation large target generate statistically detectable difference object background 
thus large eye giant squid offer unique advantage long range detection bioluminescence trigger large move object 
pelagic animal impact vision ﬁtness likely determine detection distance rather water volume eye monitor 
this plotted figure reveals deeply extend source view offer best performance detection predators luminous object pupil diameter exceed 
selection drive detection strategy may thus favor even large eyes animal already eye substantial size 
analyze much pay increase eye size calculated increase visual performance generate fractional increase eye size 
the result summarize figure reveal visual strategy provide best return eye growth coincide rather well best perform visual strategy figure 
for large eye extend view luminous object thus best visual strategy detect large predator deep water figure also strategy strongly motivate increase eye size 
the function figure show performance return increase eye size eye pupil one pupil uniquely high task detect object much large squid predator width 
for conspeciﬁc size object bioluminescent point source performance return less half good prey size extend object less times good detection large predator size object 
extend source view predator size luminous object thus offer unique motivation huge eye search 
general interpretation calculation dim light vision water low resolution task motivate much large eye high resolution task 
because model relies assumption large number variable cannot trust calculation 
why giant squid have giant eye 
entirely faithful real condition 
however sensitivity analysis see supplemental information reveals 
result critically sensitive even substantial variation 
assume value law diminish 
turn well motivation large eye hold even 
signiﬁcantly different input value 
the variable likely 
critically different assumption density biolumi

cence advantage giant eye would diminish 
different detection strategy pelagic vision analyze theoretical consequence target detection pelagic world ﬁnding limit condition discrimination signal target pixel background pixel 
compare different case point source detection stimulate bioluminescence background dark object leave extend source detection right object background space light without stimulate bioluminescence 
maximum detection distance range vision plot pupil diameter show function different detection strategy different depth follow similar law diminish return eye performance increase eye size 
all plots ﬁgure figure calculate clear oceanic water blue water see supplemental information detail

here calculate pupil size giant squid obvious detection extend dark target large small superior strategy upper ocean whereas stimulate bioluminescence generate large move target small one offer long range vision depth depth calculation predict stimulate 
discussion our calculation clearly indicate small eye range vision increase dramatically eye size eye already large range vision improve much increase eye size 
this law diminish return figure cause absorption scatter light water offer plausible explanation eye ﬁsh exceed diameter pupil diameter 
record hold swordﬁsh head large enough house much large eye support conclusion law diminish return rather space constraint prevent development even large eye 
the eye whale generally small compare body size extremely thick sclera characteristic whale eye may account third diameter 
this make eye blue whale optically small swordﬁsh 
agreement law diminish return eye aquatic vertebrate thus display upper bound eye diameter pupil 
although theory point speciﬁc optimal maximal eye size absence eye large swordﬁsh contrast rich representation specie cover every eye size swordﬁsh suggest cost eye large generally compensate gradually small beneﬁt gain increase eye size 
the existence much large eye giant colossal squid three time diameter swordﬁsh eye would make much sense squid use eye purpose swordﬁsh animal small eye 
give giant colossal squid reach weight similar large swordﬁsh eye proportionally much large squid 
although squid specie generally large eye body size allometric growth factor small squid make eye giant colossal squid unusually large even squid 
object meter across would significance giant squid course sperm whale know stomach content important predator giant squid 
when sperm whale dive search squid swim continuously trigger bioluminescence balance darkness black target counter illumination render target invisible extended object still detectable individual point source

detection strategy offer best visual performance best return response increase eye size best detection strategy dependence depth sea target size view direction two pupil diameter 
the color indicate best detection strategy blue point source detection dark gray detection extend black target red detection extend luminous target 
the best detection strategy simply one provide long visibility range depth type target 
the circle divide upper low quarter upward downward view two middle quarter horizontal view 
because biological mean absolute target size depend size viewer use relative target width scale pupil diameter pupil prey conspeciﬁc predator for small eye target proportionally small 
the feature qualitatively set giant eye apart ability use extend source vision detect luminous predator size object long range deep water 
example curve use ﬁnding best detection strategy horizontal view depth 
visual performance axis calculate monitored water volume rather visual range use figure 
point source detection clearly best strategy eye pupil diameter increase eye size predator size object rapidly become much well detect extended luminous object vertical dash line indicate pupil diameter 
illustration performance return generate increase eye size 
for pupil data show also would essentially identical diagram pupil pupils result gradually approach condition show pupil 
there strike correlation best performance best return growth 
the derivative function show pupil diameter extend source detection superior predator detection strategy gain twice much increase eye size detection strategy target size 
the value plot calculated derivative function like precisely relative gain detection range divide relative increase pupil diameter 
the value axis thus indicate proportion detection range increase eye allow grow small fraction 
color code different curve figure black trace black extended target omit rise noticeably ax 
bioluminescence small organism disturb giant colossal squid huge eye see light distance area sufﬁcient bioluminescence 
for particular task law diminish return replace superior performance gain increase eye size range pupil diameter figure 
for visual task detection prey conspeciﬁcs huge eye offer marginally good performance compare small much economic eye 
strong argument point source detection provide main selective advantage large eye isolate point source long range figure would biologically irrelevant large aggregation point source extend source detection efﬁcient figure 
earlier modeling also conclude efﬁcient point source detection require modest eye size 
thus conclude likely explanation unusually large eye giant colossal squid unique ability detect large predator trigger plankton bioluminescence move water 
pelagic bioluminescence however extremely patchy large variation abundance intensity 
bioluminescent organism 
the advantage giant eye long range detection large predator clearly exist long squid stay location bioluminescent plankton reasonably abundant 
but possible squid actively position area may likely encounter food improve chance detect approach predator 
such preference would also increase chance encounter mate 
however signiﬁcant level spontaneous bioluminescence virtually nonexistent bioluminescence rich area may difﬁcult ﬁnd visually unless disturb large animal 
also body constitution giant colossal squid suggest ambush predator continuously motion would normally trigger much plankton bioluminescence 
long detection range implies huge water volume around squid monitor predator million assume sphere deﬁned visual range 
sperm whale contrast likely rely sonar detect squid 
their sonar range couple hundred meter detect small squid presumably longer detect large prey 
squid deaf high frequency sonar 
why giant squid have giant eye 
click toothed whale leave vision option detect distant approaching predator 
despite huge eye giant colossal squid thus unlikely spot sperm whale reveal whale sonar 
this argument imply main advantage giant eye able move whale detection range rather provide enough time prepare effective evasive response 
the large body require build sustain propel pair soccer ball size eye may also offer enough physical power beneﬁt early visual warning allow suitably time forceful escape behavior 
thus possible predation large toothed whale generate combined selection drive evolution gigantism body eye squid 
group extinct marine reptile ichthyosaurs animal know eye similar size giant squid 
contrary previous belief argument suggest also ichthyosaurs giant eye adaptation low resolution task dim light 
but ichthyosaur ecology clearly must differ giant squid 
ichthyosaur build ambush predation body suggest capable sustain high speed cruise much like presentday swordﬁsh 
unfortunately fossils indicate whether day night active thought dive mesopelagic depth 
general conclusion model large ichthyosaur eye diameter like giant squid eye significant selective advantage detection large extend target dim light 
for visual task much small less energetically expensive eye perform almost well 
ichthyosaur live mid triassic mid cretaceous long ﬁrst whale evolve would presumably use large eye spot large object 
interestingly giant pliosaurs live sea much period ichthyosaur genera kronosaurus rhomaleosaurus massive apex predator may pose threat ichthyosaur 
some large eyed ichthyosaur massive animal temnodontosaurus suggest possibility see dim light crucial importance 
our modeling figure offer least support development huge eye spot prey 
this argument support laterally point eye lack aphakic gap improve forward vision temnodontosaurus judge circular sclerotic ring 
seem likely visual target main interest giant ichthyosaur could appear direction 
the computational approach vision introduce paper useful reveal possible reason exceptionally large eye squid ichthyosaur also investigate numerous aspect visual ecology aquatic habitat 
for depth largely inaccessible human model visual performance offer unique way investigate animal interact visually specialize visual system different detection strategy 
the theoretical framework develop adapted approach question visual ecology aquatic habitat bathypelagic freshwater pond
