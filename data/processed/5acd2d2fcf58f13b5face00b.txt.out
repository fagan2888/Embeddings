how nervous system evolve 
what come ﬁrst neuron synaptic protein 
new paper study pancake shape trichoplax suggests neuron 
erik jorgensen something bad must happen around million year ago ediacaran period see 
rise complex unfamiliar look multicellular marine life form end extinction wipe creature 
unfortunately event obscure view 
current biology vol r656 
evolution ﬁrst nervous system 
know ediacaran animal must nervous system leave tracks tunnel thus could move active organize fashion 
but leave directly recognizable successor infer ﬁrst nervous system arise 
the cambrian explosion follow give rise familiar animal phylum 
examination genome suggest nervous system arise perfect state key molecular component nervous system conserve genome animal ion channel use excitable cell extensive repertoire neurotransmitter synaptic machinery 
fact level neurotransmitter system human nervous system look like simpliﬁed version primordial nervous system 
how basic unit nervous system neuron arise 
what come ﬁrst 
synaptic protein specialize anatomy neuron 
what ﬁrst neurotransmitter 
what kind behavior mediate 
last year evidence arisen primitive soft body creature around today include odd little trichoplax might offer glimpse pre cambrian life 
new study smith colleague issue current biology describes anatomy trichoplax unprecedented detail demonstrates complicate repertoire cell unfamiliar bizarre 
pre cambrian animal last year genomes insigniﬁcant creature planet complete porifera ctenophore placozoans 
these animal soft body presumably sit base animal tree life though exact relationship rest animal still contentious 
the creature phyla quite simple soft body lack three germ layer lack true gut 
but coordinate cell move contract 
these phylum may representative precambrian animal life could provide insight ancient origins nervous system 
the sole representative placozoans trichoplax mere 
speck animal 
originally discover crawl glass ﬁsh tank contain seawater 
it simple circular body plan diameter describe time organism largely forgotten thereafter rediscovery 1970s 
can dog trick 
sure essential one pancake trichoplax glide along surface implies coordination beat cilium 
moreover come across patch algae pause food source presumably digest secrete enzyme onto ventral surface absorption via microvilli 
trichoplax also change shape circular elongate disk sometimes 
evidence nervous system underlying behavior 
now work smith 
full understand anatomy w50 cell trichoplax become available 
trichoplax resembles sandwich compose two epithelial layer loose cell gut muscle neuron instead six specialized cell type 
move mean cilia cover ventral surface 
combine previous genome sequence data study suggest gene nervous system present neuron 
pre cambrian proteins what important gene understand nervous system evolution 
recently genome representative specie phyla porifera ctenophora placozoa trichoplax sequence 
all three phylum encode component fast synaptic transmission voltage gate ion channel specialize snare protein mediate synaptic vesicle fusion 
importantly genome also encode complexin snare bind protein may interrupt constitutive fusion vesicle introduce regulatory step 
but key protein synaptic function synaptotagmin calcium bind protein drive regulate vesicle fusion 
the homolog synaptotagmin ctenophore sponge closely related synaptic version 
thus clear calcium dependent vesicle fusion take place sponge ctenophore 
contrast trichoplax 
protein closely related synaptic synaptotagmin thus perhaps trichoplax exhibit true synaptic behavior 
calcium activate vesicle fusion 
surprisingly ctenophores possess panexin gap junction proteins allow rapid communication cell direct electrical conductance 
all three phylum placozoa porifera ctenophora lack pentameric ligand gate ion channel altogether therefore show evidence fast neurotransmission acetylcholine serotonin dopamine gaba glycine 
possible variant eventually find draft genome sequence fully assemble 
but lack classical neurotransmitter receptor support lack vesicular transporter acetylcholine monoamine gaba glycine nucleotide 
these protein make sophisticated nervous system provide excitatory inhibitory input diversity neurotransmitter response complicate network primitive animal deprive access toolkit 
what ﬁrst fast neurotransmitter 
probably glutamate base absence candidate 
the genome three phylum encode subunit glutamate receptor family 
fact transmission use receptor may quite elaborate organism ctenophore pleurobrachia bachei encodes different ionotropic glutamate receptor 
however remain see whether receptor form glutamate gate ion channel reason doubt 
only trichoplax protein weakly similar vesicular glutamate transporter sponge ctenophore homologs related sialic acid transporter sialin 
thus molecule activate receptor may glutamate give absence synaptotagmin ortholog even clear transmission sponge ctenophore fast 
pre cambrian cell base genomic data appear primitive organism true component synaptic transmission pancake shape trichoplax

posse cellular component recognizable nervous system 
light new work smith 
answer resounding 
grossly trichoplax compose two epithelial layer endoderm gland musculature recognizable nervous system 
use cut edge method preserve cell search evidence neuron synapsis 
speciﬁcally use high pressure freeze preserve tissue thus avoid substantial artifact cause slow aldehyde ﬁxation dehydration view stun nothing resemble typical nervous system axon synapsis 
nevertheless author ﬁnd evidence specialized cell simple creature six different cell type identiﬁed 
ventral surface three cell type ventral epithelial lipophil gland cell 
the cell low surface ciliated provide glide motility 
these cell also cover shag carpet microvilli serve external stomach digest algae grow substrate 
the dorsal surface cover thin epithelium 
between ventral dorsal surface rare crystal cell loose collection ﬁber cell 
the bizarre cell crystal cell 
they find margin animal figure epithelial cell layer 
each contain specialize organelle contain crystal polarize light 
be eye 
there report trichoplax responds light opsin encode genome 
but crystal cell look like neuron ultrastructure anything see matter stain antibody snare protein would require secretory communication cell 
the ﬁber cell also intrigue 
since long process reach among cell one could imagine predecessor neuron muscle cell 
indeed express p2x purine activate ion channel might therefore receive excitatory input 
however contact cell lack evidence synaptic specialization process lack contractile apparatus despite presence muscle myosin 
moreover cell express specialize snare protein use synapsis 
antibody stain synaptic snare instead highlight gland cell 
the gland cell like ventral epithelial cell ciliated therefore contribute locomotion 
feed animal pause patch algae make possible cilium use locomotion perhaps also sense food 
gland cell also contain potential secretory vesicle vesicle even appear dock plasma membrane 
but cell orient toward ventral surface make possible cell secrete material onto substrate aid either locomotion digestion rather mediate cell cell communication 
alternatively course gland cell may bona ﬁde neurosecretory cell release fast act neurotransmitter onto cell 
there three potential neurotransmitter encode genome trichoplax neuropeptide fmrfamide purinergic transmitter atp classical neurotransmitter glutamate 
smith colleague demonstrate gland cell express neuropeptide fmrfamide 
organism neuropeptides activate metabotropic receptor fast act ion channel 
but invertebrate fmrfamide also activate ion channel asic family 
trichoplax particularly rich collection gene encode asic channel family member introduce possibility fast neurotransmission trichoplax act via peptide gate ion channel rather classical neurotransmitter gate ion channel 
the gland cell could also use glutamate atp neurotransmitter genome encodes subunit ionotropic glutamate p2x purinergic receptor 
glutamate atp release vesicle must vesicular transporter 
the glutamate nucleotide transporter encode slc17 family anion transporter 
the trichoplax genome encode orthologs conserve glutamate atp transporter encode several slc17 anion transporter one other may load molecule secretory vesicle 
trichoplax adhaerens 
micrograph trichoplax partially polarize light 
crystal cell appear white dot around edge 
the dark granule center inclusion ﬁber cell 
photo carolyn smith 
there one somewhat disturb possibility glutamate neurotransmitter trichoplax possess primitive nervous system use classical neurotransmitter 
the sole evidence glutamate act transmitter presence ionotropic glutamate receptor 
but receptor may simply relay presence nutritive signal algae amino acid 
glutamate activation gland cell could direct movement toward food source 
model amino acid evolve become predominant classical neurotransmitter originally extrinsic molecule signal important thing animal presence something eat 
only later become adapt internal communication 
big surprise 
it genome say trichoplax animal full blow nervous system include synaptic protein neurotransmitter system muscle protein even engage behavior expect would require neuromuscular system 
but instead ﬁnd foreign unrecognizable cellular anatomy axon synapses muscle 
there three possibility trichoplax nervous system lose anatomical specialization process acquire simpler lifestyle 
alternatively expectation wrong nervous system look much different expect 
finally may never one really look animal piece
