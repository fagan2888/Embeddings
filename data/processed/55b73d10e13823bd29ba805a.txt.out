general situation 
the value total annual mineral production alaska increase though increase due almost entirely large copper output mine prosperity mining industry whole evident 
the rather widespread pessimism regard present future prosperity alaska mining industry hard understand 
dazzle quick fortune make prosperous day bonanza placer mine public fail mark steady advance permanent phase mine continued war greatly accelerate last two year 
the great publicity give failure large auriferous quartz mine near juneau reason later discuss entirely obscure slow steady development alaska lode property 
the marked decline annual copper output since result low price metal erroneously interpret mark decline alaska copper mining industry 
the public mislead widely circulate grossly exaggerated statement value alaska coal land puzzle apparent lack progress exploitation 
thus far indeed discourage result meet rather meager underground exploration best alaska coal

alaska mine produce nearly half billion dollar worth mineral per cent amount come deposit gold silver copper 
the estimate known reserve metal alone without regard future discovery mineral oil coal sufficient assure prosperous future mining industry 
many appear believe building alaska railroad immediately produce marked boom 
now year pass since railroad begin furnish transportation cheap fuel immediate increase mineral output loud condemning entire project
