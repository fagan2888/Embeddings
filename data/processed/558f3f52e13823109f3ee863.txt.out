use precipitation temperature value obtain collbran rifle possible calculate sediment yield runoff value data summarize schumm fig 
low elevation sediment yield maximum basis current average precipitation value approximately inch mean annual temperature schumm fig 
high elevation although rainfall temperature record available precipitation may average much inch mean annual temperature postulate 
use figure sediment yield relatively low high elevation although runoff would high 
consequently stream aggradation might expect low elevation degradation high ele vations 
aggradation observe low elevatiors along small local ephemeral stream 
but along tlie major perennial stream degradation seem prevalent probably high runoff come high elevation aid flush high sediment yield derive low elevation beyond area consequently downcutting along stream occurs even low elevation 
use curve determine schumm relate mean annual precipitation temperature sediment yield interesting postulate effect climatic change might sediment yield runoff 
low elevation almost typ climatic change either warm colder wetter drier combination would result decreased sediment yield 
high elevation peculate value precipitation temperature valid climate get warm drier would change sediment yield 
such change would probably increase sediment yield 
this increase sediment yield high elevation would offset much great decrease sediment yield low elevation assume climatic change affect low area downcutting would probably prevail rapid rate present 
summary late tertiary and quaternary history 
cooler wetter condition would probably produce net decrease sediment yield owe expected increase amount vegetation hold soil particularly low intermediate elevation 
runoff would increase great precipitation lessen evaporation result downcutting would also proceed rapid rate present 
the increase sediment yield contribute streams mass waste wetter cooler time could alter regimen appreciably 
stream aggradation might occur low elevation amount surficial debris contribute mass waste becomes unusually large
