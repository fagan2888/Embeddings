gold vein decrease value expect oxidized zone reason expect similar change lead vein 
fact probable ore enrich silver derive weather upper part vein best deposit may expect water level zone yet deeply explored 
the scarcity zinc lead vein noteworthy 
it absence may extent due leach sulphate water derive oxidation pyrite chalcopyrite upper part lode 
helena mine however ore level probable limit leach low zinc scarcity metal thus indicate primary feature 
the occurrence galena little zinc sulphide generally characterize zone somewhat remote magmatic source
