abstract report villager live area northern part lakhi range suggest coal mine mountain northwest lakhra anticline sometime within past year 
the region question lie northwest pakistan large coal field 
since stratum mine coal lakhra anticline expose northern lakhi range mountains well ridge west may regard potential coal prospect 
this reconnaissance study initiate evaluate coal resource potential coal bearing bara formation area fort ranikot lakhi range 
coal find bara rock fort ranikot 
however five root carbonaceous shale may residuum weathered high ash coal find 
the two thick carbonaceous shale bed five root interval also identify 
area lakhra anticline root interval almost always associate coal bed carbonaceous shale though correlation may hold fort ranikot 
six covered interval observe 
because cover interval typically occur shaly zone possibility additional root interval carbonaceous shale coal bed may obscure 
structural complication may also major factor obscure potential coal bed 
the section measure across flank compress part anticline 
similar structural setting elsewhere world compression force may mobilize coal squeeze flank 
comprehensive assessment coal potential bara formation fort ranikot require investigation much less deformed stratum western part lakhi range

this observation contradiction result ahmed siddiqui unpublished data report approximately lakhra stratum top approximately section 
their criterion distinguish lakhra bara formation unclear

conclusion and recommendation because field time limited investigation reconnaissance survey 
the primary objective study measure describe complete section bara formation possible exist description type section principal reference section lack detail measurement contradictory 
hop return area later date consider structural complexity 
however return prove impossible due security requirement stem arm attack one field party 
consequently number unresolved structural question persist 
accurately determine whether sohnari lakhra bara formation thin thicken fault erode lakhi range significant implication future coal exploration fort ranikot area 
accord data publish hunt survey map hunt survey bara formation underlies least lakhi range 
this area comparable size area currently produce coal lakhra anticline 
coal present bara formation lakhi range may accessible mine directly bara formation expose western flank lakhi anticline possibly ridge west lakhi range 
sohnari lakhra formation thin absent bara formation coal bed may also accessible shaft area overlie laki formation cheema other report thick area thin erosion 
the measurement section fort ranikot area must consider preliminary 
there enough question geology bara formation stratum around fort justify additional work 
more work must do resolve disparity report thickness bara formation confirm apparent absence lakhra formation sohnari formation region 
excellent exposure bara formation find many place throughout lakhi range 
order obtain complete understanding coal potential fort ranikot area facies characteristics variability bara formation series section measure length lakhi range 
the numerous carbonaceous shale root interval suggest area coal potential surficial geologic survey far evaluate potential 
however surficial structural process tend obscure coal bed one two well place drill hole need definitively evaluate coal prospect area 
accord hunt survey map ranikot probably bara formation rock also expose bera daphro east ridge directly west fort ranikot small outlier daphro west ridge 
these area accessible wheel drive vehicle include follow study 
the hunting survey map indicate laki formation outlier west daphro west ridge 
though outlier appear severely fault fold probably would difficult mine coal resource eventually proven occur lakhi range rock far western laki outcrop may also become prospective coal
