foraminifera from the crescent formation two distinctly different type foraminifer fauna find crescent formation 
one consist almost entirely planktonic foraminifera know lenticular body reddish argillaceous limestone interbedded volcanic rock 
the type fauna consist chiefly benthonic foraminifera know occur basaltic sandstone tuffaceous siltstone upper part crescent formation 
planktonic assemblage foraminifera first report lenticular body reddish argillaceous limestone crescent formation pardee later mention park 
about thin section reddish argillaceous limestone locality examine connection present study 
five locality f11711 f11715 
within map area 
because fossil could separate matrix examine thin section specifically identify 
most foraminifera planktonic either globigerinids globorotalids none globotruncanids 
the foraminifera abundant locally commonly concentrated thin layer 
such concentration planktonic foraminifera find calcareous rock crescent formation rarely find tertiary rock pacific northwest 
the abundance planktonic foraminifer remain lack benthonic foraminifer remain red argillaceous limestone bed could indirectly attribute contemporaneous volcanic activity 
the small lenticular body red limestone probably represent period volcanism locally inactive 
nevertheless volcanism probably continue nearby area volcanic debris incorporate red limestone 
unlikely type foraminifera live near area undergo submarine volcanism 
planktonic foraminifera bring environment ocean current probably would die mass test would deposit concentration part accumulate sediment 
benthonic nonfloating form less likely transport large number ocean current therefore general planktonic foraminifer test would deposit 
the planktonic assemblage crescent formation probably post cretaceous age consist globigerinids globorotalids without globotruncanids indicative cretaceous age
