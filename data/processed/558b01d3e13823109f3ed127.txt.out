geophysical data suggest continuous basement extend westward beneath central valley beyond hayward fault

study area contemporary seismogenic deformation appear concentrated basement fault mechanism primarily strike slip upper crustal structure clearly compression 
interpret fault surface independent separated basement deformation tectonic wedge decollement structure 
significance deep seismic study area interpret two way 
first continuation general trend eastward deepen base seismogenic zone cause lower geothermal gradient jones 
eastward deepen occurs response increasingly mafic middle crust strong temperature sibson cause brittle ductile transition zone depress encounter increase mafic content 
either case middle crust deforms strike slip fashion upper crust deforms compression 
how vertical partitioning accomplish 
find tectonic model involve broad decollement beneath coast range jones offer best mechanism allow transmission shear stress basement rock depth cause earthquake leave upper crustal block independent 
compression pittsburg kirby hill fault midland fault occur within upper crust generate several way westward movement sierran block coast range wright wong ely hill component motion normal san andreas fault system wong harbert cox page brocher jones local change stress field generate bound geometry move crustal block hill wang
