while earthquake size historically occur mount geologic geomorphologic geophysical evidence suggest occurrence strong possibility 
large crustal intraplate earthquake magnitude historically occur pacific northwest expect continue occur 
furthermore level instrument record seismic although uniform across region one high united state 
potential loss pacific northwest result either great subduction zone earthquake crustal intraplate earthquake near population center expect large number reason 
first population grow considerably last decade continue increase rapidly 
second building bridge lifeline transportation facility design build withstand large earthquake 
third population center hence area contain high concentration building pacific northwest tend locate basin low lie coastal area area poorly consolidate sedimentary rock likely amplify ground motion susceptible local ground failure 
great subduction zone earthquake area could cost billion result loss hundred life 
crustal intraplate earthquake magnitude near seattle could cause loss range ten million dollar
