hydrographs fig 
show water level generally high spring 
time snowmelt rain normally recharge ground water reservoir 
however ice cover frost ground impede infiltration 
under condition water snowmelt flow overland little recharge occurs 
generally less recharge occur summer rainfall evaporate transpired flow overland intense thunderstorm 
fall evapotranspiration reduce heavy rain may cause water level rise 
frozen ground impedes infiltration water winter 
although quantity precipitation major factor affect ground water level many natural factor soil condition nature underlie rock slope land surface affect level 
minor fluctuation level cause earth tide variation barometric pressure 
evapotranspiration cause small daily decline water level shallow well
