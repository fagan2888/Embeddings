summary series spectacular discovery transform understanding mesozoic mammal recent year 
these ﬁnds reveal hitherto unsuspected ecomorphological diversity suggest mammal experience major adaptive radiation middle late jurassic 
pattern mammalian macroevolution must reinterpret light new discovery taxonomic diversity limited aspect morphological disparity quantiﬁed 
ass rate morphological evolution temporal pattern disparity use large datasets discrete character

this intense burst phenotypic innovation coincide stepwise increase apparent long term stand diversity attainment maximum disparity support short fuse model early mammalian diversiﬁcation 
rate decline sharply remain signiﬁcantly low end mesozoic even among therians 
this support long fuse model diversiﬁcation mesozoic therians 
our ﬁndings demonstrate sustain morphological innovation triassic stem group mammal culminate global adaptive radiation crown group member early middle jurassic 
result quantify rate morphological evolution crucial interpreting macroevolutionary event deep time especially assess potential adaptive radiation 
contrary traditional view mesozoic mammal exclusively small generalized insectivore discovery last two decade especially china demonstrate adapted diverse feed locomotor ecology 
these ﬁnds extend early mammal repertoire include dig climb glide swim show non therian lineage achieve surprisingly large body size approximately 
much morphological diversity appear rapidly middle jurassic wave diversiﬁcation ,’’ ﬁrst recognize luo interpreted major adaptive radiation meng 
the hypothesis adaptive radiation make several quantitatively testable prediction include occurrence high early rate lineage diversiﬁcation phenotypic evolution lead substantial increase taxonomic diversity morphological disparity 
rigorous statistical analysis demonstrate substantial increase mammal diversity middle jurassic 
however occur rate phenotypic evolution relation observe pattern disparity explore use quantitative analysis 
rate morphological evolution few study quantify pattern morphological evolution mesozoic mammal none rigorously analyze rate morphological evolution across two specie 
across mesozoic mammal whole pattern disparity feed ecomorphology quantiﬁed via geometric morphometric analysis mandibular outline morphology couple linear measurement qualitative categorization tooth morphology linear measurement use characterize locomotor ecology

large datasets discrete character contrast potentially provide comprehensive overview morphological transformation occur major evolutionary transition document anatomical change occur throughout skeleton include many comparison amenable continuous measurement 
several recent study evaluate rate morphological evolution opt rich datasets discrete character originally construct phylogenetic inference 
this emerge technique yield stimulating result could signiﬁcantly advance understanding macroevolution 
however little consideration thus far give potential limitation approach 
two key bias may affect estimate rate disparity base morphological datasets construct phylogenetics unrepresentative inclusion taxon unrepresentative formulation inclusion character

the early cretaceous peak associate high rate indicate although middle jurassic mammal proportionally sample phylogenetic dataset unlikely inﬂated estimate evolutionary rate 
multituberculates underwent substantial late cretaceous radiation measure dental complexity insufﬁciently sample focal matrix
