conclusion recommendations the clear drop resistivity measurement seawater ﬂooding signiﬁcant increase supercritical co2 
ﬂooding high maximum oil saturation suggest electrical resistivity tomography ert electromagnetic base log reliably use monitor performance co2 injection storage saline carbonate rock formation 
easy discriminate co2 plume interstitial saline water reservoir 
however ert base log may beneﬁcial monitoring co2 eor performance carbonate rock give low resistivity contrast oil saturate co2 saturate core 
the low resistivity contrast make diﬃcult distinguish oil co2 plume movement reservoir 
thus quantify amount oil mobilize co2 injection use exist ert base log alone may plague high uncertainty 
nevertheless mitigate combine ert log pulse neutron spectroscopy log distinguish oil co2
