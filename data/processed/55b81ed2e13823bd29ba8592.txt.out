conclusion the economic potential underclay bed allegheny group somerset eastern fayette county seem favorable mercer clay bed central pennsylvania olive hill clay bed northeastern kentucky 
both mercer clay olive hill clay occur pottsville group early pennsylvanian age compose fairly continuous bed quartz free flint semiflint clay pennsylvania geological survey hosterman 
the underclay bed allegheny group however contain considerable quartz silt flint semiflint clay occur discontinuous lens pod intercalate much plastic clay 
additional economic factor commonwealth pennsylvania plan restrict mining vicinity laurel hill area schedule development recreational area 
there however reserve silty flint semiflint clay available throughout somerset eastern fayette county sufficient supply decline market high grade refractory clay product
