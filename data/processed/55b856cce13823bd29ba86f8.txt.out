foreword this series report soil chronosequences western united state attempt integrate study different earth science discipline include pedology geomorphology stratigraphy quaternary geology general 
each discipline provide information important other 
from geomorphic relation determine relative age deposit soil stratigraphy place age constraint soil 
field investigation mineralogic sedimentologic study provide information nature type deposit soil form 
result work estimate rate soil formation inferred process soil formation trend soil development increase age obtain information type weather occur various area 
return soil development soil genesis provide data age landforms time duration sedimentation case history climatic fluctuation 
between coordinate systematic study conduct soil development different type geologic deposit western united state 
the goal project lead late 
marchand subsequently 
machette learn whether rate chemical physical mineralogic transformation could determine soil chronosequences rate vary different mineralogic climatic environment accurately soil use problem estimate age deposit period landscape stability timing fault movement

report series basic field information geologic background analytical data present chronosequence well result additional previous publication 
one significant aspects chronosequence study every study area many soil parameter change systematically time age deposit 
deming emphasize recurrence correlation different condition significant geologic pedologic study 
relatively moist area coastal central california soil property percent clay redden soil color change systematically time 
arid region bighorn basin wyoming calcium carbonate gypsum content best reflect relative age deposit 
parameter example elemental composition sand clays appear comparable area diverse climatic setting 
numeric age control enable estimate rate soil development 
place able compare rate different area 
for example central california rate clay accumulation find rapid initial stage soil development rate decline increase age 
the straight line regression loglog scale 
coastal california rate clay accumulation appear much high central california 
this difference rate could due parent material coastal soil study form reworked shale sandstone whereas central california soil develop granitic alluvium difference rate could due eolian addition clay 
bighorn basin wyoming rate clay accumulation well soil property increase linearly time apparent decrease initial rate 
the data present suggest many opportunity interpretation 
for example may learn climate vegetation mineralogy affect rate clay formation organic matter accumulation 
study area present data rare earth element could use examine element reacts different weather environment 
these example fraction possible future study could conduct data present
