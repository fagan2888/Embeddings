world petroleum resource perspective charles master abstract world oil gas resource appear quantity ensure significant availability middle twenty first century 
the geologically expectable narrow distribution resource however suggest always form barrier limit freedom use 
these barrier take dimension national security issue realize twice much oil could block strait hormuz available around world surplus daily production capacity 
even continue frontier exploration effort success distribution reality likely change suggest importance consider develop alternate energy source coal uranium 
term btu coal capacity displace oil gas still provide significant energy society hundred year uranium give breeder reactor millenia 
both however also suffer natural resource dilemma irregular distribution therefore always subject continue shortage matter successful geologic exploration 
need concept interdependence mechanism penetrate social political economic barrier resource availability 
introduction three year ago geological survey world energy resource program group invite convener panel discussion world reserve crude oil llth world petroleum congress present paper distribution quantitative assessment world petroleum reserve resource master other 
develop world understand oil ally petroleum engineering capability energy information administration examine reserve concentrate undiscovered resource 
since program presentation london publish various geologic analysis assessment conclusion continue process ongoing modification various assessment hypothesis 
even though assessment world petroleum move target believe sufficient understanding subject clearly see long term reality interdependent world begin draw relationship possible energy source 
intend paper present geologic understand certain critical part world certain data trend believe important resource analysis finally suggest option respect energy resource along order magnitude time might expect enjoy significant use particular resource commodity 
world crude oil resource order gain perspective world petroleum resource number important appreciate rate change system relative discovery production 
figure show change annual amount discovery year increment past year compare annual amount production 
clearly discovery downtrend high billion barrel oil per year present day billion barrel new oil discover per year 
production billion barrel oil per year outpace discovery factor almost two world recession surely would even great disparity discovery production 
bear mind annual dimension oil discovery use figure show world already discover large amount petroleum resource 
the bar graph bottom figure show reserve cumulative production january probability curve top figure show undiscovered resource january 
know annual discovery production rate number bring date readily 
the billion barrel reserve time annual production billion barrel likely value undiscovered resource billion barrel one half much already discover 
give discover billion barrel new oil year project potential substantial oil discovery production middle twenty first century 
respect seem long time certainly far future real confidence forecasting 
but point capacity see rationale limit prudent recognize evidence conclusion monitor clue might direct toward satisfactory adjustment whatever future energy reality 
not conventional oil large supply potential achieve additional reserve enhance recovery light oil well extra heavy oil tar sand certainly positive 
would argue however additional oil likely come ground relatively slowly relatively expensively bailey fiorillo therefore meet high production rate require major contribution fuel energy mix rather serve resource petrochemical long time 
that hypothesis dimension oil potentially available enhanced recovery well extra heavy oil tar sand resource large energy analyst must always stay abreast change technology reality subject area change technology could shift establish distribution world petroleum energy resource 
give today conventional oil proper focus attention address energy issue need consider limitation primarily relate distribution alternative least near term primarily gas coal
