evernden hibbard schneider point intensity prediction base model suppose double peak acceleration unit increase intensity ignore high frequency value short epicentral distance correlate good intensity intensity 
addition medvedev show intensity value define twofold step peak response pendulum instrument design accentuate period near range period relevance normal intensity observation achieve excellent agreement intensity well numerous intensity scale clearly disagree value

continual introduction restrictive building code wood frame structure california require redefinition intensity zone

the explanation high value earthquakes certainly simple regional difference attenuation

interesting note university california berkeley often report value great california institute technology pasadena southern california earthquake mcevilly oral commun 
possible explanation differ value data use establish richter curve may contaminate multiprovince path 
use formulae evernden normalizing set equation earthquake high frequency energy thus fault length give follow

seismic intensity earthquakes conterminous united state 
crustal calibration function region elaborate theme last paragraph one major continue error estimate seismological parameter use invalid calibration formula

the value report station distance range earthquake ignore 
secondly mean value report station range mean value report station range

therefore compare magnitude use report author value event would occur western california record low amplitude station 
next consider report value

both value compare report value dyne would predict earthquake region 1v2 
all value probably indistinguishable calculated basis shortperiod seismogram

length break versus moment versus value 
length break versus moment versus value throughout the united state and suggest interpretation point probably require reemphasis meaningful physical sense value calculate intensity data 
the procedure calculate value must reiterate

then determine value require region region calibration versus energy supply calculate energy requirement 
evaluate whether calculated value region meaningful compare data establish actual length break earthquake estimate

however typical east african type intraplate rift present subsurface cannot believe seismic along single long fault 
rift fault accord map literature examine

perhaps seismic confine one side rift long fault zone could postulate even bound fault rift commonly echelon 
our estimate 2vfe value earthquake evernden may may consistent field observation 
because know correct value anything permissible basis available data cannot deny possibility fault much long 
there positive evidence technique estimate value yield accurate result several region reason technique fail region available data new madrid area indicate indeed fail yield accurate estimate 
the conclusion one must draw result fault zones region united state similar 
asperity must essentially equal strength equal mean distribution fault surface region 
whatever effective stress condition one region duplicate other 
the inhomogeneity stress fault surface region san andreas fault express asperity stress drops several hundred bar average stress drop ten bar common knowledge 
what new pattern probably similar region unite

the mean stress rise somewhat without affect high frequency energy cannot rise order magnitude

apparent nearly desire ratio possible concept 
the asperity fault surface provide nearly high frequency energy inhomogeneous relaxation much low average stress level provide long period energy 
the question arise why one hypothesize total volume relaxation what reasonable value give satisfactory answer 
the basis total volume relaxation hypothesis found 
the conclusion base intensity data fault zone similar thus strongly condition weaken 
the suggestion observation dilatancy may occur eastern united state dilatancy imply extensive fracture weakening volume surround fault 
the fact high value measure ambient stress many eastern united state rock along fact pervasive fracturing rock epicentral region new madrid earthquake frank mckeown oral commun

thus give fjiq ratio limit volume total relaxation require partial relaxation large volume need 
the required dimension seem deny available data 
point address qualitatively corner frequency effect note investigator eastern united state earthquakes implication effect regard value within conventional model 
suggest rapid fault breakage follow slow rate relaxation appreciable volume soft inclusion lead spectral shape uninterpretable homogeneous model 
some interesting relation suggest 
major implication one seek sit potentially damaging eastern united state earthquakes seek zone low ambient stress 
high stress implies high rigidity little chance fault failure 
low ambient stress extensive fracturing possibly associate evidence fluid movement depth typify seismic zone eastern united state 
another interesting possibility high deformation associate relaxation finite volume radius several kilometer would provide environment detectable small strain could see many kilometer epicenter 
inclusion deform premonitorily earthquake small concomitantly detectable deformation strong region surround weak inclusion 
thus may mechanism effect measureable strain distance inconceivable model base upon homogeneous elastic model
