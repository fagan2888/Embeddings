introduction the long term 
average rate right lateral motion pacific north american plate california minster jordan 
central california north transverse range motion currently take place san andreas fault 
northwest parkfield accomodated aseismic slip rigid block motion thatcher southeast parkfield occasional great earthquake sieh 
the remain yet unaccounted 
plate motion rate constant time long term average rate match short term rate balance presumably take somewhere offshore coastal fault rocky mountain either slip fault distribute shear 
several recent study suggest possiblity offshore coastal fault hosgri san gregario system form single go fault system 
conception western terminus transverse range intersection san gregario san andreas north golden gate bolinas lagoon silver normark 
some interpret geologic data indicate large offset system since upper miocene time graham dickinson 
work late quaternary deformation marine terrace san gregorio fault run offshore ano nuevo san mateo county favor current slip rate weber cotton 
addition recent modeling work global plate motion interpret favor offshore system jordan 
this interpretation likely permit geologic data fact significant net right lateral displacement yet prove basin range province likely candidate discrepency plate motion slip san andreas 
because offshore fault underwater length difficult determine fault currently active form go fault system capable absorb significant plate motion generate large earthquake 
principle seismology might contribute resolve question use epicentral location small moderate earthquake demonstrate activity specific fault outline continuity exist among individual fault segment system 
practice however approach make difficult fact much region lie offshore fall gap seismic network center los angel san francisco metropolitan area result poor areal distribution seismograph station precise epicentral location possible 
station coverage particularly sparse point conception monterey great uncertainty exist concern activity continuity candidate fault 
gawthrop relocate instrument record earthquake epicenter region show clearly region seismic active diffuse pattern epicentral location make difficult establish activity one individual fault determine fault might connect even whether diffuse pattern real artifact 
uncertainty earthquake location 
the recent expansion region short period seismic network operate usgs california figure part national earthquake hazard reduction program permit first time precise location microearthquakes magnitude 
while station operation short time data already collect along one section coastal fault system shed light fault activity 
epicentral location complete analysis period aug oct earthquake san andreas fault hosgri fault system morro bay lat north san simeon lat area enclose dark line figure 
during time earthquake locate west san andreas within region six occur small cluster near san ardo oil field discuss 
the remain occur far west within belt coastal fault 
figure one third record activity event occur along west sur nacimiento fault zone 
the role fault current tectonic regime california unclear although discordant material juxtapose across suggests major strike slip displacement occur along since mesozoic time 
the event locate date along sur nacimiento small well resolve individual focal mechanism possible 
however composite mechanism four best record event consistent right lateral motion strike along trend fault figure aside two small event locate kilometer far west toward coast remain activity locate offshore along hosgri fault zone 
most activity cluster point piedras blancas northern edge study area figure 
this cluster earthquakes include event sept follow sequence small aftershock next day 
the distribution earthquake point piedras blancas extend coast line western map fault appear due scatter epicentral location 
one indication tight cluster location obtain aftershock event rabbit shaped figure around figure 
also compute confidence ellipsoid event figure major ax surface projection show 
case minor axis parallel coast less length major axis 
where error bar show entire confidence ellipse fit inside plotted circle 
conclude activity occur area many sub parallel map fault trace 
the event large enough allow attempt focal mechanism figure 
while one side coverage precludes unique solution large thrust component imply 
assume fault plane strike n40w parallel local trend map fault one possible fault plane drawn dip north east beneath continent 
pure right lateral strike slip solution along strike preclude component normal slip 
one event locate far south along hosgri fault zone month period study magnitude event west morro bay august label figure 
the epicentral location event formally quite well constrain confidence ellipse small size dot plot 
whether epicenter lie precisely trace hosgri fault depend whether systematic bias exist location procedure 
this possibility must seriously consider course near station 20km away 
azimuthal coverage less figure 
believe solution obtain figure reliable follow reason extreme care take calibrate velocity model use find evidence lateral velocity change sufficient significantly bias solution 
four arrival use solution 
while none pick unequivocal none arrival time fit perfectly overall consistency convincing 
the large residual sec correspond epicentral uncertain 
focal mechanism also attempt event figure 
little say except either strike slip normal solution parallel hosgri fault permit thrust solution 
included figure location magnitude event point sal may year 
although outside scope report include seem quite probable also locate hosgri fault within kilometer epicenter gawthrop 1978a magnitude seven lompoc earthquake 
actually two location event show figure list table 
the first gawthrop unpublished data second cockerham unpublished data 
the two solution totally independent base different approach model crustal structure 
gawthrop use linear gradient half space velocity model cockerham jet 
conventional plane layer structure 
believe therefore difference two location good estimate true uncertain argue strongly earthquake near hosgri fault 
both group obtain pure thrust focal mechanism event similar obtain sept event point piedras blancas figure 
conclusion clearly broad question pose introduction cannot answer small amount data present 
preliminary answer limit question permit however 
the hosgri fault zone seismic active sense small moderate earthquake epicenter clearly locate near surface trace 
two event hosgri fault reasonably well constrain thrust focal mechansims 
each possible fault plane parallel local strike hosgri fault zone dip northeast beneath continent angle 
however thrust solution preclude third event hosgri fault right lateral strike slip solution permit 
number small epicenter locate along sur nacimiento fault zone 
composite focal mechanism suggest right lateral strike slip displacement parallel fault 
aside persistent cluster activity near san ardo oil field epicenter locate sur nacimiento san andreas fault 
small epicenter locate hosgri sur nacimiento system overall impression activity center two coastal fault system 
use three month seismic report estimate average activity level figure 
the data fit well slope value log 
this predict event per year within region study 
assume half activity occur offshore detailed experiment use portable ocean bottom seismograph would run two month reasonable expectation record dozen earthquake along hosgri system
