fecal coliform bacteria 
bacteria present intestine feces warm blood animal 
they often use indicator sanitary quality water 
laboratory define organisms produce blue colony within hour incubated medium nutrient medium bacterial growth 
concentration express number colony per sample 
fecal streptococcal bacteria 
bacteria also present intestine warm blood animal 
their presence water consider verify fecal contamination 
they characterize gram positive cocci bacteria capable growth brain heart infusion broth 
laboratory define organism produce red pink colony within hour streptococcus medium nutrient medium bacterial growth 
their concentration express number colony per sample

location description study area 
method investigation 
the study area include low sioux indian community locate partially southern high bluff partially within wide valley underfit minnesota river fig 
the escarpment separate two area steep vertical elevation change 
the minnesota river underfit form large flow drain glacial lake agassiz payne 
the area surround minnesota river valley mainly use agricultural production 
within study area topography change slightly roll hill glacial drift plain upland relatively flat topography river valley 
much glacial drift overlies precambrian cretaceous bedrock upland 
the bedrock expose along escarpment form southern edge minnesota river valley 
within valley alluvial deposit typically range thickness overlie precambrian bedrock 
the hummocky surface glacial drift upland result numerous shallow lake wetland 
addition abandon quarry fill water become wetland area 
along escarpment groundwater discharge glacial bedrock aquifer provide flow numerous spring drain minnesota river 
valley abandon river meander produce oxbow lake wetland area 
during last year large flow minnesota river flood many lake wetlands many month year 
water level larson lake measure use four staff gage instal southern portion lake table 
four gage need lake exceed bank flood minnesota river extend south normal lake condition 
multiple gage allow accurate stage measurement flood condition 
each gage survey relation local benchmark lake stage interpret relative altitude

vertical profile measure center lake march 
all temperature dissolve oxygen measurement make near shore approximately water surface 
water depth larson lake measured september use weighted rope table
