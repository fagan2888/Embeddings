ontogenetic variation document within many dinosaur specie extreme ontogenetic change rare among dinosaur particularly among theropod 
here analyze specimen jurassic ceratosaurian theropod limusaurus inextricabilis represent six ontogenetic stage base body size histological data 
among ontogenetic change identify specimen unexpected one change fully toothed jaw hatchling juvenile individual completely toothless beak jaw mature individual represent ﬁrst fossil record ontogenetic edentulism among jawed vertebrate 
jaw morphological data include derived mct scan limusaurus specimen reveal dental alveolar vestige indicate ontogenetic tooth loss limusaurus gradual complex process 
our discovery signiﬁcant implication understand evolution beak important feeding structure present several tetrapod clade include modern bird 
this radical morphological change suggest dietary shift probably omnivory juvenile limusaurus herbivory adult limusaurus also support additional evidence gastroliths stable isotope 
incorporate new ontogenetic information limusaurus phylogenetic analysis demonstrate surprisingly little effect placement data different stage use exclusively contrast previous analysis tyrannosaurids produce subtle difference extend beyond placement limusaurus

the discovery ontogenetic edentulism theropod limusaurus potentially signiﬁcant understanding development evolution beak important feeding structure present several tetrapod clade include modern bird 
early signal pathway involve odontogenesis remain inducible modern bird fully develop dentition present early postnatal ontogenetic stage limusaurus indicate complete signal pathway responsible odontogensis present viable least one fully beak theropod 
this suggest dental developmental regression might occur heterochronically evolution beak animal lineage include beak theropod taxa future investigation ontogenetic change jaw morphology include dental morphology genetic development beak need test hypothesis

large body size adult limusaurus suggest insectivory unlikely 
the fact small individual stage iii display wider range isotope value large individual stage suggest juvenile limusaurus occupy varied dietary niche mature individual probably omnivore 
theoretical ground omnivory ensures great survival rate immature individual ontogenetic dietary niche shift reduce competition food juvenile adult individual within population 
theropod specie often establish base juvenile specimen taxonomic evaluation specimen problematic 
the result present phylogenetic analysis suggest cladistic approach taxonomic assignment juvenile specimen warrant though local
