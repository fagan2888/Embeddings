quality water the alluvial aquifer american bottom east louis illinois david voelker abstract ground water level american bottom region around east louis illinois rise several foot since early 
artificial dewatering aquifer increase pump investigated army corp engineer alleviate economic health concern result elevate ground water level

introduction the american bottom one favorable ground water area illinois fig 
provide large quantity water year schicht 
prior development east louis area water table near land surface many shallow lake pond swamp poorly drain area 
the abundance ground water proximity railroad mississippi river prompt development region 
major industry include steel manufacturing oil refine chemical manufacturing meat pack establish bottom prior 
development area provide good drainage lower ground water level estimate foot bruin smith 
period lower ground water level much present infrastructure residential housing commercial development build 
wehrmann report estimate pumpage well increase mgal million gallon per day mgal 
extend dry period decrease ground water reserve force several industry abandon well cut back production 
after many industry convert surface water source wehrmann 
ground water pumpage decline sharply mgal gradually increased mgal schicht jones emmons 
pumpage decrease mgal industry practice ground water conservation other shut completely 
since ground water use continue decline emmons result increased water level elevation 
water level fluctuation reflect change water use discuss detail schicht reitz baker emmons wehrmann 
second factor rise ground water level rise level mississippi river 
schicht jones conclude ground water level especially near river affect change river stage 
increase precipitation along rise mississippi river stage due construction chain rock canal abnormally high river stage contribute significant prolonged rise grind water level throughout american bottom schicht 
the high water level result reduction pumpage increase mississippi river stage cause several problem throughout american bottom 
the army corp engineer louis district outline problem area later army corps engineer write commun indicate area additional problem anticipate fig 
there sewer failure resultant potential ground water contamination health hazard flood basement structural damage foundation home business necessity construct extensive dewatering system along major highway system 
aside economic importance high water level also public health concern due infiltration sewer line break well landfill area 
landfill locate within american bottom use disposal industrial waste 
the potential ground water contamination landfills high aquifer material compose mostly sand gravel easily infiltrate surface contaminant 
the army corp engineer evaluate mean reduce damage cause high ground water level american bottom 
one alternative consider low water level increase pumpage army

this alternative require evaluation suitability discharge ground water irrigation industrial water supply public water supply discharge stream 
purpose scope this report provide ground water quality data american bottom evaluate condition may affect use evaluate dewatering scheme include determination ground water quality comparison ground water quality illinois water quality standard criterion illinois pollution control board identification area anomalously high chemical constituent concentration determination suitability discharge ground water irrigation industrial water supply public water supply
