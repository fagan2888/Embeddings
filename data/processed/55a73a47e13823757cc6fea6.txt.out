conclusion data surface subsurface sample indicate sediment produce situ 
the absence grain wear sediment transport indicator ripple scour mark indicate little movement sand size sediment 
however water current probably transport silt clay size sediment may largely responsible variance water clarity 
the type amount biological production area area seem somewhat influenced water movement may supply nutrient may suspend fine sediment therefore reduce sunlight penetration 
additional support situ production come observation live constituent study area 
these observation show percentages live sediment produce organisms similar percentage dead organisms sediment area 
study chave 
indicate sediment production well within capability fauna flora find study area 
environment control type amount biogenic sediment produce 
the change sediment zonations study inferred result environmental control biogenic production 
comparison zonations bathymetry fig 
area indicate strong correlation water depth biota 
water temperature amount sunlight consider author important environmental factor affect biogenic carbonate production 
water temperature measurement towle take thomas southern platform average vary le throughout year 
such narrow range probably exclude temperature major influence carbonate production 
sunlight therefore seem dominant influence penetration directly related water depth 
because direct relationship exist sunlight photosynthesis marine plant fauna contain symbiotic algae would sensitive sunlight change 
the marine animal without symbiotic relationship although indirectly dependent upon sunlight would affect less change 
this dependence sunlight account decrease chlorophyta rhodophyta group available sunlight decrease increase water depth 
thus offshore chlorophyta group give way mollusc group great water depth begin limit photosynthesis 
exception show figure deeper water specie complex halimeda tuna find large number 
however general nearshore shallow water would productive except shallow area wind generated current flow create turbidity thus lower sunlight penetration 
•.· fig 
bathymetry southern shelf thomas holmes 
the area study southwestern road region productive carbonate sediment shallowness low turbidity allow sunlight penetration hence specie production 
shallow water nearshore tend turbidity great susceptibility wind driven current direct observation scuba 
the southwestern road area also partially protect strong current offshore island water probably less turbid open shelf water 
the productivity area probably account thickness sand deposit 
the similarity surficial subsurface sediment indicate sediment production continuous process time span represent core 
the appearance barnacle fragment approximately level fig 
core decrease rhodophyta sea floor level may indicate subsidence region cause increase water depth shelf 
tectonic subsidence suggest geophysical record area holmes 
subsidence create increase water depth would cause change environment southwestern road area fig 
protect lagoon openshelf condition today 
tidal current would able sweep area much great effect 
habitat food supply might change 
this change environment relatively shallow protect area open marine environment could account disappearance balanus venustus area approximately year ago newman oral communication 
the increase water depth probably provide habitat suitable rhodophyta seem prefer deep calm water area protect full force tidal current 
this increase water depth would account increase rhodophyta ppermost sediment lee side offshore island 
although water depth appear increase past thousand year change seem little effect sediment producer rate sediment production 
indication sediment budget southern shelf remain fairly stable past year control situ biogenic production carbonate sediment
