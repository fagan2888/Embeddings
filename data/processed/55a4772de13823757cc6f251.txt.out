single bone find apparently deposit sedimentary clast within sediment unit 
group bone burrow ground surface bury paleosol b2b3 find 
the fossil examine repenning find two type rodent represent burrow spermophilus townsendi townsend ground squirrel peromyscus 
truei pinon mouse 
pertinent quotation repenning write communication follow 
the pinon mouse somewhat north recorded range difference seem significant represent collection single first low molar 
the presence pinon mouse ground squirrel burrow difficult understand townsend ground squirrel observe carry dead rodent place safety eat 
11the townsend ground squirrel resident area represent collection large number bone represent least three individual two large old 
the squirrel build two type burrow home burrow nest auxiliary burrow without nest near feed place 
the auxiliary burrow use 
protective shelter may may well drain 
home burrow report deep auxiliary burrow small shallow average less depth 
the age group collection position downthrown side fault fine grain material find suggest auxiliary burrow seem evidence nest kaplan henry pers 
the suggestion thus would burrow auxiliary relate buried soil horizon rather present land surface 
upon ignition bone clearly smell burnt hair indicate considerable organic matter remain unleached within bone 
experience show organic matter leach bone normal circumstance within year

the sample contain clast bone sediment unit contain fragment rodent radius indistinguishable spermophilus townsendi unidentifiable 
also smell burnt hair ignite caliche coat 
caliche note bone burrow

additional discussion uncertainty interpretation data warrant importance date history displacement along fault 
two critical question certain age bone material relation bone soil stratigraphic unit 
date rodent bone material repenning pers 
communcation report strength burn hair smell suggest large proportion unleached organic material thus date young year might appropriate year 
modern age bone cannot rule criterion presence caliche coat bone fragment clast suggest age old modern 
relation rodent bone paleosol b2b b2b3 stratigraphic unit the apparent presence one fragment rodent radius sedimentary clast unit appear strong evidence unit thus also paleosol b2b b2b3 young rodent bone fragment 
the reality single bone fragment sedimentary clast exotic thus critical support evidence would helpful 
the abundant rodent bone material occur burrow outline argument age relation burrow paleosol stratigraphic unit indirect 
the argument bone material burrow burrow relate top unit paleosol b2b b2b3 rather modern surface hinge primarily depth burrow 
hall report near fallon nevada townsends ground squirrel home burrow adults great depth auxiliary burrow great depth 
the depth may auxiliary burrow modern surface trench site thus seem excessive suggests may relate modern surface 
burrow home burrow depth criterion would rule relation modern surface 
the absence caliche burrow bone tenas favor modern age bone 
indeed rodent burrow bone relate unit 
paleosol rather modern surface burrow may dig 
either near begin near end soil forming period period 
time could span thousand year 
unit must older 
burrow much old indeterminate 
might nearly 
contemporaneous example hundred year old could 
thousand year older 
thus bone burrow limit use

the argument best provide suggestion possible

flood deposition loess unit may complex process 
involve period deposition period deflation 
deposition deflation loess still proceed steeper 
slope remnant pre scarps whi cut

site floor

loess aerived 
the main period deflation lake bed 
must large part lake disappear time 
considerably later last high stand lake year 
however loess trench site may relate period 
major loess deposition

even transport sheet wash high bajada slope 
the age 
loess thus probably less year otherwise 
the soil horizon rna well develop must

predominantly sand size small dip northwestward near fault 
the fault rubble divide southeastern northwestern part 
the southeastern part consist pebble cobble matrix silt sand caliche 
many clast calcareous skin thick similar unit fracture cut rubble many highlight veinlets calcareous material particularly along southeast side rubble zone 
the northwestern part rubble generally finer grain consist mixture sand silt pebble cobble 
the northwestern part rubble less consolidated southeastern part subject cave 
the difference consolidation suggest late fault displacement confine northwestern part fault zone demonstrate lack displacement unit modern soil overlie southeastern part fault rubble 
fracture outside fault zone examine sign displacement 
fracture zone much wide near highlight caliche obscures unit boundary within fracture zone 
the unit cross fracture zone displace 
the fracture zone could trace surface bottom trench 
the lack displacement limit vertical extent suggest might form slump feature block northwest tilt toward open face fault scarp 
such feature common along scarp 
evidence open face apparent however fracture may form extension crack depth response tension across zone 
similar fracture 
this fracture seem offset contact unit unit offset 
the apparent offset may irregularity contact 
fault scarps almost entire length trench excavate degraded set scarp facet result repeated displacement fault

amount time displacement fault the amount time prehistoric displacement fault one principal goal project evidence age unit offset ambiguous indeterminate modern soil two sedimentary unit correlate certainty across fault 
nevertheless useful conclusion reach 
discuss displacement trench site unit displace prior least displacement occur formation paleosol b2b b2b3 deposition unit 
the evidence suggest displacement event late pleistocene holocene event part pleasant valley fault small probably less 
possible extrapolation base modern soil horizon rna base mud flow unit show figure 
the vertical component fault displacement occur base offset rna could 1ie table however postulate displacement great vertical component result serious difficulty section restore displacement size table 
such displacement require prior top unit bon northwest downhill side fault extend likely northwestward projection ground surface lie southeast fault 
displacement also require prior base rna high northwest downhill side fault southeast side highly unlikely configuration 
the evidence base rna top unit projection ground surface lie sout east fault thus indicate displacement vertical component this maximum evidence exclude possible displacement formation base rna 
discuss topography alone suggest vertical component reasonable extrapolation base unit indicate vertical component displacement fig 
the difference displacement indicate base rna suggest displacement occur deposition unit formation base rna 
the discussion regard displacement assume drag occur faulting 
some sedimentary unit soil 
steeper dip northwest fault far northwest moreover steeply dip part underlain fault rubble distribute faulting rubble would conducive flex overlie unit 
estimate effect drag dip unit fault adjust conform general dip unit far northwest horizon adjust accordingly 
figure adjust position base represent point adjust position base unit represent point the result estimate displacement table generally large estimate list table 
they also show difference 
13m displacement base unit band base suggest pre displacement unit 
whether drag occur trench site clear probably 
obvious disruption unit note postulated flex small could accomplish distributed intergranular movement small amount 
the best evidence question size displacement infer topography trench 
because irregularity grind surface displacement cannot closely determine method indicated range this amount closer estimate trench data displacement without drag table estimate displacement drag table 
the evidence give pre displacement unit support difference thickness unit two side fault 
unit generally thicker northwest fault southeast fault except near end trench 
possible explanation difference thickness unit deposit across fault scarp always thicker northwest unit although initially thickness side fault uplifted partly erode southeast fault 
unit deposit across fault scarp probably would thicker scarp normal thickness far downslope instead approximately thickness downslope fault 
deposition across fault scarp favor steep dip unit fault steeper dip could result fault drag 
under second explanation unit deposit less uniform thickness across fault time little topographic relief exist fault 
fault occur uplifted part unit partly erode 
one difficulty explanation manner erosion could accomplish 
the site near end flat top spur less wide small catchment area spur shallow channel top 
although present topography seem conducive much erosion environment permit transport silty gravel unit could permit subsequent erosion unit different condition rainfall
