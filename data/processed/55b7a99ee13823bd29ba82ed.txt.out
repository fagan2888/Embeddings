the low relief region scarcity good outcrop heavy brush cover combine make surface prospect difficult 
underground prospecting hamper irregularity fracture zone cinnabar find irregular distribution ore within zone 
mine do district geologic principle control deposition ore become well understood probably possible make good use geology guide development work 
the nature deposit however necessarily impose high cost prospecting development relative operation ore body regular shape 
the experience district far small scale operation use home factory make retort recover metal ordinarily unsuccessful 
occasionally one may run time profit never large profit tenor ore capacity retort tend prevent 
increase tenor ore mean increase labor mining cost ore must carefully hand sort 
would also increase amount rock discard waste proportion amount cinnabar lose waste 
the two great drawback furnace recover quicksilver arkansas district relatively high initial cost doubt insure supply ore begin operate 
the furnace give quick cheap recovery large amount ore retort 
permit treatment low grade ore thus decrease sort cost waste rock 
but must remember really block ore district ore bin actually show work face 
thus insure continuous operation furnace ore drawn enough different locality unproductive prospect way place ore furnace still come rest 
this mean either organization must control large number cinnabar occurrence furnace must operate custom basis 
the geologic feature describe report indicate ore deposit probably terminate depth cowhide thrust zone 
too little known attitude thrust fault predict depth surface place 
however crop 
southwestern arkansas quicksilver district 
apparently dip steeply southward even rather abrupt flatten would leave far depth yet reach mining operation 
there alternative possibility ore zone may accompany thrust zone southward 
possibly increase depth sulphide metal mercury become conspicuous 
summation geologic indication appear warrant prospecting development favorable area 
seem likely time national emergency cost object arkansas district could produce large amount quicksilver 
kecent operation district indicate quicksilver produce profit condition similar provide production maintain period long enough insure amortization relatively large capital investment 
suggestion fob prospector the thrust faults present know exist athens plateau quicksilver district 
the regional structural relation presence cinnabar locality outside mapped area suggest existence other least near quicksilver district 
analogy structural relation quicksilver district prospect mile wide zone south postulate thrust fault might disclose occurrence quicksilver 
within district cinnabar see many place rock outcrop 
would seem reasonable suppose welldefined area exists would long since discover 
hand remember know district discover spite fact region settle many year previously 
felt however present state knowledge geology region prospect belt know miner likely prove profitable search new cinnabar bearing area 
within district prospector search well fracture sandstone relatively close south thrust fault 
where stanley shale present south fault effort confine gap ridge sandstone member sandy zone shale 
the cross fold good guide many fracture zone 
east east end south woodall valley stanley cut greatly deform belt jackfork lie two branch thrust fault appear structurally unusually favorable area 
structurally vicinity tear fault appear favorable place prospect 
point date little development work do 
there good opportunity fracture zone develop along tear fault also 
contribution economic geology relatively good chance fault penetrate solution channel depth 
once cinnabar place find way safely open stay ore low relief throughout district generally mean relatively expensive work downward surface 
safe run adits idea intersect ore zone even short distance away 
the irregular nature fracture zone ore within zone make difficult block ore advance stoping 
this great handicap prospecting later mine operation 
large well financed organization might find feasible prospect likely fracture zone even cinnabar appear surface 
they also probably consider prospect deep along welldefined fracture zone even ore body work terminated 
there reason suppose ore body district confine within hundred foot surface 
the nature ore zone rock also discourage extensive prospect drilling 
the ore shoot irregular size shape attitude even closely spaced hole might reveal presence good ore shoot conversely slight chance drill hole might cut ore zone way make appear much large well really 
furthermore little shale ore find drill penetrate nearly vertical rock compose thin bed alternate sandstone shale would tend follow shale stratum rather sandstone 
the use short drill hole however may great use conjunction work determine extent ore body partly open
