introduction sdls design implement consensus participant researcher country collect multichannel seismic reflection mc data agency promote facilitate use mc data collaborative antarctic geoscience research 
the consensus statement guideline cooper adopt antarctic treaty consultative party atcm recommendation xvi 
since sdls actively acquire mc data data collector make data openly accessible collaborative research project focus principally structure stratigraphy evolution antarctic continental margin 
more recently data use decipher understanding antarctic paleoenvironments record characteristic seismic data 
tabulation mcs survey also use delineate monitoring seismic research study focus area know mammal activity ensure safe appropriate use seismic source 
the sdls differs data bank world data center several significant way affect way science activity conduct 
data bank simply provide data researcher request 
the sdls library system equitable guideline data may access use

the goal sdls provide data access promote facilitate geoscience collaboration 
this paper provide background current operational information sdls give example sdls use successful research tool community enhance collaboration earth science project range local circum antarctic scale 
the paper also highlight sdls ipy goal bring sdls fully date seek submission mc data due

this guideline fairly balance right individual data collector intellectual property mc data right science community access mc data mandate antarctic treaty 
the sdls guideline simply state within first year data collection data collector exclusive use mc data year data collection data use collaborative study data collector year data collection mc data make openly available use without restriction due acknowledgement data collector
