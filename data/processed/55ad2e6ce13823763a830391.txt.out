high urbanization 
water three stream high concentration calcium magnesium sulfate chloride 
stream drain piedmont crystalline rock show wide range chemical constituent 
the large diagram mineralize water occur heavily urbanized fall church area 
relatively high concentration magnesium sulfate chloride characterize urbanized area 
the remainder crystalline rock terrane characterize low concentration constituent fairly even balance different ion pair show plate 
diagram show piney branch vienna high sodium chloride concentration would require excessively large diagram show map 
stream drain area triassic rock sugarland run horsepen run little rocky run cub run 
these area heavily populate water high concentration dissolve solid county large diagram plate 
this due fact ground water discharge triassic rock mineralize county typically hard high sulf ate water deep well 
turn mineralized water triassic rock reflect presence soluble mineral calcite possibly gypsum plus longer transit time circulate ground water 
the northern section triassic area typify calcium magnesium bicarbonate water stream whereas southern section show calcium magnesium sulfate chloride water 
the diagram plate show effect urbanization stream quality conjunction map chemical quality ground water fairfax county larson show similarity ground water chemistry surface water chemistry less populated area 
comparison make use react value cation anion order compare ion equivalent base 
table show percentages constituent chemical balance 
these percentage plot trilinear diagram piper facilitate comparison different water show figure 
the figure show good grouping cation low leave triangle

the water triassic drainage area show great variation composition no 
high concentration sulfate plus chloride typify water southern traissic basins high concentration bicarbonate plus carbonate typify water northern triassic basin

comparison stream drain urbanized unurbanized area geologic terrane indicate high dissolved solid concentration water urbanized area 
the great influence geology water quality observe stream drain triassic rock 
this cause great solubility carbonate material traissic sandstone shale compare less soluble mineral granite gneiss schist etc
