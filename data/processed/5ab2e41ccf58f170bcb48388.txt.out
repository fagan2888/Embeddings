since show next section second generalize ham weight qr24 qr24 two codewords qr24 swe type support one scalar multiple 
this imply support codewords swe type qr24 make yield simple design

discrete mathematics 
implies codewords constant ham weight form design possibly repeat block 
criterion simple design need criterion decide whether design obtain use assmus mattson type approach simple 
provide two criterion 
the ÿrst one contain lemma follow utilizes minimum hamming distance code 
the second often informative criterion second generalize ham weight 
let linear code length minimum hamming distance 
suppose two codewords support size 
then must scalar multiple small integer 
for non zero deÿne there total nine nontrivial linear combination form 
these classiÿed accord number new zero coordinate position linear combination attain case introduce new zero position 
case introduce new zero position 
case introduce new zero position 
case introduce new zero position 
from four case conclude always exist linear combination least additional zero coordinate position 
since linear combination also codeword must zero vector thus prove lemma 
this lemma apply quaternary golay code qr24 tell two codewords ham weight less share support must necessarily scalar multiple 
this cient however guarantee design obtain theorem simple involves codewords ham weight 
knowledge second generalize ham weight case tell hold true case ham weight well 
since able ÿnd second generalize ham weight qr24 literature derive weight hierarchy qr24 
weight hierarchy qr24 two useful lemma ÿrst present 
discrete mathematics lemma wei 
the binary golay code g24 follow weight hierarchy lemma yang helleseth 
let linear code dual code 
then the lemma well lemma use derive weight hierarchy lift golay code qr24 
the weight hierarchy lift golay code qr24 proof 
lemma self duality qr24 qr24 qr24 since qr24 qr24 follow multiset contain weight hierarchy remain ÿnd qr24 
clearly qr24 one 
suppose qr24 
this possible support codeword swe type contain support codeword swe type 
however impossible accord g24 lemma 
suppose next qr24 
this possible union support codewords swe type swe type size impossible accord g24 lemma 
suppose qr24 
this possible support codeword swe type contain support codeword swe type 
since g24 two codewords cannot position 
two codewords four position swe type sum two codewords impossible 
result get qr24 implies qr24 qr24 qr24 qr24
