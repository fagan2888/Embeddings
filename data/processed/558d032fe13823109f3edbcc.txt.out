summary and conclusion 
summary and conclusion three dimensional finite difference digital flow model develop simulate ground water flow coastal plain aquifer system north carolina cover area mi2 
the layer model develop hydrogeologic framework make alternate sequence aquifer confine unit dip thicken seaward direction 
the model code use three dimensional finite difference ground water flow model model area divide rectangular grid layer vary space represent area range mi2 mi2 
the grid boundary condition mathematical numerical model design compatible regional model entire northern atlantic coastal plain 
western eastern boundary model layer treat flow boundary 
the eastern boundary assume along line equal concentration dissolve chloride 
boundary state line virginia north south carolina south specify flux boundary flux provide regional model 
the upper boundary confine aquifer bottom associate confine unit treat head dependent flux boundary 
for model whole upper boundary layer represent stream constant head boundary low boundary either bedrock saltwater bearing aquifer flow boundary 
the treatment line represent chloride concentration flow boundary valid area affect pump valid effect pump extend boundary part beaufort black creek upper cape fear lower cape fear lower cretaceous aquifer 
area model tend predict great drawdown would actually occur 
model input consist transmissivity storage coefficient aquifer confine unit streambed leakance ground water recharge water table stream surface altitude boundary flux rate pumpage 
for transient simulation pump period start running use 
pump period range length year first pump period year last pumping period 
number calibration simulation make purpose test well model able reproduce measure water level aid indicate adjustment model parameter need 
the primary parameter adjust leakance confine unit lesser extent transmissivity aquifer 
during calibration procedure compute hydrographs compare observe hydrographs 
also compute potentiometric surface various pump period check actual water level data 
adjustment model parameter make careful consideration whether adjustment could justify base data hydrogeologic ground water flow system 
the large change estimate leakance confine unit consider reasonable initial value parameter know less certainty parameter 
for calibrate model maximum transmissivity ft2 part castle hayne aquifer 
the small vertical hydraulic conductivity confine unit calibrate model 1xlo part low cape fear confine unit 
simulation indicate barrier flow exist vicinity landward reentrant water contain dissolve chloride upper low cape fear aquifer cape fear arch wilmington area 
the barrier probably cause high hydraulic head two aquifer southwest arch southeastern north carolina northeastern south carolina 
the nature barrier need research likely due either diminish hydraulic conductivity area presence salty water 
the relatively large block size make difficult accurately simulate configuration water table sand hill area 
thus model probably less accurate area area north carolina coastal plain 
sensitivity analysis indicate model especially sensitive change transmissivity area pump occurs regionally model uniformly sensitive leakance confine unit 
sensitivity model change storage coefficient confine aquifer slight transmissivity great near pumping center 
under predevelopment condition average recharge precipitation surficial aquifer vary areal area clay soil area sandy soil 
most move directly stream move downward confine aquifer system 
generally recharge confine aquifer system take place mostly updip interstream area discharge occurred stream stream valley downdip coastal area 
hydrologic analysis aquifer system base simulation indicate overall water budget change little predevelopment condition development condition 
pumpage large user increase zero ft3 
regional aquifer system analysis northern atlantic coastal plain 
period amount percent recharge ground water system ft3 
simulation result indicate water lose aquifer system pump largely offset reduction base flow stream lesser extent reduction aquifer storage 
contribution aquifer storage ft3 percent pumpage 
although effect pump overall water budget relatively small water level north carolina coastal plain aquifer system decline dramatically part aquifer since location due pumping stress 
the three principal area long term decline water level lower cretaceous low cape fear aquifer northeastern north carolina response withdrawal franklin low cape fear upper cape fear black creek aquifer central north carolina coastal plain pump occurs several site beaufort castle hayne aquifer beaufort county large withdrawal open pit phosphate mining chemical manufacturing 
since water level decline less surficial a10 yorktown aquifer also true updip part aquifer major withdrawal occur 
simulation year percent annual increase withdrawal pump location give virtually result simulation two shallow aquifer updip part aquifer 
the year simulation indicate significant local water level decline lower confine aquifer cell basis top aquifer 
direction vertical flow confine unit alter many area since 
vertical ground water flow confine unit generally downward interstream area upward major stream valley coastal area 
ground water pumpage substantially alter pattern several area 
the widespread change cause ground water move downward pumped aquifer area move upward predevelopment time 
area downward movement commonly occur major stream valley 
area downward movement also extend far coastward confine unit overlie extensively develop aquifer
