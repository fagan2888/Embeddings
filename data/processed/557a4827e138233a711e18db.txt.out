introduction roger head conference chair alaska department transportation public facility anchorage alaska conference entitle earthquake alaska be prepared 
hold anchorage alaska november 
earthquake alaska new concept public education short long term hazard associate seismic activity urban center 
the conference focus similarity two sister community one experienced recent devastating impact recent earthquake 
the experience wide range community infrastructure present numerous local professional 
bring experience one community another compare attitude plan professional provide much realistic often surprising perspective multitude problem second community might face similar event strike 
the conference hold anchorage community well aware earthquake hazard 
one large record earthquake strike southcentral alaska cause several hundred million dollar damage 
since anchorage shake literally hundred small earthquake none cause significant damage 
anchorage modem relatively young community 
settle experience little growth world war 
most new structure comply seismic requirement uniform building code 
the need sturdy construction dictate colder climate together prohibitive cost importing material associate seismic unsafe unreinforced masonry structure result construction building relatively earthquake resistant 
however part anchorage highly susceptible earthquake induce ground failure 
since earthquake damage alert public potential hazard 
although earthquake major blow anchorage serve poor illustration magnitude problem community expect today respond similar event 
anchorage small community resident population 
the big industry military support elmendorf air force base fort richardson army base 
anchorage consider pioneer community 
most resident relatively self sufficient use site fuel oil wood heating always prepared power outage occur regular basis 
only small part community public sewer water 
most resident site well septic tank 
today anchorage quite different community 
the population grow city urban horizon high rise building 
the modernization anchorage eliminate self sufficient system prevalent 
the community depend public lifeline natural gas electricity public sewer water freeways complete grade separate interchange 
for reason anchorage perhaps well prepared impact destructive earthquake 
the earthquake alaska conference compare anchorage santa cruz county california particular city santa cruz watsonville loma prieta 
although community distinctly different geographically many disaster related commonality 
the population santa cruz county compose mix urban rural community life style 
the city santa cruz largely compose middle upper middle class population average education level 
location university california santa cruz 
anchorage similar sociologic makeup center university alaska anchorage 
santa cruz consider remote california standard 
fact single road access across santa cruz mountains key factor delay deployment state national assistance loma prieta earthquake 
anchorage isolate rapid major outside assistance 
while type isolation different response delay emergency similar 
earthquake alaska conduct four half day session 
session establish earthquake hazard set geographic region 
this session provide basis comparison ofthe similarity difference seismic environment hazard ofthe two region

set the scene historic seismic alaska charlotte row deputy state seismologist geophysical institute university alaska fairbanks john davy go give brief overview alaska earthquake earthquake potential source 
go get detailed technical want give general introduction deal term seismic hazard alaska 
would like begin state earthquake occur worldwide produce result move crustal plate earth surface 
there many active seismic zone around world 
alaska part one seismic active area boundary pacific north american plate 
figure map large earthquake alaska 
the dots picture represent epicenter earthquakes magnitude large occur alaska since turn century 
there earthquake see figure 
most figure 
earthquake ofmagnitude large alaska 
the three size ofdots represent earthquake ofmagnitudes respectively 
line indicatefaults 
notice anchorage cook inlet alaska peninsula aleutian area 
fact percent seismic alaska occur region 
about percent seismic occur southeast alaska interior get percent state earthquake 
alaska earthquake information center typically record earthquake per week alaska magnitude great 
because network cover alaska peninsula aleutian islands densely central part state unable locate earthquake small along active plate margin 
thus safe say number earthquake occur easily twice report 
figure another map show number thing 
the sausage shape area represent rupture zone area fail different earthquake 
also show year earthquake occur 
the size rupture zone roughly proportional magnitude earthquake 
big earthquake area go rupture 
the blank segment figure represent call seismic gap 
seismic gap region appear rupture recently 
therefore potential great deal stress build area result shift plate earth crust 
the stress relieve either side gap large earthquake nothing appear happen within gap 
there number different interpretation may go seismic gap 
could region within gap relieve stress quietly 
could stress building concern likelihood significant earthquake occur gap sometime soon 
rupture zone oflarge underthrusting earthquake hachured area year occurrence indicate 
small box represent subsequent small earthquake 
note rupture zone earthquake superimpose rupture zonefor event 
the epicenter two event separate year nearly location 
modifiedfrom mccann other fig

you may notice look chart california part unite state typically consider earthquake country appear 
alaska demonstrably seismic active california 
figure highlight comparison alaska california seismic 
the bar chart breakdown year number significant magnitude great earthquake alaska compare california 
alaska significantly high number every year 
some discrepancy account great extent plate margin contain alaska even allow alaska would higher rate activity california 
this result difference tectonic setting john davy discuss talk 
go move talk particular earthquake effect 
the star map figure show epicenter main shock earthquake 
the square show south southwest represent aftershock magnitude large occur course subsequent day earthquake 
the aftershock define region consider rupture zone part plate margin fault fail earthquake 
this rupture zone extend kilometer southwest main shock 
the earthquake result permanent ground deformation large tsunamis great deal property damage loss life subsequent speaker today elaborate 
the earthquake unimak island fig 
produce tsunami destroy lighthouse scotch cap 
today would see would bare hint 
alaska california

vertical bar represent number event ofmagnitude large 
data compile steve est 
foundation foot thick foot tall reinforce concrete wall 
the tsunami order foot high 
interesting thing particular earthquake although surface wave magnitude magnitude recalculate base estimation size tsunami number closer arrived magnitude earthquake 
there speculation part contribution water displacement produce wave submarine landslide 
this may explain difference instrument measure magnitude estimate tsunami magnitude 
there earthquake lituya bay produce one phenomenal example sea wave ever occur 
visit lituya bay today would see bare rock face head bay scar landslide cause shake earthquake 
the landslide fell water produce wave whose amplitude height run order foot 
all tree hillsides completely wipe slope level foot along side bay 
the wave actually wash island middle bay take fishing boat top island 
there phenomenal first person account survivor boat regard observation wave water come rush 
the significant thing earthquake thing tie occurrence tsunami largely result secondary effect landslide arise result earthquake 
this spectacular example exactly thing happen valdez 
main shock large aftershock alaska earthquake 
the main shock represent large star moment magnitude of9 
aftershock ofmagnitude large show box 
the aftershock region define rupture zone kilometer long 
please note figure aftershock zone earthquake magnitude 
the andreanoff island earthquake magnitude epicenter exactly place 
although aftershock zone much small event small earthquake magnitude still pretty hefty shock 
the lesson simply assume large earthquake particular area potential another large earthquake place near future 
year earthquake 
anchorage complacent seismic risk earthquake magnitude similar andreanof island event year ago

motion culprit 
that cause earthquake alaska aleutian zone queen charlotte fairweather zone along southeastern part alaska 
indeed motion pacific plate relative north america cause earthquake california 
direct tie theme seminar underlie cause earthquake california alaska 
calculate motion occur rate approximately centimeter per year 
want take little digression show one measurement think rather spectacularly demonstrate fact case measure annual basis 
this measurement call long baseline interferometry vlbi carry radiotelescopes us radio wave come distant stellar object quasar 
the advantage use distant object essentially plane wave front wave pass two radiotelescopes span distance want measure 
turn make measurement calculate distance radiotelescopes precision order centimeter 
precise geodetic measurement available time 
measure large distance

important answer question 
that important outstanding research area 
need know big earthquake could fact occur fault 
the crustal region anchorage main thrust zone necessarily associate one fault could also contain buried fault know subsidence epicenter mile figure 
area ofmeasurable vertical ground deformation associate earthquake top profile deformation along line bottom 
note maximum uplift ofapproximately foot montagu island 
modifiedfrom plafker 
most geoscientists assume bury fault could generate magnitude earthquake anchorage area 
again fault load 
that strain energy accumulate around motion pacific plate 
one faults castle mountain border range portion shallow thrust zone region crust could fail essentially time 
could tomorrow 
could hundred year 
make forecast 
say tomorrow go earthquake 
but strain energy accumulate sense charlotte indicate make comparison earthquake aleutian 
there enough strain energy accumulate region earthquake generate magnitude great earthquake anchorage area 
finally table compilation earthquake magnitude great occur near anchorage 
these event occur 
the average interval something like year 
quite conceivable another magnitude earthquake vicinity anchorage could occur essentially anytime 
earthquake ofmagnitude great within kilometer mile ofanchorage since 
average recurrence interval year 
date jan may nov mar 
magnitude interval year average 
the main message want leave anchorage earthquake country 
and long interval magnitude earthquake relax belief experience damage earthquake lifetime 
magnitude earthquake could occur essentially anytime

question audience combellick john think source magnitude event feel frequently around anchorage 
davy well occur either crustal area point actually within pacific plate 
the majority intermediate size earthquake moderates earthquake actually occur within pacific plate anchorage 
those small fault within brittle part subducting plate 
often kilometers deep either cook inlet north like talkeetna 
that major source seismic activity 
one thing point something order percent destructive earthquake occur california occur fault structure identify capable fault 
and true california probably geologist every square kilometer half earthquake occur structure forecast surprise earthquake occur anchorage area structure identify 
questioner basic novice earthquake 
but talk able measure displacement plat plate assume fixed mass compress expand 
mean move one solid block compare like north american plate 
davy assume purpose short term interferometry interpretation rigid fact exactly rigid 
but relative motion plate north america pacific plate move essentially rigid body 
there significant amount internal deformation 
but order magnitude less relative motion plate 
deformation plate order say centimeter 
the deformation within plate order millimeter less 
questioner but mean entire pacific plate measure movement anchorage yakutat wherever mean would end kind relative movement compare japan hawaii 
davy that correct 
fact kinds measurement make 
compare vandenburg air force base relative fairbanks yakutat relative fairbanks get kind number 
yakutat relative fairbanks centimeter per year 
and vandenburg air force base relative fairbanks centimeter per year 
and westward side main plate boundary fault separate pacific north american plate 
questioner one last question 
what depth plate 
davy their thickness order kilometer 
questioner all right 
hudson ken hudson matanuska susitna borough 
and question relative rise fall land subsidence raise effect 
susitna borough would north american plate guess 
and question long term planning perspective large earthquake expect uplift 
river water body issue go significant rise foot go severe problem deal 
davy one thing motion reverse interim earthquake 
happen earthquake area squeeze area immediate area around cook inlet uplift 
during earthquake area pop back south uplift reverse area subsides 
net effect much small long term 
questioner last slide picture eagle river fault 
could tell 
davy the eagle river fault remember right part extension border range system 
fault study quite bit 
and clear current capability fault 
there people think capable generate major earthquake people think 
still subject lot research 
geologic evidence earthquake frequency southcentral alaska rodney combellick chief engineering geology section alaska division geological geophysical survey fairbanks alaska how likely another major subduction earthquake anchorage region lifetime useful life engineer structure 
the answer question express term probability 
for example know major earthquake occur average every year give percent probability occurrence within year period 
hand occur every year probability within year period go percent this kind information would useful decide whether use costly design construction practice reduce earthquake risk propose structure 
the problem anchorage area region one great earthquake historic time great earthquake one magnitude large great alaska earthquake 
determine historic record often big earthquake occur 
fortunately geologic record give clue often major earthquake occur least past year 
use carbon date get rough idea time earthquake effect estimate average frequency occurrence 
understand geology use determine frequency big earthquake let first examine permanent geologic record leave event

our subsidence data cook inlet area geological survey uplift data gulf alaska coastal area allow come general conclusion long term earthquake frequency region affect event 
the regional evidence suggest six eight earthquake prior past year 
therefore average recurrence interval great earthquakes period year 
second interval event range less year saw portage boreholes much year 
although great earthquake think occur sufficient time elapse strain reaccumulate historic case notably south japan alaska andreanof islands great earthquake occur within year previous one area 
assume next great earthquake go wait another year even year 
third strong regional evidence several submerge marsh upper cook inlet several uplifted location gulf alaska last great earthquake sometime year ago 
use term great earthquake rather loosely really way determine magnitude prehistoric earthquake geologic data 
know worldwide data subduction earthquake take minimum magnitude cause widespread permanent vertical deformation 
also eight earthquake magnitude record northern part region affect earthquake figure 
view lower tidal bank girdwood extreme low tide 
four peat layer pre date layer submerge exposed bank indicate arrow 
radiocarbon date place age ofprehistoric subsidence roughly year ago 
the geologist collect sample year old peat 
since begin century 
none earthquake know result measurable permanent vertical deformation 
think consider reasonable minimum magnitude ofprehistoric earthquake evidence ofuplift subsidence likely preserve geologic record 
from size region evidence event year ago estimate magnitude must least 
feel probably much large probably similar magnitude earthquake 
because geologic record say little nothing magnitude need consider preserve evidence earthquake probably represent large earthquake perhaps similar event 
the recurrence interval small great earthquake magnitude range could much short year average suggest geologic data

comparison knowledge earthquake potential the san francisco bay and anchorage region robert page branch seismology geological survey menlo park california introduction ask compare knowledge earthquake potential san francisco bay region anchorage region 
this instructive exercise contrast level understand achieve intensively studied area namely san francisco bay region region great geologic complexity pace study much slow 
talk give idea stand term understand quantify earthquake potential anchorage region comparison achieve san francisco bay region 
want leave two primary idea first geologic seismic investigation scientist gain sufficient understand earthquake process make useful quantitative statement future earthquake potential 
this emerge capability perhaps best illustrated recent progress quantify earthquake potential san francisco bay region 
second level understand regard future earthquake potential anchorage region lag far behind san francisco bay region 
however engage earthquake investigation alaska optimistic progress make although pace slow relation importance problem 
begin talk compare geologic set historical seismic two region 
then discuss recent estimate earthquake probability san francisco bay region 
conclude review level knowledge regard earthquake potential anchorage region 
compare the two region anchorage san francisco sit boundary pacific north american plate 
the pacific plate move northwestward respect north american plate 
along southcentral coast alaska two plate converge inch per year 
belt earthquake encircle pacific ocean 
the belt wide southern alaska relative central california 
this reflect different tectonic situation two region 
alaska pacific plate thrust beneath southern edge continent gentle angle 
this type underthrusting produce great earthquake magnitude prince william sound kodiak island region 
central california pacific plate slipping 
horizontally past north american plate 
there major earthquake occur vertical rather shallow dip fault coastal alaska 
this difference dip plate boundary fault reflect size large earthquake two region 
plate boundary fault capable generate earthquake depth mile great depth plate slide past one another smoothly without cause earthquake along boundary 
accordingly faults vertical central california width earthquake rupture measure earth exceed mile 
contrast plate boundary dip gently width large mile earthquake rupture 
thus boundary fault width alaska several time california 
this account much size difference large earthquake 
term energy alaska earthquake roughly hundred time large san francisco shock 
the difference geologic set also result california fault accessible study 
they intersect ground surface see eye happen 
you measure long term rate slip across fault obtain idea relative activity fault 
this possible fault bury surface main fault break alaska earthquake 
this factor contribute difference status level ofknowledge two region 
now let compare number earthquake large magnitude two state 
southern alaska record earthquake history date back series big earthquake large magnitude occur vicinity yakutat bay 
california mission establish late 1700s history go back additional century 
the historical record indicate magnitude shock three time frequent southern alaska california 
the relatively short history alaska mean know less recurrence rate earthquakes alaska california shock 
rod combellick discuss obtain information geologic record help decipher longterm rate earthquake occurrence 
earthquake probabilities the san francisco bay region go focus san francisco bay region serious earthquake problem 
you might ask problem severe earthquake large frequent southern alaska 
the answer san andreas fault branch pass adjacent heavily urbanized area 
san francisco abuts san andreas fault oakland cut hayward fault san jose lie two fault 
thus two major fault traverse heavily urbanized bay region 
the loma prieta earthquake magnitude rupture mile section san andreas fault southern santa cruz mountains sparsely populated region san jose santa cruz 
santa cruz watsonville two heavily damage city lie mile fault 
great deal destruction however see national television occur oakland san francisco mile 
total people kill 
property damage estimate billion 
the problem bay area fault east bay san francisco peninsula lie much closer major urbanized region fault segment cause loma prieta disaster 
compare population expose intense shaking similar 
size future earthquake southern part hayward fault loma prieta shock 
about million people live within region intense shake hayward fault earthquake time number within sized region around loma prieta rupture 
hence loss expect much great future earthquake comparable magnitude 
obviously serious problem 
how address problem 
until recently difficult confront earthquake problem know little frequently damage shock likely occur 
the situation change california 
the result recent geologic seismic study enable make useful statement likelihood damage earthquake future time interval say year period time span many economic decision make 
after loma prieta earthquake reexamine probability various sized earthquake occur bay region

the magazine significant impact 
alert lot homeowner seriousness earthquake threat cause discuss thing prepare earthquake 
but think encouraging fact business really begin take account probability earthquake planning decision 
now let consider generate probability estimate 
there five question need address regard earthquake potential 
the first one active fault 
bay region san andreas principal actor hayward secondranked fault 
there fault three quarter plate boundary motion bay region accommodate san andreas hayward fault together 
principal culprit 
the next question fault segment 
not necessarily entire fault rupture earthquake maybe part 
this important issue size earthquake increase proportion length fault segment slip earthquake 
bay region san andreas fault divide three segment capable generate earthquake magnitude large fig 
similarly hayward fault include northern extension rodgers creek fault three segment capable magnitude shock fig 
answer third question large earthquake come length fault segment also historical record 
important understand one 
fault segment may rupture single earthquake 
for example san francisco earthquake rupture north coast segment san andreas north city also peninsula segment south city fig 
the last two question how frequently large earthquake occur last one 
from geodetic survey bay region know long term average slip rate part san andreas fault inch per year 
and hayward fault inch per year 
knowledge average slip rate fault enables estimate long take stress rock two side fault accumulate breaking point 
then know fault segment last break estimate next rupture 
the long historical record tell last large earthquake hayward fault segment fig

knowledge date back time except place aleutian island 
rogers creek fault know last large shock occur geologic evidence suggest early 
thus answer five question able provide useful statement regard probability future damage earthquake specific time window fig 
how use type information regard earthquake potential 
sufficient say certain probability particular size earthquake go occur 
what also need statement intensity duration ground shake different locality 
compare expected level shake future bay area earthquake shake experienced loma prieta earthquake 
santa cruz intensity shake future earthquake probably exceed loma prieta earthquake 
the shake example magnitude peninsula segment san andreas fault 
oakland however segment hayward fault traverse city rupture level shaking expect times great experienced oakland loma prieta earthquake 
many building suffer damage oakland recent earthquake 
level knowledge the anchorage region let jump back alaska 
the large earthquake threaten anchorage region occur along plate boundary 
the entire boundary along coast southern alaska rupture series magnitude great earthquake last year except section kayak island icy bay fig 
this area refer yakataga seismic gap 
generate major earthquake since 
earth scientist regard seismic gap likely site next magnitude earthquake southern alaska 
the gap could rupture within next decade single magnitude alternatively series large magnitude earthquake 
additional uncertainty regard yakataga seismic gap whether earthquake rupture begin area stop eastern edge rupture whether would rupture part fault segment 
know answer 
the yakataga seismic gap large distance anchorage mile 
for reason magnitude location would large direct impact anchorage although large tall structure likely set motion 
the plate boundary segment close anchorage break second large earthquake century worldwide 
uncertain whether segment break magnitude type shock 
fault segment produce magnitude event one occasion might also capable generate series magnitude shock different subsection segment another time interval 
such magnitude shock might occur frequently to800 year interval suggest recurrence size earthquake 
anchorage sit underthrust pacific plate 
beneath city gently dip boundary separate north american pacific plate depth mile fig 
section plate boundary capable generate big earthquake 
significant shaking generate sudden slip section plate boundary 
the significant shaking originate slip seaward shallow section plate boundary 
time feel unlikely large earthquake could occur section plate boundary anchorage 
far address plate boundary earthquake 
there type shock threaten anchorage fig 
one type occur fault within part pacific plate thrust beneath continent 
most earthquake felt anchorage resident originate underthrust pacific plate fig

this process give rise volcano star alaska peninsula west side cook inlet 
contrast along coast southeast alaska two plate slide horizontally past along san andreas fault california

these earthquake shake good shelf valdez cause minor cracking structure severe damage 
again shock mile valdez

another category earthquakes occur override north american plate fig 
unlike san francisco bay region active fault map south central alaska 
fact castle mountain fault know active fault map within mile radius anchorage 
the castle mountain fault approach within mile city fig 
where fault cross susitna lowlands exhibit clear scarp sign recent geological movement fault 
geologic study show least foot horizontal slip last thousand year however possess information fault long term slip rate 
thus cannot evaluate likelihood castle mountain fault produce damage earthquake next year active fault san francisco bay region

entire castle mountain fault break single event magnitude earthquake would 
two large historical earthquake locate susitna lowland fig 
top origin remain uncertain

the precision earthquake location time sufficient preclude possibility occur castle mountain fault 
research underway examine old earthquake see attribute particular fault 
the shock may override plate possibly castle mountain fault follow lot aftershock

need understand origins activity know whether potentially damaging shock could originate area 
finally state find seismic evidence indicate border range fault active fig 
whether fault active critical question close anchorage 
accordingly cautious conclude absence small earthquake relatively short interval geologic time fault incapable generate damage earthquake future 
summary summary know anchorage serious earthquake problem 
unfortunately current level knowledge region sufficient make reliable estimate earthquake probability specific fault do san francisco bay region 
however geologic seismological study could accelerate next decade two could look forward reliable quantitative estimate future earthquake potential anchorage region early next century

question comment audience updike name randy updike 
one question two concern large plate boundary earthquake 
possible couple large earthquake short time interval say within year 
possible would type investigation conduct rod reveal geological evidence event say like one occur year ago 
page let answer first part possible 
exact repeat earthquake within decade think possible 
but two section plate boundary one recently rupture great earthquake adjacent one rupture recently earthquake start portion lock longer fault break may propagate recently rupture section 
this possibility suggest northeastern end fault rupture 
there evidence uplift wave cut terrace middleton island uplift nearly great elevation difference old terrace 
this suggest short time compare time require wave cut new terrace middleton island may uplift another earthquake 
underlie assumption uplift occur last thousand year 
combellick answer part question regard geologic evidence large event 
mention appear may evidence portage two earthquake occur close together time 
the evidence really strong however see couple site 
fortunately though disturbance occur geologic section 
know two event portage separate apparently brief period time 
the resolution carbon date technique limit would allow resolve short time difference event 
fact evidence age range estimate two separate location would difficult show disturbance represent two separate event 
the fact evidence come one geologic section show two event portage 
the error range event year resolve time would difficult 
questioner know lot sort thing maybe question dumb 
but tell plate basically solid mass 
migrate reasonably fix rate 
confuse slip along fault line 
place along fault line weak spot keep get deform finally rupture 
instant two side fault move relative one another mile away fault move 
page that basically picture 
what happen plat contact strain edge plate 
you actually measure geodetically 
you determine ground say compress extend 
strain energy store edge plat way energy store rubber band 
earthquake occurs force result strain plate overcome friction fault normally keep plate slip 
then sudden slip segment fault 
this release strain energy store rock along segment fault 
rubber band analogy let one end rubber band snap back original shape 
thus border plate undergo repetitive elastic straining relaxation 
edge plat energy store big earthquake 
contrast interior plat generally behave relatively rigid fashion like block 
questioner still little bit confused idea plate slide horizontally past along san andreas fault converge one thrust beneath southern alaska 
mile area along san andreas deforms earthquake break entire length fault 
page the character deformation along plate boundary change along course length 
when san andreas fault reach northern california plate boundary bifurcates cape mendocino 
from northward british columbia small oceanic plate lie pacific north american plate 
still far north along panhandle southeast alaska pacific north american plate contact along fairweather fault 
the fairweather fault horizontal slip like san andreas fault 
then start go around bend along gulf alaska purely horizontal motion plate longer possible 
the motion two plate becomes convergent edge plat undergo compression deformation earthquake occur pacific plate thrust beneath north american plate thus sense motion change horizontal california southeast alaska convergence seaward anchorage along eastern aleutian island 
combellick let add another answer 
the fact rupture occur isolated area mile length fault california anywhere els along boundary reflection fact plat entirely rigid 
various part interface plat lock different time 
you see strain accumulate 
during earthquake part deform plate relaxes strain shifted portion boundary

potential effect major earthquake structure the anchorage area john aho ch2m hill anchorage alaska what like take brief excursion world structural engineering define engineering term often hear 
illustrate example build damage result process like torsion pounding 
then relate building damage see area may happen anchorage 
structural engineer architect make one basic assumption design 
and ground stay build strong motion earthquake 
make basic assumption major problem 
show least one case basic assumption make 
they fact design building predict potential several foot vertical horizontal movement 
show opinion able 
start go term 
go talk simply building 
discus lifeline 
randy updike talk noon discus lifeline bridge port thing nature 
really relate information building environment 
some important design issue occupancy 
occupancy configuration architectural consideration 
but structural engineer really involved selection building configuration 
unfortunately normally 
typically architect set building configuration may irregular plan elevation expect engineering profession make thing work 
and could problematical sometimes 
worried type structural system use whether shear wall type system building frame 
worry structural detail improper detail seismic loading extremely dangerous 
typically seismic load always go much great load building actually design 
depend property call ductility absorb excess energy 
talk moment 
then worry nonstructural element 
many time nonstructural element indiscriminately place structure completely change reaction structure 
worry nonstructural element stiffen building point perhaps unsafe building 
many earthquake country find quality construction material lot failure building 
structural system talk weight structure 
talk different type structural frame whether frame brace frame shear wall 
these type thing worry design structure 
under seismic issue want take brief look major earthquake occur death result major earthquake 
concerned death concern type structure tend see fail earthquake earthquake 
you notice china earthquake tangshan china people kill 
that big one 
but really want look first earthquake fatality 
this give idea type building fail 
see collapse timber reinforce concrete building 
there lot fatality due fire 
and course collapse unreinforced masonry construction always problem area country lead lot death 
california lot legislation deal strengthen exist unreinforced masonry course build type structure anymore 
alaska little unreinforced masonry unless contractor get away something 
building code since really strengthen area masonry construction even though firmly believe high rise masonry really thing build earthquake country 
during interest collapse timber building 
but see real increase collapse reinforce concrete building 
that lot concrete construction go period 
really full understanding detail beam column connection would properly perform earthquake loading 
there big push concrete construction 
there lot high rise concrete building build 
lot fatality build failure type 
still see collapse masonry building big contributor fatality 
build sit stand place simply gravity load pull 
but talk earthquake force worry look vertical component earthquake load also look horizontal component 
when design building look horizontal earthquake force transverse longitudinal direction building 
the code really relate vertical earthquake force thing design building live dead load really take consideration type loading 
but really worried horizontal loading building 
and somewhat complicate 
building might respond like pendulum ground shake 
talk little bit response second 
configuration extremely important 
architect engineer work closely together make sure building configuration detrimentally affect response build earthquake 
when talk building configuration really worry whether irregular simple plan lot reentrant comer complicate plan 
when thing like reentrant corner induce stress earthquake loading pose major problem 
consider design problem seismic loading 
you similar problem building irregular elevation shape 
look vertical plan discontinuity take account irregularity 
long recognize problem really design 
past lot failure building people really recognize problem discontinuity 
show building later case 
this example build irregular plan view 
say unsafe building 
design modem code 
the engineer architect take consideration might happen reentrant comer area 
but irregular building 
this type building difficult design use simply uniform building code uniform building code really deal regular structure 
and really minimum standard design structure 
there serious damage irregular building support say sloped area different length piling 
flexibility varies cube ratio pile length 
pile twice long eight time flexible 
this mean short pile much stiffen pound load apply laterally short pile take pound load long one take pound 
recognize design account fact overload short pile 
pile size cross section could overload short pile unknowingly cause failure 
let talk little bit torsion 
earthquake force act center mass building center resistance may wall displace center mass 
center resistance resist force cause eccentric load building 
design simply horizontal load forget torsion load could design unconservative structure 
this penneys department store anchorage 
torsion probably one main contributor failure particular building earthquake stiff wall two side build fairly flexible wall side 
center mass center resistance displace 
there hellatious torsion load building cause failure 
hopefully redesign reconstruct take consideration 
let take real quick look pound drift 
when talk drift really talk far build move shake relative displacement story 
pound two building knock together essentially 
design tall building next short building really worry close building together move different frequency 
one building fact damage building strong motion event 
really worry aspect ratio building 
ideally like keep aspect ratio height width building around 
that give real stable structure 
these high aspect ratio building cause real problem design exterior column shake get hellatious compression load exterior 
the load come either direction 
course get hellatious compression load way around building 
you really worry problem 
this example mexico city particular building move different period tall building next 
severely damage tall building 
this building happen mid column height make even dangerous 
hope none building owner 
show illustrate couple thing normally 
you real soft story area 
the center resistance along side 
well displace center mass make building subject extreme torsion 
and short building probably within inch wall 
potential building shake pounding damage 
and pound damage occur mid column height soft story 
the reason worry drift happen drift far 
soft story situation upper wall much rigid 
they tend draw earthquake load 
this low floor flexible area 
see lot build failure type 
here one loma prieta shift 
again soft story compare upper floor 
worry drift object sit straight put force simply compress force object 
object start move compress force displace 
you compress force object eccentricity develop get torsion object also 
when talk ductility simply talk abut ability structure absorb energy 
talk able take excursion call inelastic deflection range 
ductility extremely important earthquake design design load much low actual anticipate load 
the period shake essentially long take something one cycle 
talk frequency talk number cycle within certain period time 
here example fundamental period might expect certain type structure 
here piece fasten equipment second period bridge period second 
tall building period order second 
shorter building single story period second 
the characteristic period build one tenth number story 
story build second period 
that give rough idea frequency tall building might 
this show simple way vary frequency structure 
flag pole something top low something change frequency 
low flag pole 
change shape flag pole 
change material flag pole 
finally change base flag pole 
all method use change frequency 
what worry earthquake design want building frequency frequency soil 
two frequency close together get resonance cause large deflection 
the site period tend reinforce building period 
theory resonance undamped item predict infinite displacement 
and course building trouble infinite displacement 
concerned mode vibration particular case short building 
single mode vibration 
get tall building mode vibration enter picture 
short structure anchorage interested probably first second mode ofvibration 
the goal uniform building code resist minor earthquake without damage moderate earthquake possibly architectural damage major earthquake without collapse 
remember say totally undamaged 
say without collapse 
want get people 
there new one want worry important structure want remain functional 
base shear essentially horizontal load come building ground level 
go distribute load height build calculate moment shear 
the base shear equation essentially force equal mass time accelera 
these type equation use calculate force building 
and mathematically distribute force building 
now talk base isolation 
normal building connect foundation ground normal manner get upward amplification force get whiplash effect move building 
you get rid lot many building isolate base 
you essentially free structure ground use seismic isolation system sort 
and do many place 
contrary popular belief building anchorage ball bearing 
this example building salt lake city utah public service building build 1900s expensive building really seismic vulnerable 
and want something 
freed building ground placing isolators 
first lift foundation ground put steel rubber isolators underneath 
million retrofit 
they cut expect ground acceleration building would experience and building fact take type loading 
there risk study do anchorage 
these result future earthquake damage area million death three four injury 
but give idea talk serious stuff far damage concern 
believe number death higher 
this type thing structural engineer solve massive ground slide ground failure split building 
look part area seem pretty well 
but handle 
site structure place like 
roof tear away concrete wall prevent new code 
but old building town situation roofs well connect 
could anticipate failure type 
during search rescue chinese earthquake find could get people quickly percent chance survival 
day progress chance survival extremely poor 
victim extraction debris removal area study really get start 
something anchorage really pay much attention think really 
anchorage prepare 
well see 
question comment audience schulz average feel like anchorage increase decreased vulnerability earthquake since event 
aho well definitely increase vulnerability several different reason 
two three call high rise structure story 
way westward hotel severe pound damage quake 
but lot high rise construction 
since build high rise 
built concrete construction 
build area opinion potential massive ground failure 
and increase vulnerability 
positive side also design modem building code 
and competent designer work building 
sure ahead game yet though

sometime talk folk work worry work place go happen computer telecommunication forth get acceleration 
go point finger individual building specific problem 
but idea try capture vulnerability exist broad picture magnitude vulnerability 
and course first thing look electrical power time year one significant aspect survival 
learn loma prieta power station one point woronzoff suffer particular problem due acceleration affect thing like insulator elevate tower 
these thing start bang short break loose support move horizontally 
sudden weak link shutdown power station occur 
home generator alaska become important time 
john aho point long tall thin structure vulnerability especially may resonance ground shake 
tower like particularly design type horizontal load problem telecommunication short circuit 
underground water sewer line every time major earthquake anywhere world water one serious impact earthquakes whether loma prieta earthquake california one mexico city south america 
water always serious problem one common side effect earthquake fire 
lose water supply quickly problem quell fire 
now reason point particular pipeline eklutna water pipeline 
hypothetical case go keep eklutna pipeline function ductile reinforce concrete 
the problem water supply show week later 
and reason show week later eklutna valley major landslide come dam river shut water supply 
even though pipeline keep function another side effect reduce capability 
anchorage international airport there real worry tower 
john also point build act like inverted pendulum 
roadway anchorage course critical 
movement around probably already observe dependent upon rather limited number route get certain part city 
and rely route stay open 
this happen build old landslide fact landslide extends lane 
get foot horizontal displacement foot vertical displacement area probably shut roadway least first hour 
here minnesota drive chester creek area transition rock fill bed come onto area build top silty clay 
period consolidation due shaking tendency differential subsidence cause separation occur 
now imagine put foot vertical separation road like probably shut use bmws porsches 
people today say you know really fine 
come fine 
but mentality lifestyle anchorage frontier town 
and look city change 
stay hotel downtown anchorage 
and look road watch vehicle go bimodal distribution 
there people car pickup 
lot people fall one two vehicular category reflect different lifestyle region 
word lifestyle change since 
cosmopolitan city whereas frontier town 
another aspect another vulnerability particularly anchorage see drive street see many overhead power line telephone pole wait fall earthquake 
although pose direct risk life limb knock traffic signal throughout city two third pose risk 
automobile get one place another 
also knock telephone pole communication vulnerable 
look around lot telephone pole anchorage still wood timber pole sit year tendency snap earthquake 
let look bridge minute 
live wasilla work anchorage 
one thing always concern fact one set bridge go wasilla palmer bridge get knocked get home neither could people 
the problem course alternative way get pretty much cloister people anchorage family wasilla 
bridge vulnerable major concern 
you may recall one big hangups week loma prieta earthquake effect earthquake bridge 
here bay bridge one span separate one section enough shut bridge 
this bridge go across knik river 
happen project bridge find bridge construction 
they piers beam ready bridge deck 
when earthquake occur sediment bridge liquefy caused pier slightly shift plumb enough girder long enough fit onto pier 
and put long girder 
would seem message tendency soon slight excursion earthquake inch drop span shut bridge 
another aspect one rather grim failure support hold bridge 
that one oakland 
and need start look bridge around support may vulnerable point 
accelerate thing strongly horizontally especially get little torsion bridge fail catastrophically 
torsion curve structure like single point support hazardous 
let look one bridge street viaduct 
build sand gravel tendency liquefy 
also hybrid look two separate big bridge link together 
one question hear engineer ask two bridge tendency behave independently could actually get pound two roadway 
railroad you may recall one tragic thing happen building railroad district partially cave overhead material fall inside loss life 
there significant advance make safe work place 
but remember go one big repair facility pretty hazardous consider big heavy stuff suspend propped 
railroad typically built place thing appropriate type construction allow 
for example area see railroad go landslide area 
this peters creek area landslide come every awhile even without earthquake 
suggest local earthquake whole piece 
railroad track would 
fact landslide material keep plow periodically clear track 
again vulnerable railway 
bridge go bridge support material liquefy 
these old trestle far know little consideration give whether sustain short period horizontal acceleration 
let anchorage port area 
the anchorage port area critical economic vitality anchorage southcentral alaska entry point material go interior alaska energy food raw material type 
problem port area go radiate whole economy 
earthquake engineering type port look vulnerable 
let start dock 
again locate highly liquefiable material material also high seismic amplification 
soft moist sediment take incoming energy wave amplify significantly shake would bedrock 
hillside versus port would experience much less shake would port area 
that impact thing like crane still remember picture container dock chile crane earthquake topple 
every one go easy get back tipped 
also shut port totally disaster especially try get supply reconstruction unload crane 
tank farm there damage port area result rupture tank 
what happen fluid inside tank start slosh get momentum set inside cause tank literally slosh apart 
bulge base 
and get rupture develop 
some tank problem without earthquake clearly appropriate think significant acceleration tank would rupture likely fire would break 
the thing leave port area drive around port area look sort plain look square building wonder kind activity involve 
there kinds hazardous chemical explosive material store port area 
for firefighting community think would nightmare three tank rupture petroleum product plus fire extend warehouse 
ruin lunch yet 
one thing leave port area 
just kind sideline 
one historic area think old residential neighborhood anchorage government hill area 
would like suggest government hill come pretty good except landslide 
but shallow nearby earthquake could get call topographic effect ridge become focus incoming seismic wave 
could actually sustain much high damage level little ridge say another place anchorage 
hypothetical case next monday go let fourth avenue landslide stay intact nothing happens 
fact go much happen big landslide local earthquake 
there enough duration 
this second second earthquake 
enough duration get big landslide go 
but still imagine thing like holiday inn sunshine plaza go pretty intense nonstructural damage inside exterior 
area like go low basin onto ridge basically along topographic edge tendency strong motion intense even block back behind 
also downtown area material tend amplify incoming seismic wave 
here tumagain slide 
go leave intact 
nothing happens 
new damage tumagain area leave tumagain tumagain elementary school side northern light tumagain slide area 
this build soft soil also area thick peat deposit 
would expect building like would experience substantial amplification substantial interior damage clock monday morning point concern anybody school district 
john aho point look area like downtown anchorage get kind variation type construction shape building fairly simple rectangular shape other complex 
there kinds variation damage building would experience 
let first look hospital bet monday afternoon hospital go overload 
humana hospital providence hospital feel would come well magnitude earthquake 
they construct quite well 
they good soil build good earthquake code 
this native hospital 
dave show picture landslide encroach native hospital 
one landslide another one 
and one landslide associate area could well take north wing particular hospital 
regardless whether landslide hit building certainly could experience superficial damage construction modem code 
this hospital elmendorf air force base 
this typify another point john make building transition height configuration vertically horizontally 
earthquake design carefully instituted element come together substantial problem 
would worry transition 
these look like masonry infill wall structural element 
you may see picture fracture piece infill fall 
wasilla convenience store 
the store pretty well 
there beer bottle shelve couple guy park lot start sober 
but one problem account picture gas pump protective roof single pillar 
the pillar shear roof go pump 
this result significant fire problem right main intersection center wasilla 
compound firehouse combination wood front back side concrete block side 
two relatively rigid wall 
two really flexible wall 
the roof come fire truck could get 
back downtown 
most big building see downtown right design either local engineer engineer lower rigorous building code 
know building downtown anchorage would particularly bother 
the street landslide area controversial big building put right front top part scarp 
the reason put independent ability building withstand strong motion think good example difference period building could real problem especially since mostly glass exterior 
they phase review john aho say 
building move phase particular time may accelerate towards could cause real problem fourth floor look window 
park garage this new parking garage downtown 
john aho tell could design garage withstand earthquake still depend upon soil underneath 
this derelict building 
you probably see 
this one go earthquake picture fracture window building 
and problem building like even though withstood earthquake know current strength whether point fail earthquake cease since doctor cosmetically look right 
almost ready fail magnitude 
there also problem old building like know one particularly 
but lot time build around year hard find plan actual construction quality go building 
reality necessarily reflect plan lay table 
this example reinforce concrete construction fairly typical throughout anchorage actually probably quite safe part 
the weakness building tie foundation concrete wall roof diaphragm 
and know rigorously thing pursue 
here example watch building construction 
this reinforce masonry building 
shop mall 
you see rebar projecting top 
without reinforcement nothing hold block together 
famous landmark anchorage restaurant would really worried magnitude earthquake mile anchorage want eat pie 
might end pie face 
again old masonry building like know whether sufficient reinforcement construction 
new shopping mall flexible diaphragm roof rigid wall flex phase result collapse part roof 
this one wasilla 
this mall south anchorage build area thick peat deposit overlie soft silt clay 
this may show maximum soil amplification questionable performance roof relative wall earthquake 
this new construction right ship creek flood plain area would experience liquefaction problem strong amplification 
amplification would occur two reason one underlain soft soil 
the sit top topographic basin energy come tendency focus 
the anchorage jail facility this jail annex post road second avenue 
well design facility excellent engineering facility 
the problem jail build landslide landslide move 
drive second avenue right find municipality occasionally repair street slide keep move without earthquake 
now raise think really serious issue facility like people incarcerate 
foot horizontal displacement back wall pop loose could pose serious social hazard outside community 
also public responsibility people behind locked door 
sustain injury escape would serious reflection public obligation 
monday morning earthquake occur magnitude 
everybody work seismologist start watch seismograph carefully watch pattern aftershock 
for california remember one big thing worry main shock end earthquake build something big 
what go happen 
becomes important public sector government closely communication possibility continue event 
often main earthquake 
you hear today 
becomes important consider aftershock earthquake 
hypothetical case go earthquake aftershock start march south hour pass monday tuesday 
one thing quite helpful california loma prieta earthquake give forecast aftershock probability large aftershock hour day main event 
probably mid afternoon monday seismologist would give advisory probabilities additional large aftershock 
then tuesday even magnitude kilometer west anchorage 
you hour recover first shock 
you still electric power 
most bridge 
the port devastate flame 
this sound like movie think realistic vulnerability face 
day main event aftershock impact anchorage lot structure severely damage first event 
this become important issue response mode main shock deal subsequent event 
for next several day continue experience aftershock begin recovery

disaster response disaster response santa cruz county follow the loma prieta earthquake gary smith assistant city manager city watsonville watsonville california fort bragg mendocino county north san francisco alaska earthquake 
get tidal wave earthquake 
attest damage even area 
indeed impressed ability alaska produce big earthquake 
for part today go give little bit background effect loma prieta earthquake watsonville 
you saw engineering geological perspective morning detailed reason building fail especially unreinforced masonry building 
go give little bit simplistic viewpoint reaction earthquake 
fact simple 
when hear rumble know mother nature turn man loose kick tail 
and first thought take cover survive 
because living lot little shaker healthy respect large earthquake 
and underneath table duck cover position hop pray guy design building attend morning class learn great deal design building survive 
see particular slide top building parapet first well overhang 
and lesson learn run inside building outside think go survive 
fact victim right street comer either push sidewalk actually run bakery street 
the debris top building parapet let loose come land upon child 
she fell child unfortunately become victim 
standpoint ofhazards watch really closely fall overhang 
talk content slide show content damage 
building content crash right wall street 
again want run outside building 
think thing 
take cover survive 
the first phase response emergency personnel people know really reinforce fact get survive quake 
you dam thing 
after many challenge ahead 
many natural gas leak five different fire 
small community like every fire engine city own night deal fire natural gas leak hazardous material problem 
here slide show good lesson regard hazardous material contain cylinder 
snot top want chain 
the bottom also need secure 
when thing fall head cylinder break release content especially lie ground come aerosol fashion much faster much deadly 
number cylinder chain high 
they chain low 
seismic safety important concern secure hazardous material 
cold storage facility lose evaporator allow pound ammonia release inside building 
fortunately able contain ammonia build slow fashion able ventilate control release 
but mitigation would strap evaporator would never come loose problem 
the earthquake case last second 
for response power electricity communication system knock 
from standpoint challenge go fire emergency medical rescue hazardous material 
four thing really much problem 
but way always go 
would like summarize first phase earthquake response 
way get inspired little bit remember talk want deal first hour follow earthquake 
some real lesson learn phase 
the first lesson already tell survive really anything capture composure 
get head 
get back ball game 
like knock good one 
you fall fanny 
but go get right back get organize get move effort 
check status position equipment personnel 
develop line communication know everybody back roll system respond emergency ready 
and lot able next phase know resource capability go deal next potential problem 
and real key subject establish priority emergency 
disaster plan address 
but find never near clear enough emergency responder people field 
our priority fire department control life threaten fire first 
because service go able deal potential problem 
and ifleft ofcontrol could take good portion community 
our second priority make sure emergency medical system place 
now people deal emergency medical problem 
and hop plan effort local medical clinic paramedic group hospital organize enough 
because real close come hazardous material release especially gas cloud develop 
you capability site certain amount management 
standpoint go community city particularly emergency service address life threaten problem involve hazardous material 
and lastly even though important come rescue 
our logic put rescue fourth priority generally speaking time organize address whereas fire hazardous material jump quickly may defensive mode loses good portion city 
thing mind first thing people engine company upon gain composure get organize get roll establish disaster response protocol 
case communication system strap nearly well enough lose communication 
the battery come connection generator 
and communication center equipment fall dispatcher abandon ship 
fact get go establish emergency operation center saw panicked communication coordinator fire department portable radio one hand police portable 
everybody still kind state shock 
gain composure get organize 
and actually set dispatch center parking lot work first half hour could get back get thing organize open next part operation regard phase 
you might see tape oakland bay bridge car travel along bridge earthquake 
the driver notice bridge completely fail 
the car drive open part bridge 
especially careful travel earthquake 
and fact california highway patrol officer respond call go ramp go airborne 
and light skid around steer around pier plunge pavement earthquake 
when get close see skid mark around pier 
and skidmarks place gentleman experience 
driver train never excite academy 
the concern case great deal natural gas community 
case lot natural gas leak 
some major street 
other low pressure system home 
learn fire department people minimal train great deal stop low pressure gas leak 
the redwood plug one valuable piece equipment time like 
redwood plug work 
think part train acknowledge help small leak turn professional utility worker loose deal big leak street obviously fire natural gas kind fuel like get along 
the sooner coordinate control kinds problem well 
lot communication system bit dust 
this amateur radio operator come back 
but plan 
case cellular phone work well 
and believe thought content damage facility thing fly 
underneath desk place protect go become victimize 
then try organize back work become difficult 
think early planning 
now let highlight real quick phase second half hour 
you know give minute get organize 
but ready work 
one thing never problem emergency response people want home check family 
but go air real early people station arrive within second half hour assure people field family look 
terrible feel work public know status family home especially devastate community look work 
go leave copy county earthquake emergency response plan fire chief anchorage fire department hopefully share anybody want 
write get copy 
put lot information lesson learn countywide respond emergency earthquake 
and family checkmatrix really work well 
establish emergency control command structure important 
the incident command system work 
believe work 
but take phasing operation 
right bat incident commander case community five different fire burn two station 
split five fire try keep take entire block rather house burn 
and actually engine officer become incident commander way 
they divide handle many major incident 
second half hour develop need delegate command really important regard people charge specific physical area 
important clear communication network 
communication field commander area commander locate emergency operation level 
the next level case county office emergency service 
really important keep communication next level level communicate statewide level 
you know convince well number people san francisco earthquake probably first day and outskirt 
little know middle 
fact right next epicenter 
and never know 
and mind thinking poor people bay area 
go stand 
and demand support minimal 
statewide system first think watsonville santa cruz must ask much 
well perception problem 
trained point think stand hour 
and try everything 
little know mile outside city watsonville everything 
saw something similar recent northern california earthquake around eureka area 
fortuna ferndale rio del get hit pretty hard 
but eureka come fine shape 
and eureka available support community 
but needed communicate need level could see big picture 
and big picture could return vision knew 
really miss boat area acknowledge early 
would also like coordinate windshield survey 
videotape leave show scene immediately follow earthquake 
guy vehicle start pan area camera 
hard survey fire see smoke columns come different part community 
and know area 
study geology real well know expect damage 
you know area landslide potential liquefaction potential old structure especially unreinforced masonry 
you look area first 
because guarantee major problem go 
and finish look rest community 
the sooner get do sooner ass go need support 
and second phase nice able develop communicate people help 
the state federal government county service ready help 
but need hear local people problem really 
the benefit planning prepared deal disaster able step 
and get emergency operation center open schedule first meeting 
case little differently people emergency operation center 
people gather one room command control disaster 
policy meeting lead people come one room talk go disaster next phase 
and back office actually carry plan 
think right take public work director water map sewer map data information office facility design stand heavy earthquake put room telephone little cubicle work 
want public work director room fire chief build official police chief everybody els policy group relay concern get back get organize set disaster response procedure motion actually address problem 
last phase slide 
this picture emergency operation policy room 
finish meeting 
put information disaster wall 
and meet come together spend minute talk happen hour go 
hour hour minute open emergency operation center 
you need schedule policy meeting basis group feel necessary 
right earthquake meeting every four hour 
but soon come twice day eventually day 
the emergency operation center stay available information people almost two half month 
finance director say important log information capture detail write number hour work kind information get response disaster valuable 
may seem valuable valuable try put piece together get fund back federal emergency management agency fema regard reimburse 
first write white board erase every time 
information write lose 
but use newsprint pad easel could capture lot real key information would need support 
the need good clean water obviously important follow earthquake 
because damage water system sewer system guarantee water quality 
bring water critical 
and hard 
get lot support outside community providing water 
inspection building lot people want start return building 
color cod inspection notice best 
green yellow good check inspector red enter 
the disaster response team need mean control traffic isolate deal people need keep post go 
the logistical need recovery real challenge disaster response 
the emergency tell truth easy 
emergency first four five six hour 
lot thing control 
recovery go month 
still go community 
and come prepared fire department police department really participate recovery process 
fact engine room one fire station 
become cafeteria people come help bring food 
and course expect 
you take care 
you fee 
and take care shelter personnel need prepared serve disaster role 
one big request must put half dozen time somebody come kitchen facility 
and funny four arrived time hot water one tell could back home 
but setup critical 
lot people valuable time like 
some people day day staff member become real hero disaster response 
they fire chief 
they police chief 
they people like secretary really buckled fashion really bring people back foot quickly 
tent shelter another whole subject 
resource like find pair size shoe person pile stuff 
but know come truckloads 
and everything 
organize become challenge 
now plan address kind need 
support system warehouse way inventory give resource 
and course demolition recovery 
charles eadie go talk city watsonville 
also incident commander city santa cruz 
you really good story recovery tomorrow charles 
put together community disaster plan charles go profile tomorrow 
the plan really bring people watsonville together around disaster response need base incident command system get back foot recovery phase 
last thing want quickly highlight last phase concern 
the first thing list initiate first eoc emergency operation center policy meeting 
lifeline issue 
you emergencies medical emergency well hazard fire 
you get control 
you start think shelter food plan inclement weather 
you need close work relationship red cross salvation army big player get care people 
the city responsibility 
go wrong tell news headline worldwide mistreat people community municipality anchorage public entity 
you good take part serious real challenging effort 
assign command function the big player right bat logistics people 
they one go get supply food everything els respond deal big need earthquake 
they go feed people 
they go care people 
they go get fork lift everything els 
the operation person charge overall operation make sure coordinating back 
operation also may take liaison officer type function 
other essential function feed care emergency worker organize support function course incident command position 
finance public information safety critical 
also plan section document situation status keep ongoing assessment damage problem community keep operational people focus real priority deliver service 
this page leave blank 
disaster preparedness the municipality anchorage larry langston anchorage fire department anchorage alaska year since anchorage major earthquake 
and lot time think would happen another one occur dimension 
look santa cruz problem similar would anchorage community across united state 
what like discuss anchorage fire department would try think far concern first three hour major earthquake 
bit laundry list 
but think something might able take home help understand would deal maybe take back community think aspect 
and try redundant chief already cover 
anchorage certainly time year quake would occur would important incident command point view handle operation 
one occur today november would significantly different occur june 
the time day course important 
how many people room like versus home residential area 
these important consideration 
the size quake determine everything 
use minor shaker 
there significant difference minor one one really damage city high degree 
could possibly lose high rise 
and could possibly even lose one four hospital area 
when quake initially hit know go take activate emergency operation center 
supervisor police department fire department go work autonomously 
they go work crew 
responsibility handle localize level get communication system run 
they go utilize resource maximum degree initial moment get people together start get thing control 
go ask certain key people report emergency operation center 
much like chief smith 
the utility go important 
law enforcement fire department utility important 
and go want get assistance get large equipment anchorage 
the way setup system fire chief designee assume operation command 
the chief police take law enforcement duty 
one first thing go want emergency operation center establish go want meet mayor city manager 
may telephone whatever make early policy decision be go allow 
property destroy order save life 
now may sound like difficult decision 
limited resource 
and may make decision go let significant property anchorage order minimize loss life 
and policy decision come mayor office designee 
normally fire chief operational commander take appropriate action mitigate harm citizen municipality go property well 
but successful fire department need four thing 
go need water supply 
go need significant number duty personnel 
go need necessary equipment good communication 
possible handle situation limit amount time without communication 
but need first three absolutely 
utilize incident command system 
anchorage respond alarm year 
approximately utilize call incident command system 
organize approach line authority take command situation know city size go activate mutual aid local police fire department 
and go divide city sector 
now activate mutual aid do lot preparation last several year put together mutual aid manual 
and update every year 
they cover resource available anchorage area what available far manpower equipment kulis air base chugiak fire department girdwood fire department matanuska susitna borough 
these book go resource try pull together 
another priority go establish radio frequency go use 
now go real problem 
move towards trunk radio common band communication 
time vhp uhf 
but interlink much 
the fire department go put trunk radio system year million 
the anchorage police department follow shortly thereafter 
and two military base already trunk radio 
eventually plan bring whole city area type frequency band talk 
talk fire chief around country earthquake become apparent another thing go want right away give local telephone need priority call come outside alaska 
go ask anchorage telephone utility maximize resource anchorage area community affect within alaska 
because happen earthquake take place relative friend country go try call 
and paralyze telephone communication system 
another thing right away ask safety check personnel fire station pull engine company medic unit heavy rescue unit ladder company fire station put safe area 
firehouse tendency collapse earthquake large span apparatus room 
san francisco engineering study do fire station 
and expect significant quake lose percent firehouse 
order minimize 
aftershock one first thing pull apparatus station respond need 
like chief smith show one thing go assure first responder personnel comfortable family safe 
know priority community go 
and set system 
after divide city sector go look try get air soon possible helicopter survey go 
send fire crew call first response area initially 
that ass immediate response area amount damage reporting 
but also go need get air see need concentrate effort 
mass casualty situation hope never happen anchorage activate mass casualty crew paramedic primary triage team anchorage 
they respond area high concentration loss life injury 
the plan anchorage stand right physician report hospital build collapse area sustain damage 
after set hospital radio network 
test every week 
and know ever work properly 
keep try 
the goal get hospital frequency time talk emergency operation center 
the purpose able tell field unit capability hospital transport victim 
take providence hospital example put three four major bum patient emergency room completely max facility 
need know type patient need able communicate hospital tell want bring see bed availability determine whether take patient load 
this worked drill certain degree 
but fairly untested anchorage drill 
also expect delay initially minute base community 
occurs try best get area crew must remember anchorage five paramedic unit 
again mutual aid important 
chief smith mention five fire go 
feel significant earthquake like expect fire anchorage quake 
and determine resource go use 
that initial decision go put resource important 
one major build collapse normally take resource fire department 
probably helicopter review set priority try put team get 
the thing know cony try get people large build collapse heavy equipment useful 
and really surprised 
everything do hand 
hand tool lot manpower need 
work public information office try public try get volunteer help 
the kind psas public service announcement try include ask volunteer report certain location 
also go want put announcement people use fireplace chimney check use elevator high rise back structure okd engineer send check structure damage 
fortunately anchorage excellent fire code 
and excellent building code number year 
chance massive damage fairly low 
the problem get actual building much think soil build 
and concern come 
for instance know quake occurs expect three time many fire building construct soft soil versus firm soil 
real problem look area build anchorage 
finally go real concerned rotate crew get food people incident debrief 
san francisco important get crew first response incident debriefing within first six hour amount psychological trauma go try get people cave in building collapse 
after three six hour depend size quake anchorage fire department probably turn command public work department emergency operation center 
take back seat support role 
comment audience stewart would like one question pose thought might interest number people 
the question incident command organization oem 
well oem office emergency management like say right quake 
due budget cut one administrative position 
and crisis action team actually call function incident commander 
and go beyond call whoever may appropriate person act incident commander 
and expand stay flexible 
from incident command organization perspective oem since one position deep function coordinator help incident commander keep everybody els tune theirjob keep everything flow 
might also mention community involvement standpoint probably unique organization anchorage area yet see low 
and call joint medical emergency preparedness group jmepg 
this fact plan group disaster plan group key mass casualty medical community 
large number participant 
all major hospital many download hospital also involve along key government agency 
and jmepg run large exercise year move volunteer victim 
and half year also table talk 
also initiatives anchorage chamber commerce petroleum industry red cross 
the red cross key player emergency operation center 
response the pajaro valley unified school district follow the loma prieta earthquake hank hendrickson pajaro valley unified school district watsonville california want give little history school district put perspective 
school district 
and cover area mile long 
go ocean top santa cruz mountain 
cover acres contains million square foot school facility 
like also talk little bit plan think important let know right wrong 
and believe thing wrong thing right 
you never find disaster 
involve emergency plan ever since come school district 
and real proud fact active area 
some thing involve purchasing water drum store water site gallon drum 
involve normal drill drop cover actually take bus go evacuation drill 
involve communication drill 
that mean every school district report superintendent office along support group transportation maintenance operation special service group site away school 
the thing involve outfit take care first aid kit 
probably important thing get involve make sure everyone staff custodians principal vice principal even secretary able shut school site 
able shut water gas electricity ensure fire 
this earthquake happen afternoon 
but custodial staff site 
and say right without question every site turn 
they train 
and important many many many gas leak 
and sure would fire 
another thing think important 
think school especially middle school high school chemistry lab really get take close look lab safety 
get look really go study saw go 
and segregation chemical separate caustic flammables type nature 
but know much 
start mix chemical real problem 
fact hear horror story chemical labs second floor mix actually eaten hole right next room far would 
problem damage building also real problem cleanup 
and involve cleanup chemical day age pretty expensive proposition 
result look carefully able circumvent serious problem chemical 
and work closely 
watsonville fire department 
tomorrow go get little bit nittygritty stuff 
and far go subject right 
but want say part effective 
second day people office state architect show 
they architect come see well school district building fare earthquake 
and quick one day one day back office get example happen building 
say proud state california architect 
go earthquake damage happen city watsonville honestly say one school building collapse 
not one school building burn 
one facility special education facility red tag condemn architect move 
one large facility square foot two story high school even though move back keep go back check finally come conclusion safe use 
and evacuate 
but happen april 
that quite job itselfjust get move building 
there classrooms second floor 
and entire administration high school serve student operate one building 
disaster try get people move get temporary facility 
but believe take place matter seven day 
also district architect call upon come help survey building 
and one problem building even though capable people go around check still teacher staff refuse unless saw structural engineer come actually say yes safe 
go route hire structural engineer facility check 
sure many people know dsr ever get involved earthquake know right quickly 
stand damage survey report 
and time happen never know one exist 
but later always remember first day tell secretary you good get real big binder 
sure fill binder get do 
well lined binder leave take picture 
there binder fill dsrs along support documentation 
and say need 
well without get pay 
you get document everything 
you get show proof happen 
and get permission repair 
and right estimate million worth damage believe probably miss worth 
now pretty good record figure deal try get money 
some major problem major obstacle overcome first electricity 
two six day 
and really bad 
open several school 
and mind take seven day night get school open 
and get open mean heat 
even california get cold night 
and get cold morning 
also telephone 
want back little bit brush 
talk thing important make emergency kit part emergency preparation 
and part kit emergency generator 
and thing thing important 
because first thing happen number one gas tank supply vehicle yard underground require pump pump gas 
well power go get gas 
first thing generator could hook get gas tank 
and naturally principal school board everybody els happen gas 
actually ration gasoline district staff 
the problem telephone system 
and power supply 
and back battery 
well battery last long especially emergency situation everybody uncle use 
within hour battery dead without generator would luck 
the thing spent lot money lot time buy radio equipment one every school site 
fact start equipment expensive 
and like every school district money buy one time 
take four five school per year buying radio set 
and go geographical area important 
those one supply first 
also repeater mount toro 
and next big mistake 
beautiful radio 
and set drill work beautiful 
ignore one thing 
and emergency power supply repeater mount toro 
the thing help gift cellular phone portable give electronics firm 
and kept business 
think problem next time get emergency generator power repeater mountain 
you kind picture area 
the mountain come almost ocean 
and lot ravine lot hill 
like area 
hill cause problem communication 
and require repeater top hill make system work 
the thing become problem broken glass 
find quickly glass available put back 
and also find another thing supply plywood evaporates quick 
probably kind best thing happen whole episode phone call receive company mount shasta california mile north 
firm make plywood 
and call one day say like help 
could use plywood 
and say boy could kiss 
they say would send 
and next day semi load plywood show 
and godsend 
much good semi load clothes dump parking lot 
the thing problem try get around school bridge go south out town close 
the main highway go south town one saw picture collapse 
trouble get get place check get go 
time local police department time want get school open want get kid street would get trouble 
and number two want place feed 
anxious see happen soon possible 
and think seven day fast certainly many case ready 
actually receive people earthquake 
deal kid 
and first week third along staff 
and take long time get build back 
finish year average daily attendance student 
many people actually leave town 
another thing do thought work well actually establish command post like fire department police department everybody els 
our superintendent set command post 
the entire school board principal support staff meet every day five clock 
discuss every school take get back operation 
make policy news release everything go press radio everything write 
because find anytime call talk get turn around 
make point make sure everything put write everybody get story correct accurate 
one problem never dream fact percent community hispanic 
and even though kitchen facility open red cross group get inside 
they use restroom facility 
they take athletic field high school middle school set tent city 
but yet toilet facility 
bring portable toilet 
they even cement block toilet facility athletic field 
away building 
safe get 
they still inside 
create quite problem 
another problem school city water system 
one large high school water system well 
two storage tank one gallon one gallon 
the small two tank tip inch dump water 
and also inch main go school rupture 
lose water supply 
the well become contaminated 
create problem try get one open 
here another firm water distribution company good brought gallon potable water gallon plastic container 
get pump go well 
and use toilet facility 
but able get awhile get well straighten get back operation 
one thing talk much today fear thing deal people 
and touch tomorrow 
but big thing 
difficult get crew back teacher people need 
work home burn home destroyed family injure 
many many case choice send home 
good send somebody fix something get scar building 
one thing mention far believe fact earthquake magnitude first day something like 
imagine building 
they empty inside crawl space inspecting 
you underneath attic check 
pretty hairy thing start shake 
become real problem 
policy employee felt get live home 
all come tell 
make sure everyone pay 
they tell first two week everybody receive paycheck whether 
that ease lot tension lot problem 
some principle type damage tower roof come ceiling classroom particularly drop ceiling acoustical ceiling come 
old school build five old lath plaster yet 
that plaster naturally come 
window come 
concrete explode 
sidewalk erupt naturally require lot cleanup lot barrier around 
there still evidence around town yet 
boiler heater one thing never count fire brick boiler 
they crumble sort fell 
and naturally get old boiler built year ago require special fire brick 
and take awhile get back line 
problem never anticipate never give think 
light fixture stage light fluorescent light you notice come sit people sit 
sat look like thing 
guarantee like 
one high school come 
and know grateful kid could serious injury 
the thing suspend heater really check 
there real problem 
and naturally stack smokestack thing come 
problem asbestos 
fiber release 
asbestos cleanup do 
chimney brick chimney crack remove 
naturally office equipment computer typewriter vcrs audio visual equipment go fly 
program set try attempt fasten thing 
but succeed 
awful lot stuff damage 
involve shortly lot regulatory agency federal emergency management agency fema california office emergency service oes united state 
department education 
they get rule like believe 
for example fema deal facility nothing kid administration building transportation maintenance special education administrative facility 
but get problem joint use 
for example watsonville high school swim pool also city watsonville swim pool 
fema say student 
and touch 
and oes come along say go touch 
the public us summertime 
and get two agency together determine go pay get fix 
what happen pip go around pool fill drain rupture 
involve cut concrete get pipe repair 
there big argument underground work 
gas line would fee administration build school 
who go pay 
well sit argue 
and leave without say responsible 
fact let know little bit 
the first seven inspector show fema one female school 
and gentleman retire caltrans engineer 
and start job 
and immediately see eye eye 
and say yes say 
sudden end get damage survey report say sign say agree disagree approve approve 
say yes say 
and say yes say 
how resolve thing 
naturally couple week get mad leave 
next inspector come 
and start 
go nine set inspector fema 
believe persevere get 
but get enough take care problem 
naturally people divide stuff 
for example fema pay percent oes pay percent 
then get united state department education pay percent oes pay percent 
get percentage play game 
some problem run bring structural engineer check building 
and structural engineer find problem say five building 
the office emergency service fema say pay structural engineer place find damage 
and rest pay 
you stick 
the thing way asbestos 
you know get asbestos school need inspect whole thing need qualify person story 
yes find problem pay 
but pay rest inspection 
kind hidden cost 
the way administrative cost 
some pay 
for example fema would pay think get fema get oes 
and united state department education pay anything 
disaster preparedness the anchorage school district tombibeau anchorage school district anchorage alaska think know event talk occurs clock monday morning december outside community go severely impact 
and go need help get cooperation get get event 
when start talk disaster preparedness district first come statement want 
say first want make sure maintain operation school kid reunite parent quickly possible 
try maintain school day 
student cannot stay school elementary school alternate site principal pick central administration know 
alternate site work go take central site 
the central site probably secondary school 
let look event central administration standpoint 
the event occur superintendent set emergency communication center administration building still operational one secondary school 
wrd965 megahertz emergency broadcasting system 
there two way radio secondary school couple elementary school blanket bowl area 
unfortunately elementary school rest one way 
they send runner secondary school near two way communication location 
what superintendent would cabinet emergency communication team would establish need 
where major damage resource need 
also go chair office emergency management emergency operation center bob stewart next red cross coordinate resource 
the resource obviously include facility plan 
facility plan district four architect four engineer 
these people start south end town work towards north end town survey initially building determine whether habitable 
this real quick check write 
let emergency communication center know habitable 
light need 
the resource people transportation student nutrition maintenance operation 
let look event perspective school 
the event occur elementary kid practice duck cover drill duck cover hold 
they may evacuate 
they may evacuate 
that would build decision make depend upon condition building right event 
they initiate school emergency disaster plan disaster team sweep building check condition kid thing like 
there could two scenario one significant damage may alternate site minor damage could stay build 
could nonstructural damage could stay build 
they could dismiss old kid elementary kid secondary kid depend upon neighborhood like could dismiss 
the elementary principal know go charge elementary kid turn parent authorize adult 
the central site need central site let say kid reunite parent end day kid would take central site could high school 
these thing ask school think disaster planning 
emergency operation plan model plan school outline thing consider thing need talk 
ask hazard hunt 
and nonstructural hazard 
think move heavy thing low shelf thing like 
make sure shelve attached wall 
ask duck cover hold drill elementary kid 
that require monthly 
secondary kid part curriculum practice 
do occasion practice regularly like elementary school 
elementary school mandatory 
ask principal parent teacher association promote home planning make sure parent ready make sure alternate number emergency number friend authorized pick kid 
and try get everybody train first aid 
want show thing happen resource available occurs day 
this example thing happen one school 
this chugach optional 
they sophisticate kit 
but two basically cardboard box end building 
and include thing like cotton glove dust mask student record safety plan first aid equipment thing like 
northwood elementary sort test site 
mike webb work susan usher principal try thing 
these kid duck cover drill northwood elementary 
again duck cover drill mandatory elementary school 
they monthly 
these kid classroom 
good shot duck cover hold 
these kid could get matter second 
really surprised 
these hold device try northwood make heavy duty velcro 
they sort pricey think go work 
that keyboard 
that monitor 
tough get monitor move thing place 
and barely move 
difficult tip 
this piano music room 
the principal want move around earth move 
chain floor 
thought good idea 
school get emergency kit sophisticate other 
these commercially available 
and kind pricey 
for fourmember emergency team include tool hard hat glove safety glass flashlight rope tool plastic sheeting tape first aid 
and grab run 
again kind pricey 
they wheel 
term facility transportation department tudor road 
there hundred bus 
bus would good transportation could emergency shelter could heat 
they make great ambulance get gumeys 
obviously depend upon condition road 
but would great resource 
conner director maintenance 
maintenance would great resource 
lot talented people lot mobile equipment get school back line 
shop wood shops auto shop 
food service could stand alone 
dennis barrett director could put meal day probably two week 
this warehouse locate debarr 
generator run everything 
the side gas fire equipment 
lose gas go eat cold cut sandwich awhile 
there lot stuff would available emergency 
that assembly line fortrayed meal one walk cooler big cauldron 
event occur degree zero community go impacted 
planning go 
there lot thing available 
more always do 
this page leave blank 
volunteer resource for disaster response san lorenzo valley california mary hammer valley resource center ben lomond california much fun back alaska 
the last time earthquake 
and seem possible year ago 
obviously lot different thing right 
live community hank describing mountain 
say large city tree 
there actually resident two valley city santa cruz metropolitan area san jose 
believe percent resident commute 
think relation live area six federally declare disaster last year 
two year landslides people kill heavy heavy rain inch hour 
all arterials close 
people catch santa clara san jose area 
they get home 
they idea child 
the problem sure problem people move urbanized area think gosh go great get traffic 
and go live beautiful community tree smell clean air 
they forget power quite often 
they get home road close 
and subject different disaster hit 
landslide storm 
lexington fire 
another landslide storm era valentine day 
then earthquake course 
and end two year ago major freeze cause million dollar watsonville santa cruz area 
the thing locust pestilence 
hopefully go get 
population consist commuter 
realize small group people realize early resident disaster relief organization resident least bit prepared self sufficient 
and form organization call valley emergency preparedness project 
the major goal enable community surround community independent possibly could become aware red cross go doorstep soon something happens like see television canteen 
the fire department go able get right away 
and imperative first people scene know family neighbor course important 
what develop simple process whereby map area topographically form sector whereby people could walk without cross stream know landslide area 
within sector develop neighborhood area neighborhood coordinate area 
neighborhood coordinator take care home 
any much 
that neighborhood coordinator use card show overhead discover vulnerable population exist also resource skill equipment exist within neighborhood 
share vulnerable population anyone 
think first would good get list handicap elderly latchkey kid fire department 
well live small community fire department pretty much know vulnerable population 
and want list float around someone could pick wonderful list illegal type activity 
once neighborhood coordinator gather information resource skills send sector leader 
and sector leader one person receive information topographically accessible sector 
one person know sheriff deputy live anybody type first aid training nurse live 
all people use resource small community 
within area come grant bay area regional earthquake preparedness project federal emergency management agency fema able organize amateur radio operator 
and kind uncommon situation discipline work together 
case work well 
radio operator identify one sector 
for area square mile sector cover radio operator 
the radio operator sector leader know life 
and know get touch 
give simple way get information impact area 
santa cruz communication system basement nonreinforced concrete structure sit flood plain san lorenzo river 
quickly decide need alternate communication local fire station two amateur two radio set 
close contact county communication 
but least way get information responder hand immediately 
because message get local fire department treat call sent fire department wherever message need get help particular area 
the office emergency service local county emergency service office 
either get message area phone phone work radio tell situation occur 
one major problem area get inch rain hour 
mean need alert people know landslide area key thing may start come hillside 
also phone tree phone work quickly get message neighborhood coordinator 
go sector leader neighborhood coordinator neighborhood 
good example one thing happen freeze radio tell people medium need drip faucet would 
allow pipe freeze 
well people felt drip good letting run full go really good really protect 
well happen area run water 
immediately get information people stop drip 
and work 
save water 
the reason start place prior earthquake 
imagine hot 
really hot 
and everybody sit outside world series begin 
walk house earthquake hit 
take one look kitchen floor everything go think want 
knew family 
much rather help 
get local fire department 
and go set shelter 
there approximately fire department vehicle wait major fire 
don forget drought 
drought three year 
but three year 
really concern go get major conflagration hop happen 
also know major storm come go carry famous inch rain 
and also sure go another major shock 
stand front fire department know moment could another major disaster 
however start tell system place 
and take minute amateur radio radio operator get operate 
and able get communication among active 
the phone someone say damage system inundated people call area 
use radio operator extensively 
what find short term response absolutely excellent 
able get volunteer immediately able get food cook begin identify need 
able determine collection distribution sit food water clothing medical supply minor medical need 
the local community base organization like church able give pretty good short term response 
the red cross come shelter set first even 
begin assist coordinate community base organization help federal state agency determine go locate 
and really push get fema disaster assistance center dacs area 
something remember want disaster assistance center centrally locate seem make sense look outside problem 
but really want get many small disaster assistance center locate impact community many representative agency evaluate situation like small business administration red cross fema legal assistance filling form senior citizen networks different people need disaster assistance center people number different place 
and locate community 
there also child care available people stress kid 
and really disturbing situation especially tell might able get help whatever reason 
develop communication network ahead time agency extremely important 
and develop system update information referral information victim volunteer 
absolutely incredible telephone number change telephone get go 
and people move office 
must get information people get help soon possibly 
and really best do small community level 
what go right 
again short term immediate response wonderful 
immediate activation amateur radio net immediate response american red cross church 
realize quickly need debriefing 
someone els mention think mike smith need psychological debriefing 
tend think victim need 
that true 
anybody work within disaster conflict within worker also within try job stress 
what go wrong 
these thing even look back hard figure 
almost impossible identify need either short term long term go community 
knew need water 
knew chimney 
debris removal big one 
but try get information resident far need everybody shock 
and really come grip want somebody 
consequently volunteer everywhere think 
biola college los angel 
volunteer colorado everywhere think 
and really know send tell 
group four wheel drive people come central valley 
and beautifully fix four wheel drive little trailer 
they want know 
and get map send map isolate area talk people really interview people get indication need 
they come back within four hour say hey look 
really appreciate do try organize 
but halloween 
come halloween 
go home kid 
and go home watch soccer game 
because see community ask identify talk people really interested 
they want play soccer carve pumpkin 
and go 
what people think really try psychologically get kind normalcy life 
and probably month later really begin get indication go 
wonderful volunteer know send 
and need begin identified month two month later fact still get people come discover damage 
all volunteer go 
they go home 
somehow get get handle good way identify need 
and think best way experience determine mind need go 
and say hey feel 
debris removal start channel water need different thing 
another problem duplication effort community base organization respond agency 
really predetermine assigned responsibility say like pta go something church go take feeding salvation army handle clothes 
best get organization normally work particular issue 
like food pantry deal food 
salvation army deal clothes 
that best way handle 
but really need predetermine responsibility one local community base organization begin get people step toe 
and create problem take long time ease 
predetermine clear listing immediate need kind amount clothing food camp supply 
sanitary supply big one diaper tampon sanitary napkin 
those thing really need 
once think hank mention inundated clothes 
fact van clothes would make circle santa cruz mountains northern end 
well tell well watsonville need clothes 
and keep go round round polyester clothes 
earthquake least home need clothes 
mean could get house get thing 
alaska may different story 
but would able specifically say need polyester need whatever 
and list predetermine think go need 
need adequate community education disaster victim reasonably expect respond public private agency 
people incredibly inflate idea community base organization respond agency go able supply 
hard able say go able expect 
people still wonder red cross handle long term need 
that job 
their job take care short term immediate need charitable organization come long term need government help 
get message prior disaster extremely important 
again able assign volunteer need 
kind go thing happen 
but recovery process find federal state agency come 
and call boilerplate scenario 
they would tell need 
and would tell guideline criterion get need meet 
they may may anything real community need 
good example fema allocate amount money would rebuild top maximum square footage reconstruction square foot 
bay area cannot get construction do less may even high 
they absolutely could believe cost inflate able get money community 
the thing continue inconsistency criterion guideline relief 
the rule keep change 
when deal people 
stress anyway tell get paperwork guideline meet able get whatever relief promise 
because week week rule change 
and make difficult 
there organization sponsor red cross united way evaluation response earthquake great east bay 
one major concern come government help agency like red cross would come 
they would bring people wherever people come 
there national people 
and would push local people local red cross local community base organization say hey know best 
go hurricane hugo 
go galveston 
do thing 
know need 
community need protect good organization developed say well mean people come please want listen know need 
and help 
and effective 
think fema begin get message effective 
and way handled situation cause lot frustration bring lot hurt 
what hop least hop do australia follow bush fire 
and know aware organization start australia call church unite 
they able build idea talk community know go community 
they set area coordinating council make local community base organization local government local large scale charity 
those people responsible identify need actual contact neighbor people church school 
the parent come school wonderful way collect information 
identify need 
then organize council set priority 
and federal state agency supply fund meet need determined local community 
and work 
note go turn woman red cross 
and say take control community 
know hazard 
and get right begin work get need meet 
disaster response the southcentral alaska chapter the american red cross sue lamunyon american red cross anchorage alaska agree lot mary say volunteer organization come help 
the red cross undergo lot growth 
they undergo lot change 
people watch newspaper know 
since elizabeth dole come board busy board governor 
and revamp red cross 
they look put responsibility preparedness plan right onto local chapter 
and affect chapter greatly anchorage 
use call operational headquarters 
one burlingame california midwest eastern operation headquarters 
they anymore 
there go regional office set kind year ago 
regional center set 
but bulk work come chapter 
take responsibility happens 
agree mary say talk national red cross 
and year ago would 
they take 
and push chapter 
and dangerous 
trained volunteer disaster earthquake whatever may 
remember october floods national red cross come 
side side effort would allow push back little comer job day day 
train folk see familiar face 
and important thing 
least training red cross office want see neighbor shelter work shelter 
want see strange face 
they go understand go 
our concern emergency food clothing shelter 
and go meet need 
but trained volunteer key 
process extensive training alyeska pipeline right 
do two session last month 
trained people 
go training first year valdez 
their folk agree come board work red cross side side respond 
they go take care family let folk know slope happen 
because imagine go pretty frightening people slope know happened family disaster strike 
damage assessment training get alyeska folk field 
and turn go damage assessment 
joint effort 
when october flood phenomenal 
volunteer come woodwork 
folk want give plane 
they want charter flight get people matanuska susitna valley get people seward kenai send wherever want 
and hundred 
and know earthquake get thousand 
depends upon need 
again delay get train folk 
put everything screech halt five day get folks get functional 
you coordinate volunteer church group salvation army 
because tell right salvation army 
they field 
they mobile feed site 
capability time 
work shelter family 
they work field 
good relationship 
there competition lot place 
try work closely churches school city 
joint effort 
team concept 
and really glad 
look back thing go homestead air force base hurricane andrew kind scary 
watch news alaska family homestead 
they equip deal thing equip deal 
people camper style 
they get rv get camper get tent sleep bag 
lot folk homestead 
and something big happens know deal 
knew red cross go homestead right away 
there way 
those people homestead give opportunity evacuate 
they choose 
and say shoe stay behind 
they evacuate 
they trouble loot 
that city problem city need take look 
but course stay behind prepare go face 
and face total devastation 
then come nobody help 
and mean nobody 
and kind band together broke school get start 
but frighten 
good anchorage first get 
there real apathetic attitude get 
go happen 
go happen 
and go happen 
matter go happen 
last couple year change 
the attitude change 
disaster around people take notice happen 
they take extra eight hour 
they take time meet supervisor coordinators business say yes go happen 
and need something 
participation class participation community event see increase 
and glad see 
because red cross 
mandate congress 
but one organization 
and state alaska exactly two pay disaster staff 
the rest volunteer 
red cross volunteer sit audience take time train 
they act behalf 
but also act behalf 
spent time salvation army year 
they get good group people 
they active training coordinating 
they recently reinstate voad group voluntary organization active disaster 
and glad see run 
they pull boy scout girl scout ham radio operator red cross salvation army volunteer church organization together everybody know go 
when shaker iii earthquake response exercise recently find lot people thing nobody know get do 
train practice train practice 
and hopefully disaster strike able provide service need provide community 
but joint effort 
question comment audience combellick rod combellick alaska geological survey 
compare two community one striking difference see response effort weather 
saw picture tent community watsonville 
understand listen hank lot case choice people want building 
the possibility disaster anchorage december january temperature raise 
seem like would create serious problem shelter people whose home actually damage earthquake people without electricity gas even without damage survival situation short period time 
fairbanks could january 
and become serious fast 
somebody say tell people use fireplace check chimney safe 
alternate source heat 
what alaska situation like 
lamunyon january february freeze and cold like 
and end opening shelter could get heat generate 
people alaska shelter orient 
they like shelter 
good turnout 
but choose stay home stay put 
and people use fireplace 
but cold situation 
earthquake situation 
would imagine thing bob do fire department work real close together something like happens make sure wherever 
and people go bundle come stay together 
self survival issue 
know bob something els want add city maybe 
but work real close together try come plan take care folk 
smith also add perspective nobody like live shelter 
shelter life enjoyable way life 
you place situation family thrown together one big group 
and even though manage properly health food everything do appropriately good living 
reason people go come shelter choice 
and situation lot home badly damage around liquefaction area 
there low income housing 
and percent people live area hispanic 
and choice limit 
most people want stay close home anyway make sure secure get back foot 
time choice 
now tent encampment set way saw 
and fact effort earthquake get new policy 
red cross never past even accept tent encampment acceptable standard shelter 
change policy progress establish tent shelter 
tent make heat 
fact sit next gentleman corp engineer army tent get national guard 
and heater put 
they use inclement weather use quick way establish shelter choice 
obviously country wintertime would last choice 
but one would leave disaster plan potentially may need nothing els 
watt ron watt municipality anchorage building department 
let make comment majority people room local organization would concern really prepared personally mean home 
take estimate would say probably percent residence anchorage would come fairly major earthquake reasonably good shape 
you probably may electricity likely 
you may may gas 
think probability gas well electricity 
but bad case scenario situation type event occur wintertime speaking probably one best thing person could would capacity generate electricity 
because prepared personally go really bad shape come attempt provide service public 
think every individual particularly homeowner really look self sufficient 
and course one thing would naturally capacity generate 
generate power run heating system assume get natural gas 
and even electricity use maintain life support system maintain structure 
another problem would residences heat cold go take long pipe freeze 
capacity either blow remove water pipe within structure go real damage problem 
hudson yes ken hudson matanuska susitna borough 
and brings point try prepared explain wife preparedness plan 
she point preparedness plan leave state immediately wait call tell everything fine come back 
and component evacuation case cold weather scenario may something look option get many people get warm climate 
have look kind component anything like 
stewart bob stewart municipality anchorage 
look evacuate people warmer climate earthquake 
one thing look many potential shelter get electricity back may may provide heat 
learn lesson result fairly substantial power outage anchorage area 
learn get right away check 
you need electricity 
you need heat 
they may synonymous 
you need people man shelter 
the thing learn people anchorage area resourceful probably resourceful thought 
past open shelter people come 
know mat anchorage get together open shelter large number home power outage christmas 
during time one family show shelter 
could figure rest 
start dig find many people outlying area power outage locate fact take portable generator go one house another 
they share neighbor 
they develop informal network 
everybody electric generator fact run many hour one house switch another 
and able keep electricity service water run heat livable level home one generator share 
now one thing learn 
recognize anchorage area could subject severe weather condition 
there thing keep hip pocket aircraft crash thing may relate power outage low temperature 
real pinch transit people mover pull distribute certain area 
bus school district 
those type thing go draw 
recognize disaster weather significant factor also tell channel provide resource certain area normally would provide resource 
weather become agree significant factor 
but weather one thing plan 
weather one thing determine priority effort scarce resource allocate 
webb the one factor become highly dependent upon natural gas within anchorage bowl since earthquake 
reliable source 
but totally reliable 
and put entirely much emphasis reliability resource 
alternative fuel source earthquake like fairbanks right independent oil resource use heat fuel 
yes natural gas 
yes likely survive 
but chance interruption 
and go severe problem go deal time 
long term recovery the loma prieta earthquake recovery saga charles eadie emergency coordinator city watsonville watsonville california randy updike talk yesterday make think downgrade status happy happy maybe 
there lots thing worry 
and every time earthquake discussion know always come rush back tension stress different thing deal 
when disaster 
you get plan happens big anything imagine 
and go emergency response way recovery 
today also go speak afternoon go modify go little bit 
instead focus much long term recovery morning afternoon 
this morning want talk transition emergency response short term recovery long term recovery 
think look back seem orderly 
first emergency response short term recovery long term recovery 
but fact tumble together 
and time never quite sure whether emergency response long term recovery 
and important lesson learn 
they try meet need community try adjust organization gear meet need ultimately lead long term recovery 
conclude today little discussion community base disaster response plan watsonville do think real good model 
the first thing deal emergency response really two phase go 
one call rescue phase 
that emergency people drill trained 
they know hazard go sort thing 
and really understand go advance 
little easy deal one guide value 
that guide value life safety 
but away get emergency get something complex 
you begin compromise balance life safety value thing 
and call post rescue phase 
both santa cruz watsonville make lot mid course adjustment postrescue phase thing happen anticipate 
and real challenge organization adapt respond go 
the second point success post rescue phase highly dependent recognize limit 
think tendency local government disaster emergency response want 
but matter fact really manage go spend lot time try link resource within community outside community 
then regard recovery planning probably fundamental fact community change forever 
little say california shift happens 
and shift happens put humpty dumpty back together 
this make long term recovery tremendous challenge political equilibrium upset economic equation change people take new role 
get kind complicate 
later afternoon 
this computer generate model 
what want illustrate slide leave measure say energy level level activity 
and time 
the first little bubble call rescue phase 
the second bubble post rescue phase 
the long dotted line keep go long term recovery 
think key point three start time 
and time emphasis shift 
maybe first hour maybe first hour maybe first week emergency personnel go run show 
that rescue phase 
and train well 
then gradually phase pas baton big hump middle post rescue phase 
and get little bit creative suddenly whole host decision make think go make enough information make forward little 
the long term recovery take place start 
even decision happen emergency phase go affect long term recovery 
overlap go 
think success rescue post rescue phase set stage well recover long term 
now yesterday talk little bit go right go wrong learn 
kind live guinea pig think example unexpected thing happen 
role emergency response plan santa cruz prior earthquake 
city planner general plan thing 
and week later appoint incident commander 
and know never quite figure happen keep try 
and get chart thing 
something must happen 
and basically happen far tell organization right thing awhile thing need do shift dramatically 
tell little story illustrate 
what happen santa cruz downtown area sustain damage nine square block downtown 
from life safety point view first thing cordon area incredibly dangerous 
within half hour hour police fire personnel block street 
and everybody gotten 
that well good awhile 
but day day day day business community start say well fine evacuate area tuesday 
earthquake hit get get back 
get business put back together 
think turn point come friday 
president bush visit santa cruz 
this area limit everyone part suddenly safe enough president 
you president walk street secret serviceman building 
saturday morning business people little bit upset 
they ask fundamental question unsafe come president 
they point 
go city hall saturday meeting go 
you get 
people courtyard listen loudspeaker hanging window 
look window 
there merchant merchant pound podium say look get get business go 
get get area

and camera city manager sweat drip face public work director 
and nod head 
these people really upset 
they say well plan monday go deal 
there business displace employee lot people 
well make long story short whatever reason monday really plan work everyone satisfaction 
and meet monday afternoon downtown association 
and meet get call public work director say charlie kind like liaison fire department downtown association see thing 
and saturday look think wonder go plan 
glad go 
you understand little something santa cruz 
the downtown one area like get absolutely bad place 
tsunami inundation area liquefaction area 
flood plain get 
emergency center establish mile away east side town 
and hoc emergency operation center 
then city hall downtown 
then central business district near city hall thing call pacific operation basically gatekeeping operation cordon area 
well week go city manager back city hall try deal property owner 
because fema say look guy get day get demolition go els go fund 
and want get permission property owner 
and city engineer try evaluate building come 
take place city hall 
meanwhile east side emergency center operate command post 
then pacific operation downtown control access 
the first thing hook president vice president downtown association 
go pacific operation downtown 
and fire guy 
say look get hold demolition 
plan figure get merchant get merchandise figure demolition come first 
they bulldozer demolition truck ready thursday morning 
and tuesday 
and say get move thing back 
you get put demolition back 
and say well say 
and talk city manager explain deal 
and say put demolition saturday 
go back pacific operation say demolition saturday 
and say 
well city manager 
they write 
then meet business leader 
and basically tell two thing one afraid city go like coalinga cordon area bulldoze whole nine block end 
they say happen business 
and say well go happen 
the second thing say you get something quickly try keep handle rank file 
the native get restless 
say put demolition 
take care 
and start set planning process 
then go back pacific operation fire department move demolition back saturday thursday 
knew work well 
the president downtown association little less subtle 
smoke come ear 
and say well hell say 
and say well incident commander 
well hell incident commander 
well incident commander base side town making decision 
and guy take order 
communication problem go city hall operation center downtown 
the long short spent lot time try figure 
and time explain city manager evening say well incident commander 
that introduction emergency management 
knew commander cody 
but know anything incident commander take job 
kid call infinite commander kind like 
but basically happen organization go fundamental shift move rescue phase post rescue phase 
really anticipate 
and adapt new circumstance shift priority basically change organization 
and end set entire organization pacific operation 
really lesson think right thing recognize maybe wrong thing 
and know advance quite right wrong 
but read react change adapt act knowledge limit info 
and real important thing 
think yogi berra say best 
say when come fork road take 
before flood rain 
with hurricane get warn 
you get little chance gear thing 
but earthquake go get whatever right 
you sit nice meal real cozy little restaurant next thing know get plaster fall gazpacho 
change outlook 
and damage variable 
place less place 
building deceive 
they might look good point view 
then take little step back see half wall fell 
and wild ride 
there many near miss almost frighten think 
but rescue phase fire people one really put line community 
that wall fell kill three people 
and guys work overnight light aftershock take place try dig rubble 
and medium event 
during rescue phase find lot time people already dead 
and real psychological trauma risk life knowing pressure know people probably already dead anyway 
fire respond 
sometimes get right away 
housing look like 
you see picture 
people evacuate set wherever 
another category adapt 
set emergency shelter civic auditorium find roof leaking move 
long line people start show food park watsonville 
eventually get around get fema trailer watsonville 
and take 
but rescue phase pretty basic 
the post rescue phase get complicate 
you get security issue 
merchant expose 
and figure go deal protect merchandise 
you cordon area 
you need short term patrol 
and move permanent deal fence 
then find well portable fence go move fence around time 
people respond incredibly term respect situation 
there expose building 
and people parade around downtown day earthquake 
and nothing stolen loot 
course german shepherd help present 
know balance good thing helpful reminder 
the medium something go deal major way 
they tendency say thing extreme downtown ruin 
the public information office go much effort expend deal medium 
but communication problem issue enormous 
you go deal get information client group people business resident 
and something really need pay attention 
and need lot resource devote 
because probably big problem work communication 
then course handle vip president congressman vicepresident wife people like george mader researcher show 
and important nice people never know recommend grant 
brought army corp engineer look levee figure right away might money 
get three former mayor escort 
then guy sign shop make plaque 
and give award couple general 
and next thing know get levee repair 
kind thing keep mind worth invest little bit public relation 
but take lot administration pull 
and merchant course want get back 
and say safe 
these building evaluate 
and red tag but lot question mark 
this building one erratic shear pattern 
and elevator shaft hold top part eight story building 
and actually snap 
thick elevator shaft thick snap torsion 
end create flight path around build four month rehabilitate keep people away ready fall 
you get one building threaten another 
somebody want get building fine 
but build next door ready topple allow access either building 
and big problem earthquake away 
you never quite sure whether finish whether get well get bad 
aftershock loma prieta earthquake 
and third one pretty jumpy 
remember go meeting truck would drive people would jump table 
these aftershock create administrative challenge get back keep reevaluating situation building condition 
like flood recedes leave mud 
with earthquake wonder prelude 
do big one 
prelude aftershock 
and geologist help 
they predict within year due earthquake 
make decision educate guess 
you plan calendar around geologic time 
you make decision base limited information 
try convey red tag yellow tag green tag building map 
and know take lots people stuff 
hank mention plywood yesterday 
board window check building every day set whole apparatus administer access area 
get hard hat 
the city attorney say look let anybody 
somebody go get hurt 
but mayor everybody say yeah well good 
but know let people go get reelect 
take risk try make thing safe 
and give everybody hard hat give identification fire escort 
the logistics enormous 
keep order hard hat hewlett packard 
and say want 
and say yeah 
end work incident command system try adjust 
think key downtown association 
all position invent one time another filled volunteer city personnel right away 
adversarial relationship potentially develop diffuse virtue participation work merchant 
spent incredible amount time planning go 
and use ask work client group directly organize access call cattle drive go building 
and margaret wilson one merchant explain program 
and tell important sort blur line little bit government client group 
because together 
and share information 
try hold thing back 
because people suspicious 
and suspicious go adversarial relationship 
hand involve completely try ready help 
and run people building 
even like think 
that one building saw demolish 
yet historic preservation people invite come 
and say hey building demolish building 
this building fine 
simple tie anchorjob 
and say well think 
people go get merchandise record 
then go demolish building 
the claw go touched building whole thing collapse 
maybe good 
but think pretty lucky 
branch rickey say luck residue design 
and know like think little bit design 
know lot luck 
but take risk 
then special circumstance like building tunnel building 
and volunteer come weekend help bookstore owner get book 
set resident put number people back keep track escorting 
guy want bring crane get coffee roaster building demolish 
well like first priority get around 
then course demolition 
you see thing earthquake half job 
prepare demolition get check asbestos let rip 
then get problem like rubble 
get five year worth landfill quake 
and get information like know building basement 
that important 
and reason important bulldozer guy drive around 
identify basement one time missed couple tear build next thing know drop floor 
but little shook 
try respond special request 
historic preservation people want save artifact nice old building lose 
people want get merchandise demolish 
the lawyer really like get record 
and say well never mind 
good time clean house 
then task shift get pavilion 
have place merchant 
and pass baton 
the earthquake happen october 17th thanksgiving get business district functioning 
and place people 
and another hookup community city partnership chamber commerce cultural council downtown association put together pavilion complete demolition get place people 
watsonville go trailer 
but conclude 
give talk say look know one thing get figure work community disaster big government handle 
when get watsonville community base disaster plan 
they go category thing go happen 
and work every organization community food bank red cross church 
all people involve emergency response follow earthquake 
the coordination enormous effort 
now plan city watsonville memoranda understanding various community organization go report relationship 
and fantastic document 
and highly recommend model 
would say think santa cruz watsonville fairly inventive 
get lot thing could do little easier advanced planning help anticipate unexpected event arose post rescue phase 
public work aspect long term recovery alaska kencanfield public work department municipality anchorage this really grand experience folk anchorage able sit hear talk start think want change way intend operate get another great earthquake 
and take hat folk organize 
certainly worthwhile 
heard throughout conversation talk discussion next one tough quake 
frontier town people close knit 
the next one people lot structure could challenge 
and think 
but really optimistic go handle 
think big communication counterpart throughout municipality hinder way 
during earthquake maintenance repair officer facility elmendorf air force base 
and let tell way survive get back foot total open cooperation agency 
particular case facility repair thing like transformer certain voltage water clamp water main 
water main break 
line fuse primary distribution system would kill could get hand 
need heavy equipment particularly tractor hydraulic ripper rare day cut frozen ground repair water break 
but tough 
however work city open warehouse 
and open warehouse 
and something immediate need get reverse 
and mayor sharrock never opportunity sir meet 
and year late 
but really appreciate help back 
our plan well nice red folder 
good shaker able grab hurry 
nice visible red folder lose dust collection shelf 
publish ink dry already make revision 
and continue 
because think operation plan publish sit 
you constantly bring state art 
give feel plan organize several annex different type disaster 
annex earthquake 
series appendix cover different functional area 
and talk public work obviously 
warn communication obviously important thing keep folk aware go 
requirement medium center 
that right next hoc emergency operation center 
get open bay fire department open bay drafty area place sit 
go make decent place keep folk control 
18th august year earthquake volcano across cook inlet start kick nasty stuff 
and get opportunity test 
and mayor staff one guy get carry one thing cellular phone around 
and absolutely useless phone system tie 
need get quickly trunk system chief mention 
and way could really communicate 
and know get problem work 
course law enforcement fire service folk know theirjobs well 
health human service prepare take care community health need 
inoculation program food service shelter kinds thing 
public work classical public work department anchorage alaska 
road drainage construction maintenance repair really half state rest 
and really sum total along building department 
however earthquake scenario come public work umbrella lot department property facility management 
cultural recreation service transit port merrill field 
many thing come public work umbrella earthquake functional control well use people 
and last least utility 
they major part activity recovery 
and talk dead winter earthquake zero would zero fairbanks 
could tough situation lose gas electric 
and guarantee resource probably devote get utility back line 
clear road would travel surface 
but would certainly work utility get back line 
that obviously lifeline support 
now individual department also plan talk thing like family care report kind thing 
get classic incident command structure disaster response activity 
this kind standard book solution familiar many famous emergency management institute 
they school maryland 
send many people thanks mike webb other help get public sector private sector school 
this solution pretty much disaster response organization 
the mayor would top block 
the incident manager commander however want call would initially fire chief probably city manager 
and cease fun probably public work director 
and operation really eoc 
best one world 
but satisfactory 
sit crest one hill underlain call silly putty bootlegger cove clay 
middle town right one three expressway anchorage accessible 
struggled emergency operation center recently 
and think wrap functional area maybe outside 
emergency operate center become untenable get many folk radio telephone 
see commander stand top desk scream 
top voice shut 
and sudden get quiet 
and day later 
but really careful number people emergency operation center 
obviously get police fire public work utility office emergency management state representative medical folk health human service military liaison school district red cross amateur radio 
and like get comment anyone get see miss could kick 
and plan get think tank 
think important people stay arm length event kind sit back determine strategy 
advance planning 
logistics wise course get purchasing material handle supply type thing obtain employee finance course go try finance pay cost accounting 
get three emergency action level 
normal operation get minor emergency every day fire department police department 
and major emergency actually activate eoc 
and recently mount spun eruption give problem 
and course level major disaster really commit resource 
good response force practice practice practice 
last four year previous year series exercise 
june municipal exercise get act together new player 
and next year joint one 
folk fema come give old central city scenario throw everything kitchen sink test see well could 
and state alaska one 
and municipality anchorage alaska railroad exercise 
and recently march shaker earthquake exercise full blown exercise show real problem 
good exercise good participation within municipality utility well could become familiar way operate 
understand sensitivity problem get damage assessment become real emotional operation get house place business shut access 
really work hard damage assessment improve recovery response 
use apply technology conference procedure 
that commonly know atc 
and october well receive attended training session perform damage assessment 
around people attend private public sector engineer technician 
that kind give feel interest 
and hear discussion volunteer show need 
let tell go need every one get arm around kind earthquake damage 
the exercise jointly sponsor municipality anchorage alyeska pipeline 
very well do 
they go rapid visual screening technique 
prior fire chief mention use helicopter quick aerial overview kind get arm around problem 
take red cross folk fire chief damage assessment people give quick feel 
and follow rapid visual screening building detail methodical evaluation 
and use typical green yellow red card green enter yellow caution red course entry 
and one want make good shot call right first around 
and course try come expedited building permit procedure get process quickly possible get folk back foot 
mention one thing building code 
they kick around quite bit 
and think consensus pretty good shape building code 
uniform building code series many year good code 
cover earthquake mitigation 
anchorage zone stringent uniform building code 
and also go step 
you see map outside show color cod breakdown anchorage five code five zone say 
increasingly stringent requirement depend type facility area facility may necessary look liquefaction slope stability mass waste even look possibility stabilization someone build bad area critical facility 
the financial assistance program probably one go learning lesson 
and certainly take note thing folk say operation 
depend upon magnitude earthquake obviously go increase level support 
state alaska first get governor declare emergency 
then come fema 
and sure probably watch disaster last couple year fema get tagged area usually grade medium maybe lot case degrade quickly respond 
and would hope practice get quickly event 
and prepared support 
disaster assistance center dacs small business administration 
and course would hope red cross department defense would provide usual assistance many event 
then lastly put slide read give feel educational program try increase awareness earthquake 
this page local telephone book 
this typical type handouts information provide develop awareness 
but really mother nature take care around hardly three four month go get little tremor little wiggle somewhere keep aware rim fire 
you good prepare 
but like relate one war story quake 
some thing stick mind event sort experience 
let see friday afternoon 
left base go bank government hill right next elmendorf air force base get weekend mad money 
and fill check cash slip across teller 
and time start 
and course smile smile 
that always hundreds tremor ever increase frequency big shaker 
but one quit 
keep right go 
about time get hit head light fixture ceiling say good get outside 
ran outside car 
and literally hung car oscillate way could stand wave would come 
and literally wave 
say amplitude foot 
other would swear foot trough peak 
but could see pavement ripple 
you could hear concrete grate grinding 
incredible force 
and time start hear think small arm fire 
and figure know small arm fire automatic weapon 
and figure 
go rat tat tat tat tat rat tat tat tat 
and start see bolt fall around 
and live know alascom tower foot tall right area 
that tower spit bolt creation 
but stay 
but anyway forget 
and take back base leap couple crevice old ford make sure family head office emergency operate center 
didn need money anyway pretty busy two week work hour day 
didn buy food provide color can ever see another ration year much 
two week later decide time mad money 
go back bank walk entrance 
the teller lady ready fill check 
and say you need 
but ready 
be percent ready 
well go tell 
charles already mention seismologist geologist bless heart keep try improve predictability 
but tell week next wednesday go happen know 
percent ready 
could could predict close 
but think close enough come without great great problem 
and thank much 
question comment audience hudson ken hudson matanuska susitna borough 
question come utility life line 
what situation alternative power source instance intertie fairbanks 
power suffer major damage local generate facility switch 
would thatjust something go deal individually 
canfield expert area 
but know utility get option backup system 
the switch ideal point 
they continue improve 
may utility people might able good answer 
anybody want take one 
but really qualified answer question 
mall bob mall matanuska electric 
chugach electric probably answer question 
but like talk little bit 
may sound like little bit pitch think really 
think get realistic 
talk yesterday reliability gas electricity 
and know nothing percent reliable 
hand climate sort extremes temperature like talk 
think realize earthquake situation fairbanks example earthquake probably go earthquake time vice versa 
order protect course need backup power call loop feed low 
and sound like pitch think get put point 
go talk situation matter earthquake proof possibility generate facility could break tremendous earthquake 
and way situation power line fairbanks capable deliver power would need keep minor thing go 
think seriously think support legislature area 
because climate need line 
not generate facility fairbanks could support totally certainly could keep go 
and least freeze death 
talk traffic light everything els chaos would thing operate 
and know talk little standby generator 
but limit 
and really want think thing like area climate ought think facility upgrade carry power available end system 
sound like pitch think time earthquake thing pitch one way another 
think talk survival 
aho thank 
roger comment 
head get question charles eadie 
charles say week give hat incident commander 
and wonder could spend couple minute talk long last eoc kind fold back get back normalcy government 
eadie well still back normalcy government 
that easy question 
but actually way work moved command center downtown modify 
and keep peeling piece need anymore 
example keep logistics keep public information 
and add whole slew new position deal particular task 
then complete task start peel away 
real fine thing end 
but gradually take away piece 
december really minimal operation 
and kind oflike happen watsonville gary 
say kept go around first year 
two half month 
and like say nothing normal since 
aho get one quick question ken 
consider shaker exercise one two item city work city really leam exercise 
could comment 
canfield bob want try 
that deeper one 
stewart bob stewart municipality anchorage 
one thing learn shaker exercise march could effectively operate logistics function physically separate main hoc operation 
put logistics function separate location 
tried tie hot line 
try tie computer optical scanner computer location optical scanner 
and still work 
one thing learned policy everyone report eoc location east 80th main fire department area 
and plan take entire fire department area people duty supplement need municipality standpoint 
and ken talk go medium center set truck bay area nice cold press 
and rest logistics function operate fire prevention area eoc 
still work go legislature request fund fact modify entire area make functional place everyone report 
one thing learn may necessarily relate earthquake exercise 
but volcano episode could also apply moderate earthquake sometimes need entire eoc operation people 
during volcano episode develop call crisis action team 
now may call something els later make synonymous general community 
but team fact able handle situation standpoint monitor city status take care press inquiry maintain contact municipal agency involve response 
core group able handle situation rather activate entire eoc 
but token keep direct contact mayor municipal manager everything go 
kind downsized eoc operation 
allows efficient 
those two thing think change last year 
this page leave blank 
global perspective postearthquake rebuild george mader william spangle associate inc portola valley california like start say pleasure back anchorage 
last time previous trip start research project look problem postearthquake rebuild 
select three city study san fernando santa rosa anchorage 
sense real difference attitude since 
told rather pointedly politically people want discuss earthquake anchorage 
that good put one mind 
certainly healthy see discussed format real interest topic 
think progress make 
comment morning go base largely information international symposium hold stanford university organize firm fund national science foundation 
people come various country talk rebuild problem 
some people today involve symposium 
charles eadie talk experience santa cruz 
mike dever 
paula schultz don alspach deputy planning director anchorage also involve 
first need tell earthquake unique attract everyone attention instant 
natural event way 
everyone earthquake recall exactly particular moment 
testimony several speaker 
from time forward next hour day month even year people involve way recover earthquake 
first hour follow earthquake separate action take individual rather chaotic environment save life establish communication 
day follow people organization come together united coordinate effort care injured clean debris begin repair community 
the final healing rebuild community however take year 
recently increase attention pay problem recover earthquake rebuild community major damage earthquake 
learn experience expect solve rebuild problem 
your conference make major contribution topic particularly anchorage area 
like provide overview recovery reconstruction process offer suggestion action take anticipation future earthquake 
use examples several city different part world 
instructive review history recover country provide insight potential magnitude type problem might face also experience confirm lesson learn country 
now fortunately experienced extreme devastation earthquake cause part world 
face overwhelming damage loss 
this part due good construction country 
hand really test modem large city metropolitan region great earthquake 
the alaska earthquake occur year ago test large metropolitan area 
the loma prieta whittier earthquakes best test 
but neither display full potential recent great earthquake 
presentation go show lot slide 
let tell little bit country involve 
these chronological order 
the earthquake skopje yugoslavia magnitude kill people 
alaska magnitude people die tsunami 
santa rosa magnitude death 
san fernando great awaken california magnitude people kill 
magnitude friali northern part italy people kill 
the magnitude tangshan china people kill 
absolutely incredible 
and even question accuracy number 
could higher 
southern italy magnitude compana basilica area people kill 
asnam algeria magnitude plus people kill 
coalinga california magnitude death 
mexico city magnitude least kill 
whittier california magnitude death 
armenia magnitude kill 
loma prieta magnitude kill 
you see large difference foreign event earthquake country 
although point really great earthquake yet hit one major metropolitan area 
now like slide 
this time line call 
generalize session rebuild action take earthquakes extend year longer 
address rehabilitation rebuild general sense specifically business recovery housing public facility public service financing 
now earthquake 
prior pre earthquake mitigation preparedness 
and large topic 
after earthquake broken time line three phase 
the first two month phase emergency relief 
could one month might slightly longer 
then maybe period two year phase short term recovery 
then maybe year long term recovery 
now general classification 
and overlap bit 
but discussion purpose address define 
need anticipate sequence event earthquake 
need remind best defense offense 
that hold true mitigation period go thing right advance reduce damage earthquake 
however matter perfectly advance work always go surprise earthquake go deal 
go address slide examples action phase 
then phase iii 
one first thing course clearance destroy building 
this watsonville 
simply get rid thing fall brick forth clear area 
whittier pile brick simply truck 
that one early thing 
you clear mess lie around 
then inventory leave 
part post building safety 
this santa cruz 
the building post green yellow red 
here red tag 
say building safe enter 
mark country 
here shot italy building tag 
asnam cod building color indication build say safe enter 
this do around world initial classification 
also classify ground failure 
you know area 
turnagain landslide 
this quite obvious landslide 
these failure need mapped earthquake 
there also may area grind failure less obvious 
these area mark map 
this one early map alaska earthquake show area high risk ground failure fourth avenue street turnagain area 
you restrict people go thing do adequate job define hazard setting standard building 
santa cruz mountains major area landslide problem 
here large area outline care take action reconstruct 
the mapping refined period time progressive 
short time event initial kind work do 
now go look business area 
this coalinga earthquake immediately set boundary prevent people go damage area 
talk santa cruz charles mention cordon area keep people downtown set perimeter fence anyone admit do great care 
and course charles point business owner want get back quickly 
here potenza southern italy 
this area central part old city 
block begin reconstruct central area 
while deal business area need emergency shelter become issue 
here coalinga people tent trailer try stay close home 
watsonville tent set park emergency shelter 
this skopje yugoslavia earthquake see temporary makeshift shelter type could come 
and rather interesting shot 
this asnam algeria large tent set outside city massive destruction take place city 
well let look public facility service 
this highway santa cruz mountain loma prieta earthquake highway go san jose santa cruz 
see half road cover landslide traffic rerouted side 
result extreme traffic control problem help people get across mountain critical link 
minor problem occur water tank shift foundation resultant need make emergency connection 
and one chaotic scene 
this telephone building san fernando earthquake bank relay properly brace tumble 
look like complete chaos try reestablish communication 
the damage could avoid would probably minor adjustment bracing 
then emergency work patch street show watsonville 
they simply bring asphalt begin patch street 
you see side building structure still cordon 
now let talk happen little late 
this phase generally two month two year period 
demolition take place rebuild plan start temporary site establish business temporary housing maybe build 
this heavy stuff demolition 
this downtown santa cruz crane show take building 
now wreck ball hit 
this earthquake damage hill town southern italy 
there bit clear street rubble could remove 
basically town shake apart earthquake force probably focus hill 
the debris disposal problem show base hill 
they begin pile rubble city bit bit 
here mexico city demolishing hospital 
they major problem move debris earthquake illustrate truck line demolition site remove remnant build 
and embarcadero freeway san francisco still tear loma prieta earthquake 
many people please torn consider blight waterfront 
this example point additional problem earthquake public opinion may cause change plan case cause freeway torn 
also oakland cypress freeway structure damage torn community like way divide community 
case design question come play 
now turn plan rebuild 
here city manager coalinga begin work public meeting 
note banner say the spirit coalinga live begin establish plan reconstruction city 
look city asnam algeria map do core city show area high hazard 
the analysis do earthquake identify problem liquefaction shake 
through analysis determine old city minimal additional construction new growth south east city 
example plan rebuild base analysis make earthquake 
now let look temporary business location 
here business coalinga completely demolish 
what happen 
well trailer bring temporary commercial site virtually across street 
here hardware build coalinga could still use customer allow building 
clerk meet customer door go inside get request item 
and already see santa cruz set temporary pavilion displace business 
the pavilion still even long earthquake 
this business street tangshan china earthquake 
lot construction rubble 
simply rebuild temporary structure whatever material available 
everyone try establish temporary business site 
now temporary housing 
coalinga fema bring trailer 
you saw watsonville 
understand fema go business therefore solution may available future 
this aerial photo show outskirts asnam 
want point regular pattern make housing area 
look closely see temporary housing built earthquake 
these prefab house bring around world 
they present solution immediate problem problem long run population pressure unlikely torn 
they standard building 
they adequate hot climate 
you see rough site 
building temporary housing probably make addition city would wish could consider carefully long period time 
here tangshan china 
after city shake apart rebuilt area light weight roof one story 
old part city see acres acre kind building 
here city southern italy 
and look closely see quite bit damage 
house knock 
there damage throughout 
what temporary housing 
here little trailer line road way city 
the trailer must come country 
this also southern italy prefab unit different design 
these bring various part western europe 
some unit remote location completely prefab steel structure plumb everything instal 
they bring helicopter set 
remarkable see way country europe organize provide kind emergency temporary housing 
also problem major repair public facility 
here asnam ground aqueduct water 
the aqueduct fail water supply longer available make temporary repair 
this may realize civic center 
another city southern italy 
the public building damage earthquake 
these prefab steel structure bring house municipal function 
communication transportation line also concern 
here rail line bent due ground movement earthquake algeria 
obviously use fix 
and dramatic damage see san francisco oakland bay bridge 
finally phase iii last somewhere order two year 
include rebuild business district building permanent housing new public facility 
here santa rosa retrofit unreinforced masonry building 
you see interior brace put strengthen building building maintain original 
exterior feature 
many case old building torn 
note build next unreinforced masonry building completely redo inside outside 
nearby however many block old unreinforced masonry building community decision clear site completely erect new shopping center anchor downtown area 
now closer home back fourth street landslide redevelopment take place intense use federal fund build new commercial area 
just earthquake bold architectural concept develop rebuild downtown anchorage 
this point exuberance follow disaster improve upon whatever development exist prior earthquake 
but large plan become much modest time reality difficulty carry sink 
there many example 
certainly happen anchorage earthquake show although new building perhaps way relate plan 
but dramatic clearance whole downtown rebuild happen 
there also discussion move downtown core area outside city certainly stay around idea long 
here coalinga clear site downtown area 
but hardly anybody rebuild 
because economy sufficient support 
and mexico city building demolish next site building 
and tell vacant site go remain park 
now positive step forward crowd downtown area carve new area open space 
hope remain way 
here northern italy friali earthquake 
there heavy damage town rather go massive clearance rebuild one style architectural team work individual family discuss type housing want rebuilt 
then unit develop 
while look like project nonetheless developed participation occupant house 
apparently quite successful term adapted culture people area 
here back tangshan china new housing go outside city 
the floor area per family small incredibly improve rubble build housing show minute earlier 
mexico city certain flair postearthquake design 
these shot new residential housing go earthquake show bright color contemporary building design 
now look leninakan armenia 
rather lot rebuild old part city design entire new extension city 
the russian work participation armenian 
the city extension example detailed architectural site planning grand scale 
this entire area new 
the building precisely lay open space carefully design 
show go build sea 
crane put housing rapidly 
matter year large amount new housing rebuilt 
the housing terribly attractive architecturally get job do 
well another place know 
this valdez sit unenviable location 
valdez believe city completely relocate earthquake build model actually construct 
and course completely federally finance 
that go norm 
probably one dramatic rebuilding major city skopje yugoslavia 
this core area massive planning project go year involve international team 
the final product along river front reflect much careful design work team 
closing want leave recommendation 
tried presentation describe problem likely face three phase earthquake recovery reconstruction 
each earthquake unique however 
while may able anticipate damage general sense cannot anticipate detail 
need take many measure earthquake possible minimize damage also prepared deal postearthquake problem 
base forego would like draw conclusion regard important action take prior earthquake facilitate reconstruction 
group recommendation three topic sense realism orderly house test orderly house 
first realism 
earthquake fun easy fix 
large economic condition exist community earthquake shape recovery 
those community thrive economy earthquake generally recover rebuild rapidly 
stagnate community recover slowly 
you expect miracle 
for instance current economy vast influx federal money help rebuild many damage community alaska earthquake may repeat 
alaskan may rely resource rebuild 
this require advance consideration rebuild might carry 
consider difference alaska federal money use project buttress fourth avenue relocation rebuild valdez port reconstruction seward 
certainly aid come federal emergency management agency aid limit slow come 
nonetheless fema assistance important 
second house order 
mean need date set information plan regulation greatly facilitate rebuild process 
let mention component 
have date general plan city future desire change city already identify 
this plan provide critical guidance rebuild 
have good data base 
map show building type underlie geology 
this base facilitate pinpointing damage earthquake provide basis move rapidly plan rebuild 
have date code especially date building code guide strengthen damage building postearthquake reconstruction 
give special attention retrofit historic building since difficult deal face interest preserve old building 
prepared expand staff handle increased workload particularly respect build permit request several fold 
have emergency power ordinance establish prior event put operation immediately earthquake 
identify advance type hazard damage might expect earthquake ground failure tsunami building damage infrastructure damage 
consider approach respond damage 
identify potential site temporary housing business location 
word think ahead might happen well prepared respond 
assign someone keep date fema regulation 
the complexity involve obtain fema aid much great would imagine 
have expert represent city could make major difference prepare work fema earthquake actually work fema 
fema regulation static 
someone need stay current 
third finally test orderly house 
common year conduct emergency response exercise city 
test emergency responder largely police fire test ability respond immediate aftermath earthquake 
this essential training 
common however test city ability recover rebuild earthquake 
you test whether place information plan guideline mention orderly house 
order test readiness deal recovery rebuild phase good procedure develop earthquake scenario city involve agency interest would major responsibility rebuild recovery 
individual would probably involve would include city manager plan director director public work director park community service building inspector police chief fire chief 
this kind exercise recently conduct two city california 
one city pleasanton september one city los angel earlier month 
each exercise last one day simulate recovery reconstruction process occur two year period 
such exercise use pinpoint inadequacy orderly house thereby identify action take improve 
major assistance city earthquake prone area test readiness recover rebuild future earthquake 
reconstruction anchorage follow the earthquake george sharrock former mayor anchorage alaska afraid talk little mundane excite talk hear earthquake mechanism early response emergency period 
mine go long range reconstruction 
feel little bit unprepared 
and even word word seminar slide chart 
all give audio 
day two earthquake read periodical experience great teacher little perverse way act 
first give test 
and learn something lesson later 
march 27th really prepared ready test 
and go give reason 
most appreciate extent power earthquake 
know anything earthquake mechanism 
and know might happen 
occasional earthquake period year 
but low magnitude far away 
think think really large earthquake would happen even though century four five earthquake magnitude part alaska 
the reason ready civil defense organization prepared earthquake disaster 
when become mayor two half year earthquake one first job try reorganize civil defense organization sort disintegrate 
and one first job convince council get director civil defense city 
but find long national emphasis time fallout shelter 
felt fallout shelter since three mile runway elmendorf air force base atomic bomb drop elmendorf wipe downtown fallout shelter would use 
our budget time also kind low 
the previous year slow year military construction 
our economy time great 
timber fish tourism military construction military establishment large part economy particularly anchorage 
budget good 
and march early march city council decide cut budget civil defense organization objection 
but do 
three week earthquake civil defense director resign protest civil defense director time earthquake 
fortunately even earthquake make inspection round anchorage 
and stop civil defense headquarters east fifth avenue 
there find civil defense director resign 
spot rehired come back city 
come night work night think next three day night like 
that indicate specific plan book earthquake disaster 
and respect source information recollect many thing 
course busy emergency early day earthquake 
but go talk although many fascinate story could tell thing happen alaska follow earthquake first day first week 
you know earthquake affect large area alaska 
there damage square mile alaska 
and percent population one way another affect earthquake 
sure realize earthquake lasted four minute create lot damage 
one source information tonight one six book publish national academy science entitle the great alaska earthquake human ecology 
the day quake appoint member anchorage reconstruction commission one city councilman chairman 
this commission represent banking business city planning state legislature chamber commerce alaska railroad alaska general contractor many other add later time 
but day earthquake 
our city council many special meeting next two three day earthquake 
and monday 30th pass resolution require legally order get assistance state federal government 
learned period time much legal information order pas resolution 
through next week council involve many meeting meet federal housing administration urban renewal alaska state housing authority small business administration branch department defense 
also make plan city manager staff emergency restoration utility service many matter 
after april 3rd council pass resolution urban renewal downtown slide area 
sure familiar 
april 7th pass another resolution urban renewal tumagain height housing area 
the action work would conduct corp engineer 
the council also approve application million accelerated public work need earthquake reconstruction early stage 
also approve request governor alaska revenue loss anticipate fiscal year 
the fund would come federal government special legislation state would distribute 
like say time state federal agency involve period time really make outstanding effort every one speed reconstruction project within constraint law 
they course law abide 
there almost continuous contact exchange information agency council city law department city engineering department civil defense police fire department city utility department order speed fast could do 
from first night alert possibility shortage necessary supply include fuel 
next day however inventory take certain would problem 
knew although port receive damage possible dock ship discharge cargo 
knew could get supply short order 
learn first day city department employee well train equip good job disaster condition 
there mistake make even though specific plan earthquake emergency even though damage infrastructure action difficult slow normal condition 
geologic study make five year earlier robert miller ernest dobrovolny geological survey 
these study indicate certain area soil instability downtown anchorage 
certain distribution report call attention earthquake 
describe damage work do agency agency involve reconstruction 
most destruction anchorage earth slide 
fourth avenue slide virtually structure square block almost completely destroyed 
this damage downslope movement land trigger seismic wave action 
study boring indicate underlying bootlegger cove clay high water content therefore low viscosity 
determine corps engineer excavate material clay deposit instal drainage system refill gravel result buttress would stabilize land upgrade south withstand future earthquakes similar intensity 
urban renewal request make mention alaska state housing authority fund design construction propose project 
approve construction corp engineer begin year later earthquake finish 
the urban renewal project specify land use buttress area would restrict 
low building would permit third fourth avenue specify foundation 
but area north third avenue would need use park park area 
the major destruction anchorage earth slide tumagain sea housing area 
this similar slide downtown cause factor 
for almost mile foot bluff foot deep back front bluff earth collapse move sea home destroy 
after hearing condemnation proceeding home bulldoze rubble pile burn corps engineer 
this area grade slop ocean 
urban renewal propose come time final approval city council turn 
later proper test find make area self 
stabilize due great amount earth move improved natural drainage system grade work do 
title land resurvey retain former private owner 
and since progress make put new road even housing development plan 
the call street slide along bluff western end downtown anchorage 
large block land five six block long three block wide wide move diagonally toward northwest foot 
this create graben run southwest northeast perhaps foot deep 
the lateral movement block course sever underground water sewer electrical connection 
create uplift toe block bottom slope destroyed property 
although area designate previous report engineering geology evaluation group scientific engineering task group presidential commission high risk stabilization plan make area ever acceptable feasible 
gradually build permit approve several large building block land one luxury hotel complex whose private consultant produce thoroughly investigated report indicate construction would safe 
now state court building across street fourth avenue area 
several building build area since 
however one building block earthquake 
believe six story apartment building 
the building move intact whole foot little damage building except course disconnect utility 
and since renovate still stand fully utilized 
there couple slide mention large 
one government hill primary school build 
and saw slide yesterday destruction school 
well school raze far know construction site 
grade leave 
the one fifth avenue native hospital 
you saw slide yesterday happen 
but federal land 
and stabilization do sure 
foot slide gallon oil tank city use store oil run gas turbine generator case emergency 
and earthquake tank develop leak 
they start production electricity short time quake 
but run two hour oil leak 
get military oil haul military base truck 
and run sunday morning gas company gas line repair 
there many building single multi story structure damage seismic ground wave 
most minor damage repair 
and area speak hazard area 
other public property city state federal high hazard zone reconstruct mostly 
the cost cover federal disaster fund fund several federal agency special program 
private property owner aid several program loss destruction 
the principal one heard low interest disaster loan make small business administration 
and great help private owner residential people private home also business 
and business even able get low interest rate loan debts prior earthquake 
private property owner mortgage whose property destroy even badly damage aid another way 
the congress pass legislation would pay balance mortgage mortgagee loss percent property value earthquake 
the alaska legislature also pass similar legislation federal government state contribute equally aid fund 
each appropriation million program 
call mortgage adjustment program 
incidentally something program 
become commissioner commerce 
and application come aid 
about something little approve 
the approval make state department commerce fannie mae federal organization set handle state 
the aid money incidentally pay directly mortgagee mortgagor 
this sort complete review badly damage area 
could long time particularly outside anchorage tsunami damage wave cause subside underwater land 
but time 
go miss although important recovery process 
shall attempt name problem conflict encounter reconstruction period 
the federal reconstruction development plan commission alaska appoint president next day earthquake day two aim 
one avoid place reconstruction work crash basis avoid inflationary pressure 
and number two use much alaska labor possible 
and desirable standpoint well 
however first one clash need ready usual alaska summer season work 
alaska businessmen worker much interested summer work season annual income earn 
federal agency charge plan ensure federal law regulation follow reconstruction project 
local official course almost always interested follow desire constituent protect constituent interest 
often goal conflict result costly delay important job reconstruction anchorage almost every town involve major destruction 
many federal regulation design protect speak 
for example one rule prevent reconstruction highly hazardous zone 
and happen anchorage 
highly hazardous zone designate prevent loss life property event another violent earthquake 
many local citizen believe city justify change zone law would prohibit restoration reconstruction private property 
the government agency respond government way finance reconstruction able deny aid law regulation follow 
otherwise contend aid could lead people apathetic careless guard future disaster 
this kind conflict occur almost every community 
the geologist valid persuasive argument advice take 
however business people resident answer also believe valid 
they maintain strong earthquake occur frequently 
and might year another disastrous earthquake occur 
propose city center move less hazardous area someone point earlier 
but businessmen maintain move city center would take much time many business could fail bankruptcy employee would work long period time displace 
the political pressure rebuild repair present sit great 
evident area affect tendency local official resident evade termed radical proposal unless argument overwhelmingly strong 
local every case apply urban renewal would require land acquire urban renewal 
there would private property leave title private property leave project 
the science engineering task force make follow recommendation future guidance number one try improve earthquake prediction technology 
number two improve tsunami warn system 
three designate earthquake hazard zone populate area 
four require earthquake building code 
improve expand seismograph station 
exchange earthquake technology information japan 
improve worldwide participation set federal national disaster planning 
many recommendation know implement probably many propose since 
your theme seminar be prepared 
from know agency charge anchorage anchorage area immediate response disaster plan appear adequate 
randy updike yesterday apparently believe prepared 
but look possible cause loss life property mainly build destruction either faulty design construction hazardous land 
would seem criticism might direct almost city earthquake prone area 
however doubt correct 
call good inspection design construction building build hazardous area perhaps anywhere 
since instability soil indeed culprit anchorage area need find ingenious way stabilize soil area already develop 
understand improvement stabilization especially japanese 
connection improve enforcement regulation require zone law would prohibit certain land use hazardous area would suggest zoning requirement 
phase long period maybe year 
this would give property owner time amortize investment 
cite law pass florida year ago zone near beach area 
florida frequent hurricane know 
and usually storm pass sea land vice versa 
many home destroy hurricane create wave beach 
the new law require new construction beach lower specify height high tide build live quarter raise one story ground building design water flow low portion 
with provision expect many building save 
however state require home already place condemn 
but grow old remove new structure must conform new zone law 
some zone law might designate hazardous zone earthquakeprone area full enforcement attain many year 
this page leave blank 
the hazard long term recovery paula schulz california office ofemergency service oakland california pleasure back alaska 
opportunity february participate eeri learn from earthquake series 
time ask talk emergency response social issue relate loma prieta earthquake 
that four month earthquake already pretty clear social issue recovery issue rebuild issue would one difficult resolve 
our experience emphasize need good recovery planning local state government level 
need look recovery process challenge opportunity 
the challenge put humpty dumpty back together 
and think opportunity put humpty back good take fall 
now probably never go look 
little cheek bash maybe one leg go shorter 
but fact take time put back together super glue instead scotch tape bolt brace wall retrofit wall crumble 
the state key role play short long term recovery effort 
the first thing want mention state get involved community impact 
today hear primarily santa cruz watsonville close epicentral region earthquake 
one thing need recognize entire bay area impact 
large area near epicenter strong shake widespread damage occur 
area liquefaction however occur south also far north 
fact medium attention immediate hour earthquake focus dramatic damage oakland san francisco 
really end three disaster try manage southern east bay san francisco 
and deserve equal attention 
assess state impact look dual responsibility state 
important remember responsible welfare citizen state california primary role support local government service population 
hand also responsibility state take care employee facility 
there three area state impact strongly kind disaster particularly earthquake 
they personnel financial facility 
many state agency involve recovery process 
for example office emergency service caltrans social service mental health department age department commerce state comptroller office franchise tax board office historic preservation department education housing community development last perhaps least attorney general office 
staff variety agency assign new duty beyond regular task 
frequently ask find solution problem never encounter 
often train get thejob training 
still tally final cost loma prieta earthquake 
estimate loss might reach billion 
look get pay right estimate less percent cost cover disaster assistance fund 
need explore creative financing mechanism recovery program 
the state bear percent disaster assistance program cost 
loma prieta state also cover local cost understand normal procedure alaska 
one way try get additional fund help repair reconstruction process statewide sale tax 
percent sale tax effect month 
however inadequate cover need cost 
the state own property earthquake area well anyone els 
and seem particularly california government building seem take lion share damage sometimes 
this slide show state office build downtown oakland 
look bad severe structural damage 
part building evacuate immediately earthquake 
the rest evacuate close two month later analysis damage do 
there also major problem building asbestos significantly contribute closing 
the building still sit exactly october 
time decision make whether repair demolish 
all employee building relocate 
people work home 
they telecommuting 
meeting hold restaurant 
and occur time suppose provide support come solution handle disaster 
addition deal employee need communicate public 
you get able let people know service normal facility 
this slide show marine research lab moss land area 
this virtually new million facility area high liquefaction potential 
reconstruction alternative facility yet occur 
probably long term recovery problem state highway system 
this slide show infamous cypress structure run oakland 
about mile doubledeck freeway collapsed 
prior earthquake freeway carry somewhere order truck per day primarily come port oakland large container shipping port 
the closure freeway still affect 
sit traffic 
create air pollution 
cost continue 
the structure demolish fairly quickly 
there lot rubble something around order ton section freeway 
creative solution debris removal storage find 
this slide show final little section leave stand test theory structure fail 
some oscillator put run number test 
this slide show failure point second level fit first 
and see really clearly 
one sequence demolition shot 
one thing tend think state agency people affect impact 
tend get blinder 
quick efficient way possible 
think need leam get touch community 
and frequently go come back show 
this slide show west oakland area actually see section cypress freeway right 
that low deck 
some collapse 
but run right neighborhood 
people live earthquake 
they live earthquake 
they live hour search rescue operation hour demolition floodlight generator incredible noise incredible vibration shake 
you know people lose mind 
they finally arrange demolition would stop clock even start morning give people least opportunity try get sleep 
another aspect community really want freeway put back 
obviously simple solution 
that caltrans mind put back right 
well year year hearings different plan different model new route 
construction expect start maybe complete 
this show another double deck freeway embarcadero freeway san francisco 
for embarcadero lot question whether could repair repair could city take opportunity get rid 
many felt eyesore 
and lot people side issue 
some business district tourism industry fisherman wharf chinatown wanted structure repair repair quickly access business 
and nobody want sit traffic come around side get 
initially do try figure go structure shore 
still potential hazard 
get structural damage 
aftershock could bring 
fairly intricate system reinforce place level try keep traffic foot traffic continue underneath 
cost million simply shore structure protect life safety 
eventually demolish 
there still section access ramp currently process demolition 
again do goal keep traffic run keep business open 
think one unique thing embarcadero even though state facility legislation pass turn control future freeway city county san francisco 
turn decision whether would demolish rebuilt rebuilt 
do corporation state 
but decision control belong local government 
another double deck freeway central freeway 
again see slide brace try strengthen shore facility 
the earthquake really teach know structure engineering 
lot great design concept 
think code pretty good 
but get right figure thing make structurally sound afterwards extremely difficult 
lot money spend quick fix adequate research analysis do 
what happen governor appoint board inquiry look number issue relate highway system 
but one thing create 
independent review panel look repair do take look longterm retrofit program state involve freeway structure 
the independent panel discover retrofit work go repair inadequate go cause problem 
whole process halt 
and still work slowly 
another topic area want focus legislation 
there incredible opportunity within first year disaster 
all landmark seismic legislation state california pass follow damage earthquake the field act long beach earthquake hospital safety act san fernando earthquake 
the year loma prieta earthquake also big year legislation 
during legislative session bill introduce include word seismic safety earthquake 
sign law 
and really broad range 
many related disaster assistance relief 
one mention state sale tax 
this statewide 
and actually lot support expect would get 
because california area susceptible kind earthquake 
guess felt well put money maybe get back turn 
tax relief provide business loss homeowner take burden recovery cost 
small business grant provide try get business run quickly possible 
some fund allocate legislation historical state park repair reconstruction 
also couple deal residential loss 
one caldap program try address need people qualify loan resource equity qualify low interest loan 
this alternate program could 
rather unique program instated follow loma prieta call california residential earthquake relief fund crerf 
the concept lot home minor damage damage fairly simple repair 
what find homeowner earthquake insurance majority come deductible deductible 
initiate program whereby think fee per year add homeowner insurance come due buy program whereby follow event could eligible repair 
the idea take burden disaster assistance program 
the crerf program activate follow cape mendocino earthquake april year well landers big bear earthquake end june 
able analysis program well work 
but occur since law repeal 
probably poorly write law 
language really make mandatory people buy 
and fairly clear fund could break one serious earthquake really inadequate 
folk much chimney damage go figure different way pay 
disaster assistance 
start section say everything heard disaster assistance process true 
there easy answer 
the system complex 
agree wholeheartedly george mader say earlier 
really responsibility local jurisdiction state know regulation know law 
kind like deal tax know state federal tax 
you get booklet irs 
kind lay 
but tell take advantage system best way 
and really relate disaster assistance process well 
there really go anyone come federal government say well gee thing get 
you really need aggressive right know regs understanding regs look interpretation regs 
and find administrator may interpret slightly differently 
get city attorney involve 
long term process 
this slide show last building repair san femando sylmar earthquake 
take year close claim 
the two program agency governor office emergency service get involve individual assistance public assistance program 
individual assistance program parallel federal individual assistance program 
double amount grant fund individual resource qualify loan 
brings total per individual 
public assistance real long term program 
there least four area really careful look public assistance process 
probably important aspect call code standard 
the fund eligible repair pay public assistance go highly connect current building code standard repair 
now emphasize strongly enough 
run lot problem earthquake 
know fix building cover code 
they older building 
they design build current code know seismic good 
and take time usually get code place 
you need something ready earthquake adopt quickly local ordinance legislation 
go get catch short 
damage survey report dsr write approved new code place lose great opportunity mitigation upgrade repair 
historic building real dilemma 
many damage enough really want tear 
the preservationist go oppose 
you go able tear 
these building long term problem 
really important outset try establish relationship state local historic board try come kind conclusion go deal building 
flood zone also come play 
flood seem govern everything disaster assistance 
but get approval dsr earthquake damage reassess flood zone building flood zone whether flood insurance 
kind back door approach get flood mitigation do 
the last issue probably controversial cost benefit 
and really come play amount fund may may available whether repair replace public facility 
couple example slide show city hall oakland close immediately earthquake structural damage 
thousand oakland employee relocate 
oakland hard hit community 
lose lot housing well deal implication cypress structure 
difficult decision make 
but really life safety issue 
believe dsr approve something like million repair building 
historically important 
culturally important 
and go take lot money put back together 
another example san francisco city hall 
now san francisco chose keep city hall open 
and make large point tell employee damage really cosmetic know worry crack 
put little shoring problem 
then apply dsr total seismic retrofit building 
you way 
structurally unsafe 
difficult make case building remain occupied three year 
still debate probably time 
that one area talk decision make early game affect long term recovery 
san francisco actually look building carefully close earthquake probably would successful get fund request 
history risk document put together historic preservation foundation try bring issue historic building light try make recommendation state process sensitive historic building come good solution 
the last topic would like address hazard mitigation 
this one great area opportunity earthquake 
one area think fema get enough credit 
there requirement opportunity within hazard mitigation process 
section public law one first thing learn loma prieta require hazard mitigation plan 
basically require state produce plan show go recovery go make community well reduce cost disaster assistance future 
the element hazard mitigation process section grant program 
provide matching fund fema make improvement structure property damage earthquake 
and provide unique opportunity upgrade facility might skate time might next time 
the beginning process develop call hazard mitigation survey team report 
this one follow loma prieta primarily put together state federal agency 
since loma prieta try incorporate local government planning process 
extremely difficult loma prieta require within two week earthquake 
local government time deal 
and lot state agency either 
but extent get local involvement postpone process local involvement available much strong report recommendation 
also require state submit hazard mitigation plan fema within day disaster 
fortunate california seismic safety commission legislate maintain hazard reduction plan 
and call california risk 
five year plan update annually 
fema recognize document state hazard mitigation plan earthquake 
really take quite load plan place 
that one thing deal first six month earthquake 
the plan also help lay priority might determine best use hazard mitigation grant fund eligible apply 
follow lorn prieta initiate grant program process 
receive proposal different applicant total million 
lot difficulty try pick best one 
one thing set proposal review team 
time look potential million federal side would match locally 
point million approval although last check two month ago million actually allocate pass 
the fund come slowly fema disaster reserve break 
there nothing disaster last three year 
certainly hurricanes andrew iniki go add problem 
find even project approve whether mitigation project disaster assistance project fund trail way behind approval 
get approval struggle enough could wait couple year fund come 
some kind thing able fund hazard mitigation grant program range nonstructural retrofit communication facility generator way seismic retrofit essential service building 
think san jose provide fund retrofit seven fire station 
the city santa cruz fairly unique program act sponsor behalf individual homeowner provide program whereby retrofit residence percent could pay hazard mitigation grant fund 
there lot opportunity really craft meet need community 
closing like emphasize point mention number time last two day 
that need interagency coordination 
something cannot overemphasize 
the state really key link local federal government 
saw hurricane andrew two day hurricane dade county say where cavalry 
what hear fema side offering resource 
the blockage apparently state level 
there probably lot version story 
really critical state advocate local jurisdiction run interference federal government 
know regulation 
provide information local jurisdiction 
go make process run whole lot smoother 
you get able establish relationship recovery process struggle really 
think close comment state go get away scot free 
the state may disaster victim 
but absolutely crucial state also able resource recovery 
question comment audience stewart curious effect california governor emergency declaration local government 
do free enough fund state legislature order make fund available beyond governor could make available 
schulz actually still enough fund everything need do 
the great benefit governor declare emergency free state resource flow assistance next step request federal declaration 
the governor maintain disaster contingency fund small reserve fund 
clearly inadequate deal thing beyond relief process 
inadequate deal recovery 
inadequate deal full relief system 
and one reason percent sale tax 
large amount money go repair retrofit freeway system 
part go caldap program low cost loan folks qualify regular disaster assistance program 
some go compensation death cypress structure 
think somewhere around million paid compensation victim victim family 
there lot unmet need 
and still look fund support effort 
one thing state also immediately try front federal reimbursement money local jurisdiction particularly fund would reimburse response debris clearing fund 
and able 
unidentified voice term mitigation hazard wonder thought issue liability touch death cause collapse cypress structure associate thing hear morning construction occur land study say unsafe 
then late study say ahead 
know area get people demand right develop 
and something happens 
and want sue allow first place 
have run looked term mitigation disaster 
schulz think deal much term development allow occur hazard occur 
there certainly suit build owner particularly unreinforced masonry building clear building hazard 
well know hazard 
and question come whether owner take reasonable step mitigate hazard 
almost lawsuit settle court 
and generally settle court disclosure amount settlement 
really use figure start try justify cost benefit mitigation 
because never end know actual cost loss 
think suit southern california relate landslide fact liability proven county 
they pay settlement 
also run number suit east bay hill fire oakland clear wildfire danger urban interface danger 
there suit east bay municipal utility district water utility oakland fire department name anybody may responsible allow development without appropriate water system need fire flow 
currently real debate development far south east bay hill along hayward fault 
think somewhere around people show public hearing night protest approval new development fire danger seismic danger 
and one think city oakland go ahead approval disaster go law suit 
this page leave blank 
community plan economic impact and permanent change the aftermath the loma prieta earthquake charles eadie emergency coordinator city watsonville watsonville california mention morning second part talk really go take happen first couple month transition emergency response short term recovery carry subsequent three year 
but want postscript couple thing 
that emergency response recovery important point keep mind incident command system 
you know command control system 
but really mean manage delegate 
and way thing really go effective let people field make decision 
give authority rise occasion 
time provide big picture make sure everybody move direction 
and way 
because try control go work 
there many thing happen much 
well santa cruz leave gotten christmas season 
and tremendous community wide effort survive get back foot get downtown open 
get demolition complete 
get safe area open 
part downtown reopen 
minimal amount fence 
and business pavilion go 
and six week effort probably intense experience everyone community 
the downtown small town like santa cruz town really special place 
public place 
people consider downtown public extension living room 
and people ready contribute respond way possible 
amaze thing happen almost euphoria swept community get initial six week 
santa cruz always least last year kind hatfields mccoys kind place politically 
matter interest 
sort right wrong 
agree somebody bad 
and agree bad 
and context people yap year 
funny thing happen disaster 
all political habit almost get set aside suspend 
and people political standpoint business people city council get along actually work side side 
they get busy work every awhile look say gosh really work person 
there real sense common purpose community purpose 
the net result feeling within community boy get rebuild go cinch 
work miracle 
and real sense miraculous effort 
the community response hour day 
thousand people work get downtown running 
even people anything particularly 
one point somebody organize energy something 
you know santa cruz right 
academic town 
they get people downtown hold hand around cordon area downtown sort send good vibe something 
feel boy really charge forward different place sustain sense community sense common purpose revert back old hatfield mccoy politics 
let give brief outline time span 
then slide tell happen 
picking leave see rescue phase postrescue phase immediate recovery first day 
and long range planning process 
and phase say gear sort month 
there real question 
sound pretty simple rebuild right 
but quite simple 
mean george mader always give good lead talk use exist plan general plan sort thing 
well santa cruz work general plan earthquake 
state flux 
downtown plan 
but philosophy downtown plan preserve everything way 
there people literally think need amend downtown plan 
read thing 
and say well 
you keep cover 
you keep back cover take sheet start amend plan 
the difference big difference recovery planning normal planning status quo option 
and think lot resistance change among people among community lot legitimate reason 
downtown santa cruz historic district 
and certain quality people really like wanted preserve time 
unfortunately historic preservation retrofit preservation last next big earthquake 
lot resource downtown area lose 
big fundamental question what nature beast 
be plan 
be revise exist plan 
pick start gear sort 
then get sort agreement well would plan look like would recovery plan look like one 
that take another three month 
and really year later actually get point agreement downtown recovery plan 
now raise interesting challenge people want move quickly time 
fast slow 
and recovery planning lot opposite pair couplet 
rebuild quickly act quickly move fast 
preserve past change 
these kind question ready answer 
take year get point begin actual preparation downtown recovery plan 
part reason take long political situation evolve year 
thing get do quickly 
but quickly also problem 
somebody come want rebuild 
and everybody want thing right 
and first building proposal come city council member say unfortunately look like barn 
well city council swallow pride oks new building 
quickly mayor decide head gottschalk department store 
they store downtown santa cruz 
they base fresno 
want get reopen 
and answer 
and back economics 
their store fine santa cruz torn cost building build sustain new rent structure build work way work old building low basis 
council say hurry vision santa cruz 
come first principle involve community 
town meeting get everybody come 
and amaze citizen participation 
first six month come suppose first principle 
complete first principle deal thing like build height two three story retain exist quality exist townscape 
but find first principle people agree whether start complete 
some people back politics want vision santa cruz exist 
and felt usurped normal power structure 
and people say vision santa cruz never recover 
folk say first principle fine 
the new mall monument consensus 
banker say first principle fine 
but go 
meanwhile economic situation continue apace lose money 
bring consultant right away 
million square foot right central core million whole downtown 
about third destroyed third damage third 
the economist come say well guys rebuild 
you get million square foot back fine 
but one trick 
you percent business ever percent business 
everybody say fine let 
but suddenly well wait minute 
how percent business downtown flat decline past 
suddenly put back way figure go take different economic structure 
banker always right way 
sensible project get loan 
and banker sensible 
kind wish sensible like 1980s 
banker suppose come give talk today find golf november anchorage 
but since say 
become real clear first six month still try figure need plan 
need plan 
what go 
and bring expert 
the guy come columbus ohio downtown columbus organization cradle grave downtown everything zone architectural review retail recruitment management 
and say yeah guy right 
take year recover 
and guy get run town rail people still think well go recover year maybe two year 
guess would say probably value think go easy 
because might get discourage work 
meanwhile rebuild 
college town plan plan 
professor pepper want santa cruz think globally rebuild downtown 
well try figure well go plan globe downtown santa cruz 
big fight overjust plan area go consider 
then issue design 
again historic character feature want retain 
people pretty much knew want 
historic preservation issue 
this building tore building behind wall shore wall 
and make interest short term situation 
and paula mention historic preservation real big issue 
this hotel call george hotel yellow tag first 
and red tagged 
and fight 
and newspaper say time take george historic panel want george save 
somebody els say well worn 
know keep around 
but people get little excited save george mall dragon 
there article paper 
everybody fight 
call high authority 
ask state california 
well much state official mum 
keep mum hotel 
ask state think 
they know 
while everybody argue thing george kind take care 
think spontaneous combustion 
then another issue 
listen everybody rebuild expert say 
that admirable thing 
and actually probably one important thing leam community feel lot downtown 
and go want express 
every sort public information public outreach know humankind 
vision santa cruz finally set downtown information center 
that year worth struggle 
some people think why need 
and other think great idea 
downtown information center community member build scale model building exist downtown 
people architectural background 
guy name michael angelo 
that true 
this guy name michael angelo organize 
furniture maker 
and say well need model downtown 
line volunteer tell building 
and give picture 
and come pretty well 
use scale model 
useful kind thing 
and start make architect build model streetscape go look like new building go like 
the need information community critical 
because plan go lot talk negotiation 
and people meanwhile walk around downtown say heck mess 
how come nothing happen 
and shard tell people 
they see 
they think nothing happen 
like how watch seed germinate 
nature planning 
people participate best could 
remember hold hand around fence 
and artist town say well dress hole 
and put neat little art project vacant space 
and guess people like 
and people 
award grant another person plan department january downtown recovery plan 
and think well go need downtown recovery plan 
that eight month everyone finally agree downtown recovery plan 
but apply grant gotten money help support plan 
take calculated risk 
when city manager find go give money back recovery plan finally agree yeah guess need recovery plan 
statistically couple thing kind keep mind 
first month thing gear create new redevelopment department 
plan planning department 
have redevelopment momentum change anything planning department business community concern 
redevelopment district create 
nonprofit public private partnership create member board director represent every possible group santa cruz 
first month four people serve chair group call vision santa cruz 
they board member first month 
then seven task force deal streetscape economics urban design park social problem name 
eleven consultant economic consultant design consultant infrastructure consultant engineer 
the urban land institute send team panel 
also institute half cent six year sale tax within county create financial resource 
receive nearly contribution 
vision santa cruz establish nonprofit corporation receive another kind contribution 
then public lecture six public hearing one town meeting five conference 
altogether vision santa cruz event public meeting board meeting committee meeting conference study session january may 
another recovery related meeting hold group 
meanwhile percent turnover personnel city hall 
and take month get downtown recovery plan 
come conclusion survive earthquake easy 
survive recovery process really need worry 
the first thing happen community disaster like mary hammer say yesterday 
people want carve pumpkin play soccer 
there real sense want normal 
because know never know different 
but first thing 
that hear first public want back way 
and remember good thing 
they remember charm outdoor cafe historic character vegetation 
but necessarily remember bad thing 
the vegetation get kind overgrown 
you get understand santa 
cruz environmental student kind interest 
and tree plant sometimes take sacredness 
india cow santa cruz tree 
the merchant meanwhile year say hey get prune dang tree 
nobody see display window 
before earthquake go process take nine month agree take six tree prune rest 
and politics tree 
then problem street people example 
think principle earthquake necessarily go change 
make problem already acute 
the business community argue downtown decline 
and felt second earthquake year worth decline 
other people think hey wonderful park 
and failure agree world look like prior earthquake 
well matter 
clear downtown change 
watsonville problem housing get expose many people live overcrowded condition garage sort thing 
they show come woodwork 
and many people number house neighborhood 
earthquake make apparent problem time might ignore hard time deal 
be academic town one best thing happen right away professor university organize lecture series 
really idea take positive look thing say opportunity 
opportunity correct problem address thing 
they bring really great people country lesson past public space reconsider value ordinary downtown life great street make place space 
these video 
and probably good course planning ever attend 
and community love lecture 
first lecturer mayor 
and question community time cooperate carry forward new momentum 
era cooperation begin 
vision santa cruz create 
but era cooperation begin people agree name group 
exactly auspicious start 
then people say well hell 
you know figure figure 
then course hurry 
whatever hurry 
create redevelopment district thing right away 
and keep mind thing right away real window opportunity 
get state legislature get bill pass 
there sort one time opportunity 
usually take year set redevelopment district number hearing fiscal analysis forth 
and get legislation allow santa cruz watsonville oakland establish district without go rigmarole 
you know controversial item 
put lighthouse middle downtown 
temporary one float base structure 
actually little concerned downtown flood plain 
and riparian vegetation start grow back 
and think gosh environmentalist go come say build riparian area wetland 
you know get corps engineer 
little worry 
then meeting organize time line real effort keep thing track keep thing move 
the problem citizen participation participation one thing get people agree little difficult 
and course disagree everything 
and fact lot people felt santa cruz kind place talk always product action 
lot university type enjoy talk 
and make provision 
but meantime example conflict 
the merchant say well need downtown park 
and folk say hey even want car mall 
fact planning planet 
and car way fossil fuel lose proposition long haul 
ought pedestrian mall 
resolve divergent viewpoint take awhile 
plan people consultant whole process show well maybe way accommodate everybody 
come scheme street car turn public plazas special event 
you fanners market close street temporary basis 
and reach compromise 
and finally see world look like come upon 
and think solution hit upon like call think globally park locally 
and really work 
lot meeting 
and take awhile reach agreement thing 
finally get merchant tree 
hard understand 
but merchant want tree 
see figured plant tree go get prune year 
they want tree 
and people want forest 
finally get something work everybody 
and approve plan month road 
good city 
vision santa cruz hung 
even give award hanging 
planning process 
and building get build right away 
part downtown open 
the requirement percent business make recovery longer difficult 
important doll pavilion go duration 
they finally take last one month three year later 
and initially suppose two month kind deal 
then longstanding problem correct 
the infrastructure street year old 
once get started rebuild downtown suddenly engineer 
show say get new sewer line 
and get new water line 
that well good 
except problem planning work community figure tree go 
because infrastructure incredibly intricate 
wait month start utility work 
then get start dig downtown 
and private project get go example rehabilitation old building 
and new building get construction 
but illustrate economics foundation cost build 
the guy own building pay entire building year 
the economics enormously challenge 
meanwhile watsonville ford get million sba loan large sba loan history small business administration 
and open october two year quake 
that amazing accomplishment 
then santa cruz ground break ceremony new george hotel 
and get start 
and couple new building 
that gray building get retrofit 
the new one get build 
and wall still hang 
three year later 
think one thing find money housing commercial 
actually two three year housing rebuilt repair 
these place watsonville 
some new housing new low income housing project build 
the reason housing get build sort money housing california anyone els 
but look get state department housing community development rental housing construction program city bank america 
got red cross money 
get special disaster relief city watsonville agriculture grant somebody foundation diocese monterey 
this put together project 
see time consume thing 
also get grant santa cruz watsonville federal government build parking structure 
and never give grant park structure 
and hard luck 
haber store close year business 
they tear part building rebuilt 
beautiful design 
year quake run 
but two year later business 
go earthquake try onset recession 
really bad timing 
and damned economist 
you know problem market know flex 
lose couple major project santa cruz intend square foot building leave big theater project suppose centerpiece downtown 
there personal circumstance problem 
the guy own building get washed yacht santa barbara two month earthquake whole estate dealt 
build sit long time 
and finally two year later 
get project set rehabilitate tear part build next put together burn 
real tragic loss 
and attribute fire homeless people live building 
now year three watsonville ford file bankruptcy 
the big success year two loss 
the local economy major factor 
also part marketing situation 
they understand market 
they try put nordstrom watsonville kind dirtin fingernails work class town 
and good fit 
also watsonville downtown business move outlying shopping center 
the church watsonville sit sat sat 
they think go rehab first two half year 
and figure costly 
they tear go build replica 
then building watsonville still kind shake 
but tell somebody lose money 
that fundamental problem face reconstruction project 
watsonville santa cruz mixed bag 
you get everything 
get main street program go 
enterprise zone watsonville 
they get new hold company try rearrange ford 
and think might able survive 
recovery happen gradually 
and keep 
watsonville build new building 
they open business 
some new one construction 
and rehabbed 
again lot housing money lot state assistance 
but cost enormous 
this project square foot retrofit 
and go sustain without sort subsidy 
again housing money really support commercial project 
give example george hotel santa cruz million project 
sumatomo bank put million 
the rest come source include developer equity 
new health clinic watsonville 
other thing plan come building complete 
streetscape come along santa cruz 
the building right one city council say look like barn 
you determine 
santa cruz bicyclists motorist coexist find get along 
and building rehabilitation get complete 
the george complete 
the architect good thing 
say look 
the building go 
but fortunately do measurement feature 
that tower exact replica tower 
and help community feel well place 
and new streetscape come 
the wall come tumble 
they build build behind wall 
many never really think go happen 
and parking structure santa cruz 
and new art history museum project santa cruz initiate quake 
that go boost 
the context important town 
the streetscape go 
you see building rebuild 
go take year hole get fill 
the last pavilion go 
watsonville earthquake monument kind symbol happen 
immediate background building still limbo 
far background get parking structure new building construction 
saga rebuild long one 
require lot change part everybody 
the government might certain institutional culture 
might gear active economic partner 
political shift go take place 
economics go dictate success long haul 
take time 
think watsonville santa cruz make real good progress still long way 
question audience watt ron watt municipality anchorage building safety 
how handle process build permit application 
normally anywhere day week month time consume operation particularly residential building need rehab rebuild 
eadie well several different thing 
first give high priority downtown rebuild project go hired structural engineer 
the city enact new building code earthquakes close door horse get 
really required structural engineering review thing 
there expedite procedure 
brought lot extra inspector state mutual assistance initial period everybody town want chimney inspect 
come form pass everybody rebuild chimney 
but take shortcut 
and know take time 
prepare for disaster and economic recovery alaska robert gray president national bank alaska anchorage alaska when talk prepare disaster economic recovery remember kind disaster earthquake 
you split business cope individual cope 
miss anchorage earthquake miss fairbanks flood 
that big disaster state 
industry huge fire minneapolis destroy headquarters large bank northern tier united state credit file 
originally iowa saw tornado personally 
united state example hurricane florida also one hawaii 
alaska anchorage start see volcano 
spurr irritate 
but want know bad get pull national geographic see 
katmai eruption kodiak 
unbelievable make happen anchorage earthquake look minor comparison 
that could happen day 
all happen one volcano west big wind right direction 
remember damage anchorage earthquake big damage tsunami 
the ground shake lot damage anchorage 
but really frightening see happen kodiak seward valdez 
many type disaster 
and business consumer need contingency planning 
expert bank industry federal regulator force contingency planning law 
national bank alaska quite awhile 
one area sensitive computer area 
bank run well without computer anymore 
and forced law third party backup computer file 
know whether discussed conference business absolutely computer operate airline would excellent example need backup 
after make mind go way pretty expensive set third party backup one 
there sense locate anchorage kind disaster hit computer center would hit backup system 
you test backup system 
reciprocal arrangement backup somebody els make feel good sign document test believe worth paper write 
and test least annually 
the reason change computer system time 
and need keep 
switch gear little bit like talk economic consequence disaster 
banking industry course get directly involve economic consequence 
the prior speaker make several reference bank 
and right 
private industry 
role play 
immediate economic consequence long term one 
think talk immediate one first 
the first one immediately cash economy 
nobody interested credit card 
and much interested check 
when research happen anchorage earthquake course big problem airport damage 
airport damage way understand problem get thing like cash 
people realize bank industry alaska particular state net user cash 
bring cash state go somewhere els 
one big reason fishing industry 
they huge user cash 
not every state way 
there user supplier 
tends balance 
but alaska big user 
and get frequent shipment cash lot security federal reserve 
and stop economic consequence relatively severe 
the mere fact cash check becomes severe problem 
why problem 
because computer work right know people money account 
you talk california 
you back little history san francisco earthquake realize problem bank 
they cash 
they get 
the reason get shift ground change building vault door seize open 
that something think 
but heavy door 
and delicately balance 
you drop one side inch leave side open 
give example 
and notice people municipality hit little close home 
payroll area many state federal employee receive pay electronically 
that work computer work 
that work computer link low 
even computer work fine communication system dish satellite whatever hook low get get transmission 
none social security people would get money direct deposit 
what try emphasize cash economy 
now research happen anchorage 
there terrific sense cooperation community happen 
and think probably santa cruz people try pull together 
but everything much manual 
when everything computerize go make little tough 
but basically merchant give credit large extent much cash 
another thing happen immediately large loan demand 
that surprise 
and mention previously 
that put strain banking system 
staff office kind demand 
and obviously work long hour 
but still everything kind slows 
there another economic consequence happens say immediately close immediately people think 
there extreme boost economic activity 
saw alaska exxon valdez oil spill 
and something anybody want create lot economic activity quickly alaska 
saw bank 
the whole state economy shift 
prince william sound 
saw much anchorage even state 
kind thing happen immediately need planning 
plan bank shortage cash 
plan computer availability 
contingency plan staff 
know go fly low run computer system back 
phone number 
they know call periodically 
and something happens immediate flight provide get airplane low work system help economy 
this would unpleasant scenario lot confidence alaska could pull wherever happen alaska 
this anchorage problem 
say fairbanks significant problem 
the hard part long term problem 
but solution 
the important part sure discuss conference need talk think solution rather disaster strike 
because time anything 
you time plan 
business personal level immediate long term problem massive destruction property 
mean obvious show picture happen santa cruz 
see picture earthquake 
maybe experience 
one thing federal government good small business administration come immediately make large amount fund available low interest rate banking community 
the interest rate remember right percent 
and many loan 
make countless loan kodiak anchorage seward state 
and interestingly enough almost default 
the people pay back 
and work really well 
and people think solution 
well really 
like previous speaker say cost structure change 
here change 
let say person business get loan building 
and building destroyed earthquake 
the government say well give low interest rate loan pay back 
and take million rebuild hypothetically probably far 
well still get loan pay also 
get old loan pay million new loan real low interest rate still pay principal 
instead debt million debt 
and good ability functionally 
and interruption business 
the point try make business need insure much 
there several type insurance 
and course relation think risk affordable 
and area earthquake insurance good afford 
real important type insurance people think business interruption insurance 
because period time nothing come 
you insure 
course individual issue home 
previous conference 
but sure bring earthquake risk anchorage certainly homogenous 
and price way either 
area town pretty hard afford earthquake insurance 
but town afford 
another thing like talk updating insurance 
insurance solves problem sba solve take old debt 
but still expensive new building 
use million example really want loan pay another extra put toward new one 
that really need 
need update insurance build worth much insure need replacement cost 
people seem think replacement cost 
they think well old build worth much 
well produce cash flow 
and new building nice may may produce cash flow 
basis look 
the previous gentleman really enjoyed talk say need percent business downtown santa cruz 
well business go come 
you get population 
you get payroll 
people sudden go start drive san francisco shop santa cruz need business santa cruz 
the classic result shrinkage number business 
and think probably banker talk talk viable business 
and really want 
insurance salesman 
want people think 
but insurance vital part plan individual business make 
and think conference could publicize 
because lot plan city go federal government go 
you need recommend solution individual business individual consumer go 
because town prosper unless individual prosper 
that pretty well cover prepared remark 
want leave enough time question 
question comment audience combellick rod combellick alaska geological survey 
question economic impact impact disaster economic impact mitigation 
gray litigation 
combellick mitigation 
reduce hazard 
case involve map geologic hazard 
and reaction often face want map geologic hazard map hazard high go reduce property value 
heard story minute ago proposal one local government alaska approve receive federal fund revision flood hazard mapping 
the local assembly vote receive fund want hazard map reduce property value area map high hazard 
well solve kind problem 
gray well guess need talk assembly 
that almost incomprehensible want know truth true situation 
bank require ass 
flood risk real estate loan 
and flood insurance available 
sure price would show flood risk area 
and think talk change map 
combellick that right 
and part problem fear standpoint get loan new construction spot map within area map high hazard risk bank approve loan 
gray well bank would approve loan subject insurance flood insurance 
and flood insurance purchase 
kind area ought flood insurance 
combellick flood one area good success use insurance deal hazard 
there lot hazard 
you get earthquake insurance 
but thing like landslide problem people may difficult time get insurance example make map show area subject landsliding earthquake gray well guess always problem anybody say knowledge bad 
but reaction often get 
gray you know run area talk environmental risk 
run test property find three lot service station 
and problem ground water move 
and know run lot 
that squash lot deal right 
combellick think point real need alaska everybody involve scientific community government plan community business community need start work together dissolve myth 
gray well think absolutely right 
guess argument 
head roger head alaska department transportation public facility 
rely bank industry regulate number requirement might otherwise get require code review order lend 
see banking industry move direction toward require kind insurance advocate 
gray yes 
fact interruption business insurance talk quite often require 
the reason credit risk business check clear payment system business 
and directly relate credit risk form risk impair collect loan 
think big enough risk meaningful would make loan subject risk mitigate insurance 
different agricultural area require hail insurance farm loan common 
hammer mary hammer boulder creek california 
question rebuild subdivision turnagain arm landslide area 
how bank enter 
agreement development area know landslide area probably insurance would cover developer importantly individual homeowner developer sell property 
gray know area talk course 
know would 
you know could give flippant remark 
but basically would much much tough credit quality developer 
that would immediate response 
word primary source repayment risky normal would look source repayment perhaps mitigate 
because zone business 
you know follow law 
but engineer zone business 
credit risk business 
and saw lot risk would do anything specific personally area say hypothetically would look ask lot security area developer 
maybe real estate cash something like 
hammer see 
course problem get situation california developer process 
and homeowner unknowingly know leave 
gray yeah want good citizen follow law 
but basically cover credit risk interval loan 
and although bring good point think developer sell lot finance year loan would impact decision also 
hammer sure 
course look savings loan bailout bailouts get risky loan 
community think whole nation look 
gray that right 
good job analyze risk 
cole that question deal community time 
geotechnical engineer foundation engineer often ask foundation analysis area identify susceptible ground failure earthquake 
and designer engineer warn client problem substantial risk 
the prevalent response well bank loan money think safe 
the city give permit think safe 
there lot people say somebody els decision 
gray right 
cole and like get view first hand bank really get involved 
gray extent impairs credit 
keep say term 
and would check fha fannie mae people like make sure long term financing available area 
that would critical question 
imagine get involve subdivision loan 
but statement pas opportunity say buyer get take responsibility 
you know one buy 
and intelligent buyer 
now need fact 
and like gentleman say pretty tough somebody say want truth 
but conference excellent example 
hope get lot publicity provide information buyer intelligent 
because think best way could happen 
shechter say follow rod say know talk community 
bill shechter fairbanks 
go come say anything trip 
the plan identify area flood plain 
and say problem get flood insurance 
the federal flood insurance program cover ground water flood 
and proven fairbanks many time 
what say banking institution may loan money house unless get flood insurance 
and area establish non flood insurance area ground water problem may potentially interfere bank interaction loan correct 
gray that correct 
want hear 
gray and required check see flood area 
flood area need get flood insurance 
get flood insurance imagine make loan 
shechter could flood area type flood allow get coverage ground water problem 
gray yeah 
you seem knowledgeable area 
kind area would somebody want build 
unidentified voice because great view 
gray see 
all right 
hope real good view 
this page leave blank 
lesson learn from the loma prieta earthquake michael dever plan director county santa cruz santa cruz california go run highlight reel 
one thing want make sure get point degree topic intermingle 
these topic clear distinct entity break apart thing heard 
you need understand work together 
santa cruz planning department little different may use 
lot thing plan department 
build geology erosion control grade plus plan 
get lot involvement natural disaster occur 
and share santa cruz county 
about every two year federally declare disaster sort 
lot practice unfortunately go 
become clear year particularly loma prieta earthquake really two distinct function disaster business response period recovery period 
and talk separately 
when come response think great job plan practice response 
get great emergency response culture entire field response work go 
get first response organization like fire police 
they wonderful job get deal response issue 
little different live field though 
practice much fire police 
and think one thing need take consideration disaster planning 
lot people go involved process rarely although spend lot time disaster plan 
everybody run get red binder 
and people like get red binder year 
and tabletop exercise say ready binder go shelf 
now tell happens particularly earthquake hit 
everything fall bookshelves somebody like say charlie big red binder bookshelf past year 
pick big red binder 
and santa cruz big red binder two volume thick 
base state model multi hazard functional index 
the first thing flip section plan suppose tell everything suppose 
while look phone ring people go crazy 
you try find disaster match the plan 
you find every time 
you take big red binder throw away 
and also happen every time 
one thing want get across may fly ointment want encourage use red binder security blanket 
because do plan necessarily mean go able work plan disaster strike 
tend sort lapse planning disaster planning specifically 
where see thing work well great deal flexibility build plan 
one example planning specifically santa cruz county geologichazards ordinance get seismic safety element general plan 
do disaster do four time 
knew geology area 
the problem loma prieta follow plan 
what tell people seismic safety element geologic review land use process ridge top safer place 
they certainly better lowland fill area 
then discover unique unsettling phenomenon geologist call ridge top shattering 
that bad place 
mean saw house throw foundation saw one house come ground foundation 
saw entire building move foot north 
think time high level measure ground acceleration geologist record bad place 
throw complete tizzy 
because plan 
thing suppose happen certain way 
george happen way 
spent little three year try convince public wait figure happen 
they play game 
the public wait figure science happen 
unfortunate process really start depend upon geologist tell happen 
what happen next time 
what safe 
well geologist really 
and every geologist planet visit 
public meeting tell people ready get back house well really know happen 
really know safe 
but want study thing prove safe back rebuild 
what happen manage cut base support whole field geology 
the bad thing could santa cruz county show public meeting geologist 
because everybody els geologist 
and somebody would ask geologist well safe 
what happen 
the geologist would say well really know 
could take couple year study 
wait rain 
and may may range thing 
the planner would stand say well know 
really think much want depend upon think go happen 
experience work way 
along line precede assumption get turn upside find important good thinker key spot 
you know lot time disaster plan say public work director go road 
and plan director go geology 
and finance director go finance 
everybody go keep discipline 
well problem people well stress 
they well world go hell handbasket 
some people work government well 
some people well time thing like ready fire aim 
you know make decision without know fact 
good example charlie eadie 
this field 
this living earthquake 
turn could use head could get thing do 
big problem find temporary shelter deal federal state housing bureaucracy 
now deal housing bureaucracy know like government unto 
whole world rule regulation normally deal 
well turn assign data process director set emergency housing effort 
and data processing director 
doctorate public administration university southern california eats bureaucracy breakfast 
and within two day sound like grow housing 
and get thing do 
stuck regular model never would happen 
heard number speaker talk psychological impact happens 
want let know something really think response effort people 
our building county building santa cruz five story concrete building 
design shift earthquake 
and expansion joint suppose pop certain amount concrete suppose spall fall 
well engineer know 
building designer know 
building maintenance people know 
secretary planners general people know 
when see thing happen want building 
but center response 
that everybody try respond stuff 
remember charlie say period ground act like john aho jello experiment 
the ground like jello 
move time aftershock 
wear people real quickly 
every time aftershock round staff 
because know hell go 
and aftershock 
loud noise particularly loud deep noise 
assistant director deal afterschocks leave 
people would come work look ceiling crack concrete 
be crack yesterday 
well call engineer 
there crack monitor 
happen drill every day incredible psychological turmoil whether building still safe 
the best thing happen one structural engineer import county think three four start spray painting crack check 
and calmed people lot 
help two graduate student university colorado come one day start take picture 
you people come really know 
and guy take picture crack 
and say boy building 
somebody come get say mike well come evacuate building division 
and say what mean 
who evacuate building division 
go hallway within office stringing ban 
cade tape hazard not enter 
people run around hard hat leave 
say what 
there people lobby try get emergency permit 
these guy say building 
well guy 
turn two grad student university colorado 
they anybody official 
they background go building 
they make comment 
and everybody say that need go 
along line psychological stress may addition physical strain lot people make hard decision kind event 
you get use concept might able make good 
everybody want come fix 
and sometimes get luxury 
sometimes make bad 
you come demolish people home 
you demolish business 
and something need understand get 
that important right kind people kinds slot make kind decision 
really tough 
you need understand get stuff life go hell quite 
and little piece hell 
often happen event fire flood earthquake like mary say toad locust next people look absolute 
earthquake one thing happen quickly people look absolute term house fell 
build code 
why house damage 
think john aho say day something heard guarantee public know code 
the maximum keep structure fall prevent damage 
nobody know 
guarantee nobody public know 
they figure get permit build code inspected county city whoever 
want know damage 
go lawyer see 
quickly go process say well right 
way suppose 
and keep mind building official 
guy hand kind stuff say make work 
find fall get damage depends quality design quality extent engineering quality material quality construction technique quality inspection quality maintenance site specific soil site specific surround geology unique characteristic earthquake combine thing 
easy right 
let show slide talk 
this obviously new piece construction 
get classic soft first story 
these people office say sue blind county happen house 
build code 
pay fee 
go process 
and still damage 
this new house 
this one new house different kind construction 
this thing split right half 
the piece see right pretty much stay intact piece leave go north 
new house total failure 
same house 
these ben lomond boulder creek area 
pretty new house split right half 
this beach coastal bluff 
this house build probably year ago 
nicely design 
the problem sit geologist since call essentially accumulated beach sand build cliff 
about yard house single family dwell demolition one kinds slope 
that cost one house 
think expensive singlefamily demolition fema ever pay 
they happy 
here another shot 
case get structure fine ground leaf 
again back soquel hill area soquel hill foothills sort thing garage collapse 
this somebody garage 
and see basically floor separate connector come right garage 
brand new construction 
hard time one try figure way 
but happen lot mountain area ridge top talk 
shook violently 
from layperson standpoint think would make difference building design build engineer anything 
shake hard enough long enough go fall 
another one split right half 
the ground fail left side picture building go 
and old construction get thing build probably 1940s 
and see post pier foundation leave scene 
time build building code would fine 
and meantime reason tell replace 
although go fail 
now get thing little bit old 
and may survive thing past 
this one 
there lot old building santa cruz mountain 
and saw lot 
the difficulty find thing kind interesting 
lot people live santa cruz mountain want find 
damage assessment try figure post building unsafe occupy lot time vegetation dense drive within foot one house never see 
keep find thing month earthquake 
keep discover house state disrepair never post 
people would come say yeah need permit fix happen 
prove happen 
they get free permit 
include one house sit one ridge shatter 
there picture house earthquake condition 
wish bring 
instant replay 
look exactly picture 
look way demolished 
want show go get lot damage lot different kind construction 
and case really predict kind stuff 
adventure go response period move move recovery 
now recovery get opportunity turn crisis 
heard response period short 
and year lot people even remember 
screw recovery everybody know know long time 
that one way define disaster right 
the difference crisis disaster 
disaster last long time affect people property 
that people remember 
that deal 
now thing think make provisional operating guideline postdisaster period 
the message want get last thing want figure everything fallen 
the land use process general difficult 
you deal people property 
you deal home 
you deal investment future 
that highly charge environment time 
try planning get opportunity calm situation 
make mistake 
try make policy earthquake everybody damage extent 
everybody charge emotion scale 
when start tell somebody well know go long go take figure make real interesting public meeting far mob time 
let talk predisaster land use planning 
this try right 
try develop policy regulation design provide safe commonly acceptable land us reflect circumstance create unpredictable event unpredictable force duration location disruption potential future risk 
easy right 
how much stuff really plan ahead time 
how much want expect disaster follow put together plan 
you give general operate guideline want respond 
but advice make detailed box 
somebody let know 
like talk 
one thing seem unique earthquake see earthquake flood fire hurricane gut wrench deal kind question anytime particularly happen 
you get people displace home 
your community shamble 
there huge issue debate 
there huge amount financial risk 
you talk survival community 
tough make right kind decision context 
go show something appear honolulu newspaper 
this hurricane kauai year 
call help set recovery unit two week storm 
since small let read couple paragraph report national engineering research team say shoddy construction practice weak building code responsible much damage hurricane iniki cause kauai 
the team wonder appear nothing learned devastation cause hurricane eva much weak storm hit kauai year ago 
the report say particular 
concern exception recommendation set forth various engineering report follow hurricane eva adopt 
the report say recommendation implement much wind induced damage could prevent 
after hurricane eva instead require strong building method kauai county council waive building permit emergency repair 
that unique hurricane 
nobody legislator want front constituent say you rebuild life 
you back way thing 
they understand 
damn tough 
encourage try make decision try get concept outline less charged environment 
happen afterwards 
and away get event tougher becomes 
year later forget 
one thing charlie eadie point vision santa cruz process 
and turn pretty successful process 
think charlie would admit pretty try time 
mean argue go call shape table traditional kind thing 
one thing like recommend plan think need get together talk 
what group 
what role go 
what mission 
because afterward try everybody want help 
everybody say happens 
mean community right 
this life 
try make decision ahead time 
another thing cause lot heartache headache determine acceptable risk 
now know geologist tell 
difficult look building permit development permit without concept go accept 
how safe safe 
our people take almost religious belief geology 
cult geologist 
not geologist per people depend upon geologist tell answer 
what need tell people 
tell people engineer magnitude 
tough come black white term 
case struggle month 
what safe go 
and lose credibility entire geologic review process 
mary neighborhood say go talk geology san lorenzo valley mean development get big turnout 
you go lot people 
and go geologist 
get one community mountains little thing happen 
there acre slide house move foot 
public meeting people whole point discussion what landslide 
lose entire discussion want call whether ground movement 
have event need pay attention 
people really concerned 
property value landslide 
these key issue 
could convince usgs geologist geologist landslide happen wind bottom bum creek everything right 
advice please put situation 
you win 
term acceptable risk one thing think important ask advice go take 
from government decisionmaker perspective go technical expertise go scientific background get task decide go happen go happen 
some thing think determine ahead time whether go accept sign offs construction license architect engineer engineering geologist 
say put wet stamp go good enough 
there two violently oppose camp subject 
you building official california say absolutely 
get check 
got make sure do correctly decision responsibility provide health safety 
you get whole camp say wait minute 
these people license professional 
they put professional license line 
why need question great deal 
that resolve yet 
would great thing resolve ahead time 
for people work build code zone regulation willing exempt ahead time 
what kinds thing make determination really important term rebuild community 
question keep ask matter five year maybe important 
matter five year need take good look require 
one thing find particularly loma prieta need determine normal operation go alter suspend terminate postpone 
what happen earthquake happen october 17th shut regular plan zoning process three month figure thing 
and find three month deal influx application work earthquake deal regular business normally go 
what inadvertently expand impact earthquake people damage 
there lot area county fine 
stop everything three month 
now people impact dead water 
the construction industry love 
the people bank loan pay interest construction ready 
contractor business line 
another thing think threshold rebuild requirement 
be go let people put back 
will let put back long use expand footprint percent percent 
when want plan 
when need plan 
when need engineering 
those thing try fly 
and could do well 
advice try thing ahead time 
with earthquake particularly loma prieta earthquake remember upset prevailing wisdom go happen earthquake go overboard term 
determine want look 
area minimal nonevident damage go particular site really see anything indicated potential problem site 
but happen within confines line draw map make geologic hazard assessment geologic study geotechnical report 
and challenge quite bit what basis 
there nothing go 
the ground crack front house 
there number area need think particularly land use 
nonconforming us 
what go 
be go let people build back 
be go say they build back make conforming 
what thing like infrastructure park facility public work facility hazardous material facility 
what go thing 
what go require rebuild 
take look general plan use 
maybe get thing general plan druthers rather kind use place els 
there may preexist us soon somewhere els community 
have think where alternate site put thing 
one thing spend lot time determine could put temporary housing unit 
take week get figure 
meantime watsonville quite people live tent park 
they real happy figure put 
one big lesson learn normal organizational structure government probably inadequate deal event 
particularly think deal normal work deal recovery work 
case come concept call earthquake recovery division handle earthquake repair reconstruction 
set entirely new piece planning department build zone plan check engineering function 
separate entity 
separate staffing separate funding 
and get open open regular business 
time know go work 
turned work pretty well 
fact use model couple jurisdiction 
the city oakland use fire kauai use 
the lesson charlie say depend government everything 
certainly california losing resource 
from hear talk alaska boat 
nice plan 
but everything 
need find local resource maybe resource outside area call certain kind thing 
that get earthquake recovery division set staffed month 
go hired contractor bring people 
from time get ahead time door open take two week 
that build computer people furniture form phone whole thing 
civil service system like way go happen 
go take month get go take month get rid thing finish 
one recommendation since get opportunity call divine redevelopment think element general plan would essentially disasterrecovery plan 
what kinds thing want change certain way 
thing particular concern think mention begin work identify alternate funding source private property owner afford technical study engineering construction might require condition rebuild something start call institutionalize homelessness 
post home unsafe owner insurance would pay demolition property 
get hole ground 
and could rebuild suck insurance money test study 
even come back positively say need 
you engineer foundation 
you get thing 
and say money 
also house 
thanks lot 
particularly people fix income 
really want gut wrench experience somebody look like grandmother cry desk say you ruin 
what suppose 
not fun 
one thing want make sure get across term set act react business differently need think develop financial regulation budget accounting process purchase function use response period 
person work say best 
gentleman run contract earthquake recovery division 
government focus process want place disaster strike rather try reinvent tweak get around ignore normal procedure try move quickly possible help community 
exactly right 
you use regular process 
one thing want leave idea even get political together develop complete package land use field strongly urge emergency ordinance emergency operate plan emergency procedure go use process 
have hip pocket show time city council board supervisor say what go 
what go 
have something 
don take three month figure 
don take year figure 
the last thing want leave concept try make land use policy disaster 
much ahead time 
keep flexible 
keep simple 
try find right people put role 
think life lot easy happens 
question comment audience 
page name bob page geological survey 
one comment make plan respond disaster ought flexible unforeseen dimension part disaster 
however think might leave misimpression 
you suggest large thing happen geologically unanticipated 
think way audience might remember remark 
but think true 
think percent saw expect 
fact quote show first day report talk damage brick structure san lorenzo river 
well exactly saw 
and go san francisco look damage damage occur area map prone liquefaction ground failure 
think regard shatter ridge top phenomenon really highlight earthquake 
earthquake awful lot house build high mountain source right near house high mountain 
sort frontier bit knowledge 
that element new 
but think small fraction happen 
think bottom line geologist could tell ahead time tell ahead time percent happen 
dever right 
and mean give impression large event take place completely unknown unpredictable 
from land use perspective land use policy perspective expect 
and development area study 
find lot unstable site know 
point say depend geologist tell 
point think know everything 
this page leave blank 
lesson learn from the great alaska earthquake mike meehan economic planning development department municipality anchorage anchorage alaska purpose review year recovery anchorage earthquake 
weave comment heard two day situation today whether lesson learn present 
march thing geographically chronologically educationally 
the earthquake anchorage hit area significantly 
government hill school damage extensively 
the bluff behind alaska native hospital collapse 
the fourth avenue area substantial slide 
there slide street area 
and slide turnagain sea area 
this figure give indication occur 
government hill alaska native hospital fourth avenue street turnagain sea 
today school destroy government hill remove park establish particular area 
alaska native hospital area lot significant stabilization do 
and within next couple year new native hospital go build tudor road 
think firm decision day potential reuse either facility vacate do site alaska native hospital relocates 
detail occur anchorage year fourth avenue area street slide area turnagain area 
think significant thing happen area 
possibly leam 
one thing occur year quite recent history lot clarification study go cause earthquake damage might tell future 
immediately follow earthquake task force think title task force nine 
they assess actual condition exist immediately earthquake make determination cause earthquake 
that follow shannon wilson report map area particularly fourth avenue area one affect earthquake 
then study do know locally harding lawson study 
and recently microzonation study do woodward clyde 
the harding lawson study precipitate modification local code ordinance 
example information harding lawson study affect building code 
the recent revision uniform building code take zone category make local adaptation 
area zone additional step study build permit issue 
this principally do define specifically area hazard concern 
the thing exist classified area susceptible seismic induce ground failure 
this particular study do relationship central business district plan develop back 
then attempt make believe identify area seismic concern 
all basically point attempt continue basis clearly define happens cause certain thing happen 
now information remain concern lot people 
downtown buttress immediately earthquake downtown urban renewal project establish fourth avenue buttress area 
that known urban renewal project 
within particular urban renewal plan plan make relative land use 
where would commercial development would public us allow change anticipate 
generally speak year area show commercial development redevelop commercial purpose 
the blue area today basically park lot within particular area 
and substantial development least date area area ship creek area 
right next year go lot consideration redevelopment activity ship creek area 
meeting last couple day developer area architect 
they make extremely aware zone hazard designation step go work build official get build permit area ship creek 
again back immediately follow earthquake urban renewal plan develop lay specific objective 
want clear land stabilize buttress construction 
much area identify parking lot slop area low land ship creek area part stabilization 
there removal substandard damage building 
make land available commercial use 
redevelop area insure safety 
develop coordination portion central business district provide right way highway project 
those immediate concern come urban renewal plan 
and think do probably 
the fourth avenue area slide area anchorage deliberately stabilize area urban renewal plan accept carry 
think seven slide area one receive specific redevelopment planning actually carry 
why stabilization undertaken fourth avenue slide area nothing do stabilize slide 
report do believe summarize land use planning earthquake use anchorage situation example 
but report state major reason probably relatively high value property stabilize 
fund insufficient stabilize slide area seven talk 
and anchorage correct problem fund could obtain federal source 
but community absorb lot federal fund available 
another factor undoubtedly much land need achieve stabilization fourth avenue area belong federal government 
part federally own operated alaska railroad 
third reason desire maintain pre earthquake location central business district 
why redevelopment project limit area need stabilization 
under redevelopment proposal property owner project area pay postearthquake value property 
this much low well imagine value immediately earthquake 
and consider inadequate compensation affect 
want urban renewal area negatively affect value property 
postdisaster situation desire return quickly normal appear exceeded desire take advantage opportunity achieve objective directly relate reconstruction 
think prior speaker indicate type thinking go today 
with many building destroy near downtown within downtown area little support tear building still stand still stable name urban renewal 
and federal scene federal reconstruction commission charge urban renewal reluctant recommend funding urban renewal project extend beyond area destruction achieve objective recovery 
generally speak give picture happen happen fourth avenue area immediately north downtown 
street next example happen street slide area 
first street slide block slide cause failure saturate sand silt clay bootlegger cove formation 
substantial portion anchorage underlain bootlegger cove clay 
what tend happen understand situation building may remain intact go find depend far sliding 
still lot circumstance potentially relate exactly situation 
the reconstruction task force recommendation follow street slide area 
there substantial recommendation relate maintain low density single family residential development along street 
retains high risk classification today 
but zone change believe year earthquake 
the zone change increase density increase single family dwell us permit multifamily dwell us change portion area allow multifamily office building construction street area 
for anchorage area familiar type situation redevelop street slide area 
today find interesting zone issue come street two basic controversy 
neither one relate 
hazard area talk 
but generally speak someone already build location concern number one preserving view across inlet 
and get upset multistory structure go block view 
secondly traffic congestion real concern area 
and interesting people concerned access traffic congestion today grant limited roadway access area another earthquake occur affect area block roadways access go compound even 
get emergency vehicle area substantial problem 
what reason street develop way 
property owner street area wish abandon structure undamaged easily repair 
again compensation postdisaster value sufficient induce relocate 
owner begin repairs private fund almost immediately earthquake 
and city apparently felt could afford neither stabilization slide purchase property slide 
fund even allocate undertake economic study stabilization 
generally speak much action government relative area 
and apparently private interest able achieve financing allow start reconstruction almost within year 
like show slide typify go street area 
this slide show actually exist prior 
this one indicate construction go 
solid black dot see quite flurry activity occur 
then significant thing new construction go period time substantially high density high value anything existed area prior earthquake 
turnagain sea the last example go show one mention question person audience one previous presentation 
the question what anchorage reaction tumagain sea area 
for familiar earthquake park area 
and subdivision area pretty controversial quite year 
and interesting catch history earthquake mean term concern redevelopment 
but tremendous flurry activity era 
number emergency ordinance go effect substantial pressure redevelop portion tumagain arm slide area 
the first emergency ordinance identify fact potential hazard public safety require study rational planning future development issue building permit without development plan may threaten public safety 
believe 208th ordinance address issue rapidly follow ordinance 
they require formation improvement district element standard subdivision require formation park district require formation regional park 
place day moratorium development 
again tremendous pressure development private sector period time 
that follow number month later ordinance assembly committee report 
there whole series committee activity go many coordinate lidia selkregg assembly time arliss sturgulewski get involved process 
one thing happen formation geotechnical advisory committee mayor assembly address development geotechnically hazardous area 
there extension moratorium march 
and require specific geotechnical study do slide area 
that move 
there ordinance allow development pave street curbs gutter public water public sewer utility street name sign street light 
but required certification public work director could occur 
the next thing happen concerted push redevelop area tumagain sea subdivision 
tumagain northeast subdivision property owner form road improvement district water improvement district 
one reason do neither federal government state government willing support financially infrastructure improvement area 
local ordinance say go assume private risk develop go form improvement district 
subdivision plat require identify right way location slide 
again area substantial movement ground 
the whole area replatted 
and plat authority approve plat may 
that particular plat file 
that follow legal opinion find municipality would likely hold liable future hazard would occur area develop 
new plat present platting authority 
the plat authority base advice recommendation geotechnical commission reject plat 
that appeal municipal assembly 
and assembly sit board adjustment approve plat 
the plat record may 
that appeal court court overturn assembly action 
you see quite flurry action area 
and always clear development occur 
mayor direct plat authority hold new hearing 
the plat approve june although file 
geotechnical study do shannon wilson march 
and finally new plat approve file 
that merely give brief history flurry activity occur tumagain area 
the controversy continue today 
think people public work could give much date picture 
part hassle concern exist today form road improvement district lateral improvement district water improvement district assessment allocation cost property owner become question 
how do 
there people closer proximity slide 
there away slide feel treat differently 
and believe even year subject go assembly resolution 
summary that give quick overview happen three geographic area year 
and lesson think learn locally go 
downtown area series public facility concern come 
one location design state courthouse possible location state office building 
there potential new state office building location study do number year ago 
pretrial detention facility sit build within immediate area fourth avenue slide area 
generally speak technical information assemble geotechnical information closely adhere make public facility site study decision design public facility within geotechnically hazardous area 
people tend view public project differently private development 
this particularly true elect official 
there differ view concern public risk versus private risk 
spoken number elect official people within administration feel private sector ought allow gamble take risk build geotechnically hazardous area get finance make 
think long run extremely hazardous expensive future 
may force private sector build road improvement utility improvement construct original infrastructure 
but advice get another earthquake go occur when occurs 
the point raise be go redevelopment expense associate particular geographic area street tumagain area 
how local official go face redevelopment subject come 
be go rebuild public expense infrastructure damage 
that almost second stage 
the first stage go occur expense go incurred emergency recovery mobilization assist people affect area 
go long haul public expenditure area people tend say let private sector take risk 
hand public risk involve seem great deal caution exercise 
want make sure sit public facility adhere advice technical information best exemplify sit design courthouse sit potential new state office building sit construction design pretrial detention facility 
also go similar exercise past year half potential site new municipal office building 
least dialogue occur indicated local elect official cognizant fact sit public facility pay lot attention risk factor deal private construction private finance facility 
try provide overview three four different geographic area occur time 
and maybe comment gain particular insight might learn 
jump complete conclusion say result 
learn anchorage 
but one thing impress impressed depress last two day observe audience 
least two day session attend yet see one local elect official participate listen information present 
know get people attend ultimately make decision allow development occur hazardous area 
think technical people do excellent job year best maintain build code fire code thing nature anticipate best condition exist anchorage 
experience within plan department somewhat distress 
you hear information last couple day geotechnical hazard liquefaction subsidence sort thing 
but much simpler one 
early 1980s map potentially hazardous avalanche area within anchorage 
and map basically intend inform general public hazardous area information purpose consider plan zone commission plat board whenever development propose area 
during last two year severely criticize people live area land area 
someone mention earlier afternoon question 
get criticize mapping flood hazardous area 
well criticize mapping avalanche hazard area 
personally attended number avalanche seminar 
one thing learn seminar avoid real hazard avalanche stay area 
yet continue cry community number people allow private sector develop avalanche chute 
hold seminar strictly avalanche hazard late last winter 
that seminar hold response people want force remove public counter avalanche hazard map one could see information lending institution direct access 
consider make loan area information jeopardize individual chance get financing 
well fortunately friday saturday sunday work session avalanche consult number expert avalanche send many invitation people affect area complain concern 
after three day strongly get indication awareness create genuine potential risk 
strictly try regulate take away private enterprise private opportunity make money 
but try protect life warn people particular area 
heard within past six nine month additional cry remove public counter information avalanche hazard area 
last awhile 
but sure sooner later type controversy go rise 
and subject almost cruel inhumane punishment 
get accuse bad news bear make information available 
the true information geotechnical hazard avalanche area flood plain area 
guess maybe one thing planner subject 
really want know define hazardous area planner position 
the mayor day complain felt overweight 
and say your honor planner year 
community year 
get short get hammer around head shoulder
