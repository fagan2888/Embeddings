geologic investigation american republic geology the mapped area consist essentially mesas carve extensive flow rhyolite 
the structure rhyolite reflect influerree underlie dome latite around rhyolite flow 
the quicksilver ore localize top latite dome 
these volcanic rock probably rest underlie basement jurassic cretaceous limestone 
geomorphology study interpretation geomorphology area essential two respect 
the geomorphology play important part interpretation structure rhyolite afford mean scientific prospect ore deposit bury elsewhere beneath similar rock condition quicksilver ore deposited 
the land form geomorphic history map area cannot fully interpret without detailed mapping study much wide area conclusion tentatively present basis observe evidence 
the geomorphic development area bring largely strea1ns control primarily structure flow layer rhyolite 
the flow layer rhyolite rarely horizontal place vertical contort anticlines synclines 
although term strict sense refer convex upward concave upward fold sedimentary rock induce deformation rock med use lack well term refer similarly disposed structure form still plastic lava result flow movement lavas become consolidated 
the major stream part initiate place flow layer horizontal vicinity travesafio progress headward along synclines rhyolite 
this headward development particularly well show arroyo canoas tributary northern part map area flow mesa carmona mesa del lobo also headwaters arroyo los mimbres 
the flow layer rhyolite part relate form underlie dome latite stream pattern likewise part indirectly relate domal structure 
the headward progress arroyo canoas follow general strike flow layer take advantage synclinal depression northeastward dip flow layer rhyolite conform northeast slope latite dome southwestward dip flow layer rhyolite mesa del lobo 
quicksilver deposit canoas mexico 
the history arroyo los mimbres appear complex 
originate tributary arroyo canoas initiate horizontal flow layering travesafio 
it headward progress accelerate northerly dip flow laver rhyolite slop north side latite dome 
when cut deeply enough reach easily erodible latite beneath rhyolite progress headward rapidly capture arroyo del palmar probably headwater arroyo los colorado 
this unusual localization major stream alorig synclines interpret mean stream superpose consequent upon initial surface never bury cover younger rock also drainage still early stage development 
although major stream localize along synclines rhyolite tributary adjust structure flow layer 
place second order tributary adjust zone locally intense crenulation stream plunge southern escarpment place flow layer vertical 
many third order tributary adjust low anticlines whose limb dip 
segment stream control joint 
these joint appear merely local effect cause individual small bend streams influence stream development entirely subordinate importance structure flow layer rhyolite 
many place mesas bound steep cliff high 
because impose aspect assume predominance one visual impression region actually less half periphery mesa bound cliff 
many place side mesas steep bouldery slope place dip slope conform flow layer rhyolite 
rid valley one see rhyolite best cliff conspicuous 
cliff develop flow layering horizontal casual observer might mislead think mesa carve horizontally layer rhyolite 
place however flow layer horizontal 
even steeply incline within edge cliff flow layer swing horizontal brink cliff 
several factor appear involve limiting development cliff place flow layer horizontal 
the rhyolite disintegrate spall flake parallel flow layer thus develop plane surface 
where surface incline loosened fragment readily wash away rain water 
geologic investigation american republic easily enter upturned therefore exposed fracture parallel flow layering 
where surface horizontal rain water flow slowly across less easily enter horizontal fracture plane 
therefore flow layer horizontal rhyolite resistant erosion flow layering inclined stand cliff 
rain water readily attack horizontal rock cliff along vertical joint hence crude joint column cliff accentuate erosion picturesque column spire 
slight inward dip flow layer mesa aid formation column spires place concentration rain wash originally little synclinal structure parallel cliff face develop deep chasm wide separate cliff mesa 
the three principal mesa mass less flat top less covered thin mantle soil 
the surface mesa carmona flat car drive easily road region 
three mesas mesa canoas irregular upper surface 
high southern end become low narrower dissect northward toward terminus travesafio 
the surface eastern mesa name palomas concepcion lobo intermediate flatness mesa carmona hilliness mesa canoas 
the flat surface mesa carmona truncates contort structure flow layer rhyolite 
this truncation true also top mesa less marked degree 
vesicular lava indicative tcp flow absent mesa 
evidently top 1nesas subject erosion planation 
the blocky vesicular character top rhyolite probably allow quickly weather easily remove erosion 
however extent planation amount rock remove probably small already state localization principal stream along synclines indicate drainage consequent upon initial surface geomorphic development still early stage 
thus study geomorphology reveals rhyolite nearly pristine state region overlain young rock structure rhyolite cannot judge assurance view disposition cliff ore must deposit shallow depth near surface

wherever perlite occurs top latite whether high low flank dome essentially uniform thickness
