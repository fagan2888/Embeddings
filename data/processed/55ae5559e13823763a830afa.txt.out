discussion the clinton medina tuscarora basin center gas accumulation appear differ significantly classic cretaceous low tertiary example canadian rocky mountains great plain master law dickinson spencer 
important difference wide transition zone occur clinton medina tuscarora basin center gas bearing part accumulation updip discrete oil gas bearing part accumulation 
characteristic broad transition zone low modest water brine productivity wide zone oil bearing stratum ohio northwestern pennsylvania general absence hydrocarbon water contact continuous network adjoin oil gas field 
this zone transition wide accompany field coalesce degree entire regional accumulation could interpret continuous type accumulation 
one reason wide transition zone lack abrupt regionally extensive deposit diagenetic facies change clinton medina sandstone reservoir 
the sandstone body constitute reservoir highly lenticular complexly intertongued similar property porosity permeability across broad region 
general trend eastward diminish porosity permeability note across regional accumulation rate change gradual thus well defined boundary exists discrete basin center part 
second reason wide transition zone regional accumulation substantially modify original basin center configuration 
among probable post generation emplacement modification regional accumulation uplift erosion migration slow leakage constituent hydrocarbon mix several type brine

because high degree modification one perhaps also think paleo configuration well present day configuration classify accumulation whole 
understand ofthe paleo configuration ofthe accumulation would require reconstruction zone retreat determine maximum updip extent ofthe original basin center gas 
however practical approach classify low silurian regional accumulation component particularly resource assessment purpose work within present day framework establish davis zagorski ryder 
tentative classification scheme incorporate contribution show figure 
this classification recognize three part ofthe regional accumulation eastern basin center part western quasi discrete part wide central hybrid part 
this classification imperfect subtle difference three component incorporate factor relevant understanding accumulation origin well recoverable energy resource 
other historical location purpose term field meaningless assessment unit regional accumulation 
practice designate field within regional accumulation production sweet spot high eurs per well 
because lenticular intertonguing nature sandstone reservoir well surround sweet spot also gas oil productive characteristically low eurs per well 
development exploration drill around give sweet spot regional accumulation gradually evolve elaborate hydrocarbon mosaic whose constituent part differ ultimate production capability 
this important characteristic ofthe lower silurian regional accumulation must consider assess potential remain recoverable gas oil resource
