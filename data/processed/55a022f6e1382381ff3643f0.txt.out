the uppermost tertiary unit thirsty canyon tuff fig

the trail ridge member would yield almost age noble christiansen 
because tertiary unit include trail ridge hydrothermally alter least locally cuprite district alteration must take place recently

silicified rock occur scattered patch opalite also form large irregular patch extend middle south end area fig 
only five sample silicified rock examine petrographically far contain abundant hydrothermal quartz calcite 
the calcite may late hydrothermal posthydrothermal product replace former opal

opalite recognize field waxy luster freshly broken surface low porosity

five argil sample examine petrographically 
primary quartz sanidine phenocrysts unaltered whereas biotite partly bleach pale brown plagioclase alter kaolinite glass alter opal varying amount montmorillonite kaolinite 
all five sample contain large amount clay percent opalite sample 
the argil rock contain either kaolinite montmorillonite whereas opalite clay mineral kaolinite 
argil rock contain kaolinite clay mineral thus differ opalized rock relict sanidine less opal clay

for preliminary investigation choose five band incorporate three ratio follow van van band designate approximate center various scanner channel see table 
the first ratio choose delineate alter rock high reflectance near relative owe presence hydroxyl bearing mineral 
the second ratio select display variation surflcial ferric iron content high ratio value indicate high concentration low value indicate low concentration 
the third ratio choose distinguish rock moderately slop spectra include playa tuff basalt bleach iron deficient alter rock fig

comparison geologic map fig 
crc image derive channel scanner data fig 
indicates properly interpret crc image reveals major alter unaltered rock unit 
with field information identify different unit possible produce alteration map quickly accurately 
the silicified rock site appear dark red brown locally bluish purple blue image indicate three ratio similar slight dominance ratio ratio 
this consistent mineralogy field spectra fig 
green low moderate whereas generally moderate variable 
opalites range color mag enta red yellow 
all large amount hydroxyl bear mineral result strong red component image 
the variation color due vary ferric mineral content 
where ferric iron lack highly leach opalites site ratio 
moderately high low result significant blue contribution add red produce magenta color see area fig 
limonite content increase slope spectral curve increase result high value low value 
image produce first red site yellow site green component increase blue component decrease 
the argil rock sit west edge area predominantly yellow green reflect concentration hydroxyl bear ferric mineral 
where argil rock appear green partially cover unaltered rock debris 
this cause reduction ratio hence less red contribution image 
unaltered volcanic rock surficial material dominantly dark green blue almost black crc image therefore readily distinguishable altered rock 
much unaltered thirsty canyon tuff appear nearly black image three ratio relatively low produce dark gray tone black andwhite film transparency ratio thus black dark cblprs crc image 
subtle variation small amount hematite present must determine whether ratio ratio relatively great produce dark green dark blue respectively 
presumably dark blue area less hematite 
the lack hydroxyl bearing mineral account absence red component 
much alluvium scene playa little limonite percent blue 
exception unaltered glassy basal nonwelded tuff spearhead member site 
green crc look similar argil rock 
the spectrum fig 
fact similar argil rock reflectance increase strong maximum 
the ferric iron band weak argil rock due small amount fine grain hematite possibly goethite 
the rock mainly pumice fragment glass shard interstitial glass dust sanidine crystal 
the glass fresh devitrification clay mineral alteration product visible thin section detectable ray diffraction 
the lack clay alteration result small ratio thus less red component crc case argil rock locally yellow crc owe great red component 
indeed argil rock might appear entirely yellow unaltered rock debris partly cover zone mention

this study show additional spectral information provide practical mean largely remove limitation region include absorption feature produce one several important alteration mineral 
include clay dioctahedral mica pyrophyllite alunite 
multispectral data obtain aircraft entire spectral region provide many possibility create useful enhanced image 
although image present probably improve upon contains enough information discriminate among zone within altered area cuprite well discriminate alter unaltered rock 
the rock type remain problematical dark color dense quartz rich silicified altered rock unaltered limonitic shale 
the former confuse chert orthoquartzite latter confuse limonitic argil altered rock 
since ambiguous situation arise rock question identical mineralogically recognition depend large part field observation textural feature recognition remote technique inherently limit
