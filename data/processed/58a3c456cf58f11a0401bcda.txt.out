detailed analysis use whole genome sequence show animal bhlh could classiﬁed several small subfamily highly conserve across major metazoan lineage ledent vervoort simionato 
phylogenetic analysis indicate subfamily present common ancestor bilaterians think exist sometime million year ago simionato

envisage two major alternative hypothesis would explain early radiation bhlh proteins plant 
the ﬁrst radiation occur parallel evolution multicellular transition plant terrestrial environment 
the increase number cell type morphological complexity bring multicellular would program increasingly elaborate gene regulatory network 
bhlh proteins ability heterodimerize differentially control gene expression might become ideal tool assemble complex regulatory pathway

second hypothesis diversiﬁcation plant bhlh protein accompany colonization land 
the challenge face plant dry terrestrial environment lead evolution many novel structure physiological mechanism orchestrate versatile gene regulatory network 
distinguish alternative require knowledge number bhlh protein encode genome multicellular algae 
the sequence charophycean multicellular aquatic algae sister group land plant genome would allow test hypothesis unfortunately handful express sequence tag currently available 
all sequence genome chlorophyte red algae encode bhlh protein

this association also occur independently animal 
second lineage chlorophyte proteins similar subfamily bhlh subfamily although support monophyly poor 
third lineage distinct plant bhlh proteins possibly evolve chlorophyte 
the bhlh protein find red algae could clearly allocate clade
