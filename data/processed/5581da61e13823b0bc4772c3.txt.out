however find olivellites two locality despite nearly week field observation make schindel yochelson schindel 
because many delta front sheet sand rework marine sand body bear trace fossil kind often abundance must conclude either olivellites rarely preserve animal responsible rare environment

discussion observation trace movement form live gastropod olivella iplicata sowerby sup 
ply fenton fenton ready interpretation apparently generic name olivellites 
although use modem analog interpretation fossil organism long tradition skeptical application

fenton fenton 1937c noted elkhorn slough area monterey bay biplicata feed beneath sand leave contort gently convex elevation sharp ridge center indistinct transverse wrinkle 
the convex elevation emphasis add produce shell whole central ridge long siphon extend upward water 
the transverse wrinkle concave forward appear result side side movement shell 
the point could determine dig since water obscure mark loose sand disturb appeared wrinkle must represent series 
yochelson and schindel 
irregular vertical layer sediment push behind move snail 
macginitie macginitie study area year clearly differentiate deeply infaunal gastropod polinices arid olivetta burrow beneath surface 
olivella proceed sand leave depression emphasis add behind make trail 
when congregate breeding season sand sandy mud may sometimes maze tortuous line track leave animal 
thus two report trace leave olivetta conflict fenton fenton 1937c described trace elevation indistinct transverse wrinkle whereas macginitie macginitie report trace featureless depression 
the concave sand layer form transverse wrinkle surface plumtneri fig 
best interpret work animal pile sediment behind make forward progress substrate 
interpretation layer anteriorly concave agreement original description fenton fenton 1937c 
epifaunal snail make forward progress along surface foot plow sediment front foot displaces side produce two lateral ridge separate groove whose width match width foot 
olivetta move surface seem displace sediment around shell deep infaunal gastropod polinices move sediment shell well around macginitie macginitie linsley unpub 
none animal pass sand beneath foot produce anteriorly concave sand layer present olivellites 
two season extensive field work north central texas examination extensive collection geological survey national museum natural history reveal siphon bearing pennsylvanian gastropod compatible olivellites size trace 
thus assertion fenton fenton 1937c medial ridge olivellites form gastropod siphon extend sand water weak best 
this medial ridge would easily interpret siphon trace late mesozoic age siphon snail common diverse 
because pennsylvanian hard press relate particular gastropod 
meekospira peracuta meek worthen smooth exterior surface potentially infaunal gastropod yet bear 
terior notch reflexed apertural lip would indicate presence siphon could long spire make turn tight lectotype plummeri see fig 
low left 
specimen meekospira peracuta wide would least long yet turn radius lectotype plummeriis approximately 
never observe meekospira long large specimen know reach two third length 
the depression leave activity gastropod shallow subtidal zone rarely preserve 
rapidly dry surface fine clay scummy algal mat quickly cover layer mud would make suitable mold cast pair far commonly surface trace destroy wave tide 
our observation trail form live snail convinced fossil representative must exceedingly rare 
general living gastropod find turbulent sand habitat indicate sedimentary feature associate olivellites reason assume paleozoic form live environment 
present day gastropod trail rare shallow subtidal setting exceptional circumstance need preserve 
the path olivellites quite unlike trail live gastropod 
characterize abrupt sharp turn double back 
even sinuous meander olivellites would unlike many gastropod linsley yochelson unpub 
contrast gastropod surface commonly one place another fairly straight line turn make gradual curvature 
large siphon form busycon move shell side side test inhalant water reach siphon foot upon shell rest move forward essentially straight path 
suspect anteriorly concave sand layer olivellites indicate action animal ventral appendage possibly joint modified digging pack sediment behind move forward substrate 
the movement living isopod within sand open beach may produce trace similar olivellites 
the medial ridge might interpret trace within sediment raise dorsal ridge carapace rather trace soft flexible siphon 
the occurrence olivellites upper surface sandstone layer overlie shale mudstone see fig 
suggests alternate reconstruction creator trace 
animal travel sedimentary interface sand mud 
rbexamination olivellites 
passage might preserve underlying layer 
interpretation infaunal animal could fee organic matter within mud yet still make forward progress workable sand 
the medial ridge olivellites would reflect dorsal projection suggest fenton fenton 1937b 
rather would mark ventral space pair paddlelike jointed appendage 
dig appendage move sand beneath behind animal would createanteriorly concave layer separate ridge sediment mark gap ventrally pair appendage 
the trace deposit feeder often turn sharply path plummeri 
upon encounter segment previous path sand mud interface infaunal feeder might pass slightly even wake 
our observation indicate creator plummeri capable exercise two option 
the preservation detail crossing often poor see least two intersection animal cut trace several indicate passage path fig 
see example passage beneath trace suggest interpretation correct olivellites avoided departure sand mud interface 
accord interpretation olivellites would form animal width moderate length 
elongate wormlike animal would expect execute abrupt hairpin turn would pass sediment backward beneath entire length body 
our aim remove olivellites gastropoda reassign 
even though particular pennsylvanian arthropod suggest creator trace feel removal olivellites mollusk open door new investigation possibly lead well understanding pennsylvanian biota

the failure find obligate anaerobe virtual absence iron reducer methanogen bacteria injection well sample surprising 
earlier result show significant population bacteria include obligate anaerobic sulfate reducer develop near injection well post injection period redevolpment 
therefore expect microbial community near well would clearly indicative organic enrichment

chloric acid removal 4x108 water effectively clear region nutrient characteristic organism could develop 
the virtual absence anaerobic organisms well suggest anaerobically assimilable nutrient reach area

the small amount oxygen diffuse well shaft may support small population aerobe find near well 
assume microbial community formation mostly contain adherent film cell find pumped water sample dislodge film entrain water move toward well bore 
assume number cell dislodge proportional total biomass rate dislodgement proportional velocity water move past film 
once entrain movement cell formation impede sorption exclusion effect 
water sample therefore contain large proportion cell microbial community near well bore relative number cell distant community biomass biomass basis 
word microbial community near well screen overrepresented pumped water sample relative distant community 
because complication appear feasible relate cell count biomass shall attempt 
one important assumption make important microbial type formation near well appear pumped water sample 
the significant difference composition microbial flora well therefore suggestive real difference quality ground water point 
cod value table indicate organic enrichment aquifer past well indicate difference among sampled area 
consideration microbial ecology show penetration microbial nutrient confine much short distance 
summary microbial community specie composition similar find anaerobic environment organic matter decompose find near well less extent near well 
community near injection well compose microbial type would expect anaerobic heterotrophic ecosystem
