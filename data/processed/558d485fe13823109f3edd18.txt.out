introduction brief description slide and it current condition begin april continue may year massive landslide occur west side spanish fork canyon 
the landslide locate north site town thistle utah county utah 
the landslide mass long 
there elevation difference canyon floor head 
the landslide move west east slope 
east wall canyon slide thrust steep bluff sandstone result high blockage spanish fork canyon 
the blockage cause disastrous flooding upstream soldier creek thistle creek valley see fig 
high level emergency spillway excavate prevent reservoir water overtop slide mass 
later low level diversion tunnel construct drain reservoir create landslide blockage 
this low level tunnel currently carry river flow 
the flooding cause landslide necessitated relocation highway railroad pass canyon cause direct cost estimate exceed million kalis 
the landslide still block canyon 
above blockage slide debris fill trough shaped tributary valley west side canyon 
currently slide appear stabilize although small movement still take place 
measurement surface displacement indicate downslope movement march august 
piezometric measurement suggest presence high pore pressure within much landslide piezometric level ground surface many location 
the blockage within spanish fork canyon support slide debris tributary valley 
for reason low portion slide subject large lateral thrust 
this thrust produce squeeze action result high lateral pressure act within low portion slide 
drill extremely difficult particularly west side blockage 
drill hole tend squeeze shut high earth pressure drill casing become stuck 
the shape landslide modify somewhat earth move activity 
landslide debris move onto blockage raise crest elevation provide buttress downstream face 
the risk overtop reduce drainage improve stability 
some boring drill explore slide numerous sample obtain observation test 
although provide considerable information condition within slide mass important question remain unanswered 
these question include location alluvium occupy valley bottom slide location continuity railroad ballast highway base course condition along east abutment contact cliff nugget sandstone slide 
these question important bearing seepage slide condition high reservoir potential internal erosion piping blockage

purpose the committee study the main purpose committee study determine whether geotechnical point view would feasible use landslide mass block spanish fork canyon dam flood control irrigation storage recreation power generation 
the committee also charge recommend investigative program develop information need address question 
committee activity the committee meet three time utah course study 
they examine information provide division water right examine map landslide plan exploration field measurement program examine core obtain test boring plan evaluated laboratory test field measurement prepared report 
the result initial review propose exploration program summarize report date april 
addition committee member fleming spend approximately one week mapping slide area

summary main point the mass earth move thistle landslide consist landslide earthflow deposit accumulate tributary valley west spanish fork canyon considerable time perhaps thousand year 
the landslide may move slow rate prior rapid movement occur 
most material landslide silty sandy gravelly clays derived north horn formation 
these material medium plasticity average liquid limit average plasticity index 
silty clayey sand encountered location within slide 
the landslide envelop ballast railroad portion alluvium fill low part canyon slide base course highway 
the deep portion alluvium probably remain place beneath slide mass canyon 
the trigger mechanism landslide believe near record precipitation fall substantial snowmelt spring 
once motion landslide continue move buttress form accumulated slide debris spanish fork canyon debris tributary valley west canyon nearly deplete 
the landslide squeeze sandstone cliff east side canyon portion tend move west 
thus mass spanish fork canyon contain high horizontal earth pressure contribute difficult drilling condition 
the high pressure would seriously affect construction activity within mass 
small movement landslide still occur although major movement stop present 
there appear high pore pressure within mass 
these may may dissipate time 
dissipation would accompany additional settlement horizontal movement 
renew slide appear imminent although could trigger extremely heavy precipitation snowmelt renew surcharge top landsliding high elevation involve event 
surficial slide erosion mass block spanish fork canyon continue possibility 
the landslide debris within spanish fork canyon function dam considerable period lake drain 
base experience committee believe would safe use blockage flood control dam without permanent reservoir water level hold elevation low point highway retention last three month 
the committee believe impoundment high elevation longer period would unsafe 
inspection care outlet facility require whether blockage use flood control purpose allow remain present condition 
incorporate blockage dam irrigation recreation hydropower us would require storage elevation period longer three month would require extensive exploration landslide 
the committee believe exploration could prove inconclusive matter extensive program could reveal deficiency could remedied reasonable cost 
likely reliable multiple use reservoir could develop low cost construct dam upstream blockage rather incorporating blockage dam

geologic evidence current stability the thistle landslide although thistle landslide stop move entity movement readjustment debris appear occur internally

much debris ultimately reach thistle landslide replenish head area deplete debris 
this process likely continue perhaps hundred year condition establish would compare existed landslide 
the large basin near head landslide displace bedrock rib basin head slide see bedrock geology would appear pose serious threat reactivation 
abrupt slide entire basin could produce return pre condition worse 
explanation deep seat sliding could produce offset observe 
seemingly offset bedrock displace later 
possible careful map area couple measure stratigraphic section drilling could resolve issue

number inflow permeability test perform roll in brown gunnel inc interval test boring 
they place four boring blockage canyon location show plate log boring appendix value permeability calculate assume head loss equal difference elevation test interval water level case 
because actual head loss probably small use calculate permeability value actual permeability likely high report value 
seventy percent test test indicate low permeability value result range measurable loss water value permeability less sec 
the remain percent test indicate permeability value range sec sec bore complete loss water case 
void encounter boring open tube piezometer 
the result test thus indicate matrix permeability much landslide fairly low clayey material make slide fairly impermeable 
scatter landslide however zone high permeability material void fissure capable transmit large amount water relatively low gradient 
another important aspect slide mass within spanish fork canyon existence high horizontal earth pressure within mass 
indication existence high earth pressure come difficulty experience drilling 
boreholes tend squeeze shut quickly drill casing bind tightly squeeze ground 
these high earth pressure important several respect first excavation within slide may initiate slide quickly material squeeze excavation 
second structure build within appurtenant landslide would subject high earth pressure load 
third pore pressure within landslide dissipate consolidation may result lateral movement well settlement 
furthermore high horizontal stress may significant influence stability blockage respect slide upstream downstream 
high horizontal pressure common geotechnical profession limit experience 
thus difficult anticipate possible effect upstream downstream slide movement 
hydrologic consideration lake level and discharge rate the use blockage spanish fork canyon dam require consideration seepage blockage potential internal erosion piping 
the possibility internal erosion pip depends grain size composition distribution high permeability lowpermeability material within slide mass 
these characteristic largely unknown 
the possibility internal erosion also depend depth water pond behind blockage length time water would retain

one piezometer near upstream edge blockage see plate observe fall reservoir suggest relatively direct connection reservoir bury gravelly alluvium piezometer tip complete 
this temporary service dam indicate blockage could retain water high level longer day

groundwater condition piezometer place eight nine drill hole site complete 
measurement pressure head make drill hole complete nine interval december august 
the individual water pressure reading show table appendix data plot figure appendix the result plot term equivalent piezometric level relative ground surface depth 
plot hydrostatic pressure distribution would indicate vertical line 
the result appear indicate fluid pressure within slide mass relatively high 
the piezometric level frequently approach exceed level ground surface middle low portion slide mass 
there appear pronounced decrease fluid pressure directly failure surface majority drill hole locate within spanish fork canyon high landslide 
however drill hole locate upper portion slide evidence decline fluid pressure observe 
exceptionally high fluid pressure record depth fluid pressure measure approximately ground surface 
the standpipe piezometer complete depth bore see plate observe flowing september 
these indication high fluid pressure occur near key area bend constriction bend see boring log 
high fluid pressure would significant stability slide 
unfortunate measurement piezometer instal must consider somewhat doubtful perhaps unreliable 
this pressure response test could perform check operation pneumatic transducer instal 
there reason question piezometric data 
these include remarkable constancy piezometric reading period february august 
this period include spring snowmelt follow relatively dry summer 
piezometer place landslide similar situation climate topography typically show significant seasonal fluctuation piezometric level 
change would expect thistle slide 
however three piezometer show change two show significant fluctuation march august 
only six piezometer show fluctuation february august 
three piezometer exhibit indication unreliable behavior 
remainder none show variation pressure head march august 
twenty two piezometer show maximum variation february august 
the non zero change sufficiently small piezometer 
could possibly inoperative 
while possible piezometer locate within uniform zone low permeability relatively isolated seasonal effect location behavior seem unlikely many piezometer result measurement therefore somewhat suspect 
exceptionally high fluid pressure associate exceptionally heavy precipitation event describe later report simple obvious explanation timing slide 
however piezometer measurement appear support hypothesis show significant evidence even modest seasonal fluctuation 
therefore either hypothesis incorrect piezometric data incorrect perhaps mislead 
alternate explanation fluid pressure measure slide bear little relationship present slide trigger 
therefore pressure fluctuation measure could quite different april 
since possible subject piezometer field quality control test seem reasonable challenge hypothesis basis available piezometric data 
most water level piezometer place four drill hole see figure appendix piezometer instal three state drill hole complete see figure appendix available committee 
however result standpipe piezometer place bottom record several week october 
data cover period lake level decline 
this piezometer complete deep gravel channel locate blockage probably general level alluvium cover spanish fork valley floor 
the water level piezometer decline relatively directly decline level reservoir 
this drill hole locate top blockage one third distance upstream toe slide downstream toe see plate 
the head loss record piezometer vary one half maximum head difference reservoir level minus stream level downstream slide initial reading two third maximum head difference final reading take 
the change response suggest either increase permeability occur downstream october decrease permeability occur upstream period 
few groundwater data available bedrock alluvium toe slide 
however data available confirm spanish fork valley serve regional groundwater discharge 
there numerous occurrence warm hot water spring well along valley floor vicinity slide well warm water encounter construction low level diversion tunnel slide lake 
the temperature water vary these data summarize figure appendix prepare case utah geological mineral survey table appendix prepared state division water right dwr 
the warm water spring near figure report atwood adjacent small temporary pond approximately elevation leave flank slide could also significant element hydrogeology slide 
well drill one quarter mile downstream slide encounter gpm warm sulfurous water depth depth water come white sandstone 
report groundwater shallow well deep dug townsite thistle indicated water alluvium 
the log deeper bedrock well drill thistle show gravel small flow gpm water depth 
these data suggest normal temperature near surface groundwater alluvium valley the flow record also provide indication hydraulic conductivity alluvium underlie bedrock unit 
influence climatic factor groundwater measurement available thistle slide period prior slide april 
therefore discussion groundwater level time speculative 
however reactivation slide closely related time likely period high groundwater level 
the evidence support statement provide railway history regional climatic data 
the railway construct along spanish fork river 
movement equivalent event occur interval 
insight long term nature groundwater fluctuation wasatch mountain region obtain examine record water level great salt lake 
these fluctuation show figure appendix apparent record runoff entire great salt lake basin appreciably great period year record 
since runoff great salt lake basin come surround mountain lake level probably reflect precipitation runoff vicinity thistle slide 
study cumulative departure average annual precipitation salt lake city show wet cycle reach climax begin around 
would consider normal long term precipitation cycle directly reflect high groundwater table higher piezometric level depth within mountain slope 
thus would expect record piezometric level within thistle slide spring snowmelt late march early april 
cause slide the thistle landslide occur april gravity induce shear force tend cause downslope movement exceed available shear resistance slide mass

the committee study determine conclusively whether movement thistle slide begin bottom top 
however committee believe study available data might throw light aspect behavior slide 
superimpose background long short term persistent detrimental effect stability slide fluctuate effect annual spring snowmelt exceptionally heavy precipitation event 
these could decrease factor safety overall slide mass order percent percent 
thus factor safety snowmelt period effect snowmelt decrease factor safety percent remain factor safety could slope relatively stable although local area factor safety may local deformation might result 
figure sketch show schematically variation factor safety slide time 
this figure show seasonal effect snowmelt precipitation event 
rain fell late september 
figure also illustrate long term reduction factor safety due small slide debris flow advance time time onto upper portion slide 
snowmelt rainfall direct effect increase horizontal force water fill crack slide 
water also indirect delay effect increase water pressure act slip surface side bottom slide 
mean maximum shear resistance along internal plane zone shear within landslide also decrease water pressure within mass increase 
this decrease shear resistance significant key block appreciable internal deformation slide mass require general movement occur 
the remote possibility slide movement indirectly related local deformation near surface bedrock unit cannot completely eliminate 
this slide adjacent major regional thrust fault witkind page 
also witkind page indicate evaporite rock may occur depth slide 
therefore collapse due solution deformation relative mobility underlie rock might possible 
however unless direct evidence obtain timely involvement geologic factor would appear reasonable attribute cause slide immediate geologic environmental factor 
the period slide movement april perhaps extend due relationship rise lake level increase fluid pressure failure surface toe slide mass 
lake level increase would water pressure act within slide 
this behavior would tend decrease stability slide time increase volume debris deposit toe slide tend increase stability 
hence stability slide mass would remain low time reservoir level lower 
summary thistle landslide exist meta stable condition many year old slide comprise clay rich debris 
significant long term detrimental effect periodic addition earthflows shallow landslide upper portion main slide mass

the detrimental influence item would effective whether lake present 
for many landslide relative magnitude favorable unfavorable factor stability often quantitatively determined quantitative estimate make result net increase decrease stability 
however evaluate stability thistle slide committee reluctant make quantitative estimate stability 
this many important parameter still largely unknown example geometry key plane suspect example movement fluid pressure 
particular magnitude current seasonal fluctuation water pressure throughout landslide remain largely unknown 
some minor downhill movement landslide appear continue appear possible establish whether due readjustment slide follow major event continue activity overall slide could lead new movement 
however committee favor first possibility 
local landslide downstream particularly upstream slope blockage spanish fork canyon distinct possibility 
these slope presently steeper natural slope slide debris prior event steep natural slope toe slide approximately prior post1900 excavation railroad see sumsion photo 
hence time without remedial support one would expect current slope blockage would deteriorate slope note would prevail 
renew activity thistle slide due earthquake possibility 
however risk believe relatively small earthquake would probably occur time peak rainfall snowmelt affect slide 
with reservoir water allow pond upstream face slide mass four five detrimental factor note would operative 
addition would increase fluid pressure within beneath debris blockage 
the apparent beneficial effect increase water pressure would apply upstream face blockage 
reservoir use flood control fluctuate water level result additional detrimental effect 
these include adverse stability condition associate slow rapid drawdowns reservoir deterioration erosion due alternate wet dry landslide 
such effect accelerate clay dispersive nature report associated clay derive north horn formation 
with reservoir possibility renew landslide activity exist quite likely 
the committee felt extent renew slide would difficult predict would highly dependent upon nature new reservoir level fluctuation usage nature extent remedial measure take 
thus current information quantitative evaluation likelihood renew slide appear warrant 
furthermore assurance additional exploration slide would appreciably improve one ability predict future behavior thistle landslide 
likelihood internal erosion and piping there possibility internal erosion pip slide block spanish fork canyon use dam 
the likelihood process occur depends depth water retain lake length time water impound nature distribution material form blockage foundation 
although distribution low permeability high permeability material within landslide largely unknown experience fill drain lake show landslide ability impound water safely 
water level lake keep elevation elevation low point highway average hydraulic gradient across blockage would 
seem unlikely level impoundment would produce catastrophic internal erosion pip even persisted period month 
significantly high level impoundment long period retention would entail great risk internal erosion pip within beneath blockage 
possible quantify risk associate deeply longer impoundment distribution material within slide well know 
know however material 
form much landslide easily credible distribution high permeability low permeability material within slide mass may extremely adverse 
thus maximum hydraulic gradient within slide might much high average value calculable knowledge external water level 
the consequence pip failure landslide could rapid loss reservoir possible downstream flow rate excess attainable ungated tunnel 
thus impoundment elevation would involve great probability failure great chance disastrous consequence failure occur

stabilization measure consider relative ease material erode well stability slope failure 
construction embankment wall divert earth flow slide away intake

installation warn system detect blockage low level intake portal contingency plan removal 
question can slide utilized following purpose 
flood control low head short period time irrigation storage moderate head month multi purpose recreation irrigation flood control hydroelectric power high head permanent storage 
committee opinion landslide safely use flood control dam store water elevation period month 
the committee believe would unsafe store water high elevation unless extensive exploration landslide undertaken ass stability 
the committee believe significant possibility exploration might prove inconclusive matter extensive program might reveal deficiency could remedied reasonable cost 
seem likely multiple use reservoir develop low cost much great reliability construct dam upstream landslide blockage rather modify blockage use dam 
the continued ability route flow around landslide depend successful operation lowlevel outlet tunnel 
thus periodic inspection tunnel intake shaft rock slope outlet imperative

test condition relatively thin layer sample place direct shear box porous stone sample 
the test conduct sample remain saturate throughout test 
the sample subject vertical load would order estimate vertical stress level sample recover core 
the consolidation sample maximum vertical stress measure time data use determine rate shear displacement 
series four test run sample 
each test make approximately follow vertical stress level 
psi psi psi psi 
follow load horizontal shear plane may precut sample wire knife 
precutting reduce amount shear displacement require reach residual value shear resistance 
the rate shear generally calculate use standard method consolidation data 
alternatively one may simply use next slowest rate available machine 
during shear desirable continuous record vertical displacement sample preferably locations corner sample well horizontal displacement 
the vertical displacement serve help correct result effect non horizontal movement upper shear platform help recognize non representative result large particle interfere platen movement 
when minimum equilibrium residual shear strength obtain give rate displacement rate displacement increase time shear resistance 
record several minute 
follow rate decrease original several minute longer require 
these increase decrease shear rate serve provide positive evidence rate select primary test correct uneffected excess pore water pressure 
displacement require achieve residual value exceed capacity machine test must stop direction shear displacement reverse 
when test complete vertical load increment load reduce test continue next low vertical stress 
test four level vertical stress constitute series test require sample 
sample description clay mineral analysis when series test complete sample failure plane describe possible 
time small soil sample select center failure plane water content sample determine 
would also desirable clay mineral analysis complete least three sample 
the material analyse take failure plane sample use direct shear strength test 
plot plot shear resistance record normal stress provide sample 
these result accompany complete set lab data sheet include plot shear strength vertical horizontal displacement obtain laboratory testing
