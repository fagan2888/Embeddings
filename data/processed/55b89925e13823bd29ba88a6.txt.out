introduction during summer reconnaissance investigation make part southern utah search new deposit uranium bear carbonaceous rock 
coal carbonaceous shale cretaceous age systematically sample three major area kaiparowits plateau henry mountains kolob terrace fig 
eighty sample submit uranium analysis radioactivity measurement 
they include sample coal carbonaceous shale volcanic rock sandstone water evaporite 
the radioactivity measurement chemical analysis sample give table 
the sample appreciably radioactive contain uranium amount economic importance 
the rock uranium content could consider normal type lithology thin bed carbonaceous shale 
field radioactivity measurement indicate higher equivalent uranium content determine laboratory analysis 
this may due contamination fallout heavy southern utah entire period investigation 
background reading field geiger scintillation counter high locality kolob terrace instrument could use mine freshly dig pit 
purpose scope this reconnaissance undertaken attempt locate deposit uranium bear carbonaceous material especially coal might use byproduct source uranium
