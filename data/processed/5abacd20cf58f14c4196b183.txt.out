dill propose new scheme classiﬁcation mineral deposit 
all research development fuel high demand systematization geological information interpretation accumulate two past decade attention pay original research base data collection conceptual treatment multiple particular evidence 
such situation appear favorable development new geological classiﬁcations 
the geological history describe two mode namely via process event 
ﬁrst case attention pay continuous change 
second case discrete change consider 
however two mode description mutually exclude process understood series event 
noted event match trend even constitute directly whereas event mark signiﬁcant deviation trend interruption latter 
evidently geological event deserve classiﬁed 
the fundamental reason urgency accurate description geological event necessity clear distinction ordinary catastrophic event

more decade ago ruban attempt systematize knowledge geological event tentative idea publish russian local edition need justiﬁcation test 
the main objective present paper propose new classiﬁcation episodic event long term geological process demonstrate application different phenomenon include biodiversity dynamic global sea level change etc 
stress purpose classiﬁcation provision template easy distinction episodic event available curve reﬂecting dynamic various long term geological process 
moreover present paper aim show circle geological event broad many event addition well know event mass extinction oceanic anoxic event 
classiﬁcation episodic event 
correspond episode geological time thus call episodic event 
however simple deﬁnition enough 
sea level rise fall change biodiversity event occur permanently earth history 
contrast well know silurian environmental perturbation aldridge jeppson jeppson aldridge calner johnson lehnert spiridonov cretaceous oceanic anoxic event schlanger jenkyns erba takashima faucher individual event earth history 
this sensible make distinction continuous discrete change relevant event 
moreover many discrete change highly complex nature cannot attribute single geological process 
fact oceanic anoxic event associate striking perturbation carbon cycle geochemical anomaly palaeobioproductivity change fossil diversity decline etc 
provisionally suggest assign episodic event event relevant continuous change link single process 
the oaes discrete event consider episodic event sensu stricto 
there may different approach recognition episodic event choice proper approach determine analytical need particular study 
give geological process lead apparently chaotic non cyclic change episodic event related principal change increase decrease acceleration etc 
parameter fig 
process less cyclic episodic event correspond half cycle fig 
finally case process characterize multiple minor change superimpose strong change latter entirely understood episodic event fig 
episodic event analyze two approach 
the ﬁrst approach simple analysis curve describe geological process 
case sequence event establish event describe 
for instance event fig 
deﬁned rise event slight fall event accelerate fall 
course change episodes also treated event depend research need 
the second approach advance suitable long term geological process study 
case necessary analyze episodic event reference trend tendency 
the change relevant event expression long term trend change may mark change trend long term increase longterm decrease 
these elementary consideration form basis distinction numerous type episodic event 
conceptual remark 
type event 
geological event essentially change geological environment particular constituent 
long term scale geological process describe series continuous change characteristic parameter 
for instance eustasy permanent change global sea level measure meter relatively present position case event global sealevel rise fall cycle repeat permanently 
course different change distinguish event 
the latter almost immediate thus look like point curve describe geological process 
however detect event complex task successful solution depend resolution available data methodological error link curve reconstruction 
more often geologists deal event last reasonable time may recognize regular basis less long term scale 
these event 
several category episodic event distinguish regard scale shape relation trend change consideration parameter also possible see 
accord scale event either ordinary anomalous fig 
the former event constitute signiﬁcant part trend relevant change mark serious deviation trend 
contrast anomalous event serious deviation trend 
shape mean appearance event analyze curve describing change characteristic parameter give geological process 
case episodic event positive negative neutral 
positive event mark change lead high value position parameter 
typical example event fig 
contrast negative event mark change lead low value position parameter 
ruban geoscience frontier 377e389 
different approach episodic event recognition half cycle approach approach approach 
example event fig 
finally neutral event mark apparent absence almost total absence change 
well say change occur geological process continue change reﬂected poorly reﬂected analyzed curve 
typical example event fig 
ordinary versus anomalous episodic event 
there may also different relation episodic event trend change 
this category important consideration permit emphasis role give event geological history 
some event sustain trend event facilitate contrast stabilize trend ﬁnally may event lead total change trend increase trend decrease trend 
accord possible relation seven category episodic event distinguish relevant event term successive interrupt facilitative stabilize transform increase decreasing fig 
add pattern combine 
the classiﬁcation episodic event considers three parameter scale shape relation trend change 
these parameter combine differently numerous type possible episodic event establish result table 
this classiﬁcation use purpose analysis real geological data analysis contribute test possible improvement classiﬁcation 
five case example give deal application propose classiﬁcation episodic event different long term process geological history 
course parameter consider necessary 
for instance may include spatial rank duration origin see also walliser 
however precaution necessary 
the spatial rank global regional local event reﬂects spatial restriction analyze curve 
evident curve depict change global process use interpretation global event latter cannot interpret regional curve 
spatial rank exclude main parameter simply already know information chosen analysis 
the duration event always easy judge 
course advance geochronological geochemical study permit measure length event detailed information available many case 
much depend measure 
for instance establish endpermian catastrophe relatively short term event duration 104en year erwin huang 
however exclude neither prelude event follow recovery event may appear much longer 
the problem kind consider wang 
moreover geologic time scale permanent change ogg thus seem relatively short today may become short year later vice versa 
finally origin event always clear interpret curve similarly spatial rank 
course usually easy make distinction abiotic biotic event 
however detailed classiﬁcation episodic event basis origin would difﬁcult task successful solution require classiﬁcation long term geological process mean construction typology majority know geological phenomenon 
such typology note classiﬁcation subjective limit use classiﬁcation propose paper 
anyway spatial rank duration origin parameter use good description establish episodic event necessary possible 
principally recognition mention type episodic event do quantitative approach 
however latter propose employ present paper three mean reason 
first classiﬁcations especially new one simple possible become really clear 
second approach criterion quantitative judgment episodic event may different depend research need preference 
each classiﬁcation employ approach criterion classiﬁcation

note trend original curve show 
change mark blue color 
subjective dependent available information mean less acceptability restrict use specialist 
third important many curve describe geological process use interpretation episodic unit reconstruct semi quantitative basis low resolution 
therefore curve difﬁcult quantify
