provide brief description craton rock override thrust belt first major section geology region deal rock structure ieast thrust belt southwest montana area reasonably well know well describe early literature 
the following section describe different part thrust belt sequence westward frontal fold thrust zone grasshopper thrust plate finally medicine lodge thrust plate 
this section briefly summarize mainly columnar form description earlier literature rock sequence part thrust belt briefly outline major change difference rock sequence
