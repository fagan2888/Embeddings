profile extend axially khushaymiyah complex across large batholith east profile transverse extend across uyaijah ring structure within khushaymiyah complex 
the shape gravity anomaly suggest batholith compose tabular pluton pluton horizontal extent great vertical whose source zone locate absolute gravity minimum 
model anomaly minimum locate feeder zone pluton locus maximum mass deficiency 
preliminary interpretation regional gradient show figure remove profile residual anomaly interpret due spherical source 
the analysis yield depth center mass 
batholith expose surface radius sphere canbe assumed thus density contrast require cause anomaly 
the calculated anomaly fig 
systematically great observe residual imply mass deficiency large thus depth estimate certainly upper bound 
the spherical source interpretation implies source mainly depths less density contrast approximately 
the shape anomaly fact upper surface nearly flat imply source probably funnel shape least decrease size depth

bulge gradient present profile large bound abrupt offset anomaly value 
the sharpness offset implies source bulge shallow 
examination geologic map theobald alcott show bulge coincides zone northwest trend mafic dike cut complex along shear zone parallel nearby najd fault zone 
the analysis dodge indicate dike rock mean density range composition basalt andesite 
the fact dike highly altered case affect magnetic response however alteration little effect rock density since alteration mineral nearly density mineral form 
judge amplitude wavelength bulge profile volume ratio dike host rock probably increase depth 
dodge give rock bulk density measurement suite sample major rock unit area 
these data plot scatterplot format convenience estimate density contrast model calculation show figure 
the figure show granite density contrast metasediments whereas granodiorite contrast 
average density contrast infer spherical source model correct measure density representative actual mean density depth granodiorite must volumetrically small alkalic granite granite make percent batholithic mass 
the amphibolite show figure report dodge infolded faulted metasediments small sliver pod however literature give indication size 
examination scale geologic map bois other show mapped amphibolite quite far khushaymiyah area appear part crystalline rock najd zone southwest 
the amphibolite assume volumetrically unimportant however constitute say percent host rock mean host rock density would increase thus density contrast would increase computed depth volume batholithic rock would decrease 
the model follow therefore place maximum limit depth extent volume pluton ring complex

addition northeast geologic situation complex metasediments wedge two pluton shape profile affect gravity anomaly intrusive rock 
the southwest side anomaly profile fig 
analyse first use model dip interface step extend infinitely direction normal profile formulate grant west 
the result calculation show depth source essentially zero expected average dip density discontinuity degree northeast 
the derivation parameter model example depth bottom density contrast reliable parameter depend upon total amplitude gravity anomaly use two dimensional model three dimensional case valid 
for northeast gradient profile lack data beyond edge ring structure noise introduce profile near surface source make quantitative analysis method impossible 
however inspection profile show average dip interface must one third one half southwest gradient 
each half profile model curve fit technique use model curve frusta right circular cone album phoenix corp 
good fit obtain gradient profile yield model vertical contact best fit southwest gradient album cone slope vary increment degree 
this agree estimate slope derive fault interpretation 
for northeast gradient best fit degree dip southwest 
for model depth bottom model calculate density contrast 
the density contrast agree nicely obtain spherical source model 
the final step model calculate excess mass cause ring complex grant west 
the bouguer gravity anomaly map figure use contain strong regional trend affect anomaly amplitude estimate 
instead second map draw isostatic gravity reduction getting appendix account regional variation 
this map show figure superimpose geologic base 
the estimate contour closure part anomaly caused ring complex also show 
compensate polarimeter use measure area enclose contour include zero contour fig 
the result area convert unit mgal numerically integrated yield desire integral correct compensate lack anomaly definition distance source use method describe grant west 
the result mass deficiency estimate the mass circular cylinder radius mean radius ring complex thickness density contrast the mass body make half cylinder half circular cone frustrum dip horizontal thickness density contrast the value mass two body bracket amount estimate mass deficiency 
thus substantiate general feature model 
the volume proportion deduce granodiorite percent granite percent 
this contrast percent granodiorite percent core plus ring dike granite see outcrop
