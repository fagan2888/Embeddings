logical assume spring directly associate uraniferous calcite vein spring existence time land surface east tensleep outcrop lower foot 
low land surface foot area would take many thousand year 
radioactivity surface evidence uranium mineral become progressively less distance present level spring become great 
this may indicate either less uranium available deposition calcite vein land surface high uranium leach calcite vein deposit
