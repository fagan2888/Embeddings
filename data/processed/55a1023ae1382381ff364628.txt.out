discussion the field observation present permit make important generalization fault zone deformation 
first encouraging field rock show distinct textural characteristic rock group similar fashion observe along fault see higgins sibson 
the textural type randomly distribute within fault zone instead order distribution 
with exception mylonites deformation observed represent brittle shallow crustal environment 
although part contact gradational specific contact differ 
for instance sharp transition competent calcite fill limestone breccias north fault weak gouge paste porous limestone microbreccias towards middle fault zone 
surprisingly transition gouge microbreccias meta igenous cataclasites texturally pronounce 
the textural variation lack internal fabric limestone microbreccias gouge suggest considerable small scale strain heterogeneity across fault zone 
for dominantly brittle environment seem likely shear zone homogenization result consequence large shear strain 
instead continual deformation probably enhance textural distribution within fault zone 
also strike within fault zone material apparently porous weak outside shear zone 
this observation contrast significantly laboratory experiment simulate gouge show 
material deforms compact consequently strengthen shimamoto shi other 
lastly occurrence mylonite gneiss within fault zone important understand complex structure fault zone 
the mylonite represent deeper ductile crustal deformation environment juxtapose brittle cataclasites 
the contact mylonites cataclasites well expose 
yet structural position within fault zone fact dominant foliation consistently dip towards fault suggest rock may bring along high angle reverse fault 
this analogous relationship discuss sibson reverse slip along alpine fault 
expect refine observation optical microscopy study achieve good understand fault zone process

previous study normal load dependence friction 
from scientific historical standpoint attempt formulate theory friction begin two basic law first clearly describe leonardo vinci 15th century rediscover amontons verify coulomb 
vinci word maccurdy friction produce double amount effort weight double the friction make weight equal resistance begin movement although contact may different breadth length 
state law establish frictional resistance directly proportional load independent apparent area contact 
subsequent work bowden tabor kragelskii demonstrate real area contact contact surface fraction nominal area approximately proportional normal load independent nominal area 
this provide explanation empirical law one assume frictional resistance directly proportional real area contact 
such assumption follow adhesion theory friction bowden tabor wherein frictional force arises existence molecular bond asperity contact frictional force directly proportional number bond turn proportional real area contact 
the coefficient friction constant proportionality frictional resistance normal load 
use thermodye technique teufel measure real area contact function normal stress ground surface tennessee sandstone verify approximately linear relation 
show increase normal stress real contact area increase increase number contact asperity also increase area individual contact 
this result differ somehwat study metal kragelskii increase real contact area load determine primarily increase number contact 
however net effect term total real contact area case 
elastic model kragelskii represent asperity assembly cylindrical rod whose variation height across surface describe distribution function predict relation real contact area normal stress form a2v

efficacy model precisely fitting data form

also contact high normal stress probably inelastic 
fractional contact area 
case elastic model would expect fit data precisely 
time dependence friction 
another aspect friction widely document time dependence coefficient friction kragelskii recognize approach surface hence real contact area depend duration action normal load consequently must relation frictional resistance rheological property asperity junction 
hunter obtain experimental result pivot bearing indicate increase frictional force duration static contact dokos obtain similar result steel express static coefficient linear function logarithm time 
dieterich demonstrate functional dependence variety rock normal stress range mpa note time effect contingent upon generation gouge rock surface 
keep previous theory bowden tabor kragelskii dieterich explain increase frictional resistance duration static contact time dependent increase real contact area 
similarly many study variation friction coefficient slide velocity 
this first investigated coulomb although concluded frictional sliding like material shear resistance almost independent slide speed 
however observe slight dependency material 
early italian scientist conti establish important relationship friction coefficient slide speed 
pass maximum increase velocity 
this verify kimball show general property many solid 
dieterich demonstrate inverse relation friction coefficient slide velocity westerly granite granodiorite teufel logan demonstrate similar effect tennessee sandstone 
use thermodye technique show decreasing displacement rate range real contact area increase increase number contact asperity creep individual contact 
the increase frictional resistance decrease displacement rate interpret term increase real contact area 
the relation dependence friction coefficient slide velocity duration static contact recognize kragelskii 
equation dieterich equation average duration population contact slide velocity give constant dimension length 
accord dieterich constant represent displacement necessary change completely population contact depend surface roughness 
kragelskii provide explanation observe maximum friction velocity relation term two process compete 
note increase slide velocity reduces time interval contact cause reduction contact area therefore reduction frictional resistance viscous effect cause frictional resistance increase 
increase velocity 
depend effect dominate frictionvelocity relation exhibit net negative net positive characteristic respectively 
this reasoning also adopt dieterich johnson 
temperature dependence friction 
the effect temperature frictional resistance differ depend upon material circumstance 
for reason restrict discussion effect observe rock 
general frictional strength report independent temperature temperature usually onset intracrystalline deformation process begin affect material response example raleigh paterson brace stesky 
however evidence increase frictional strength temperature example drennon handy frictional slide limestone hornblendebiotite schist friedman 
the experimental work report address problem detail discuss later 
sufficient note increase frictional strength temperature even temperature independence frictional strength effect contrary expect basis arrhenius equation glasstone reaction rate frequency factor activation energy 
this equation well establish rate process theory applicable process involve rearrangement matter 
predicts increase temperature lead high reaction 
rate turn imply low strength impose boundary strain rate 
bowden tabor kragelskii discuss effect frictional behavior temperature rise cause frictional heating 
this effect severely complicate analysis consider study 
teufel teufel logan measure contact temperature frictional slide dry tennessee sandstone 
they conclude contact temperature rise significantly ambient temperature slide mode stable shear dis placement rate 
however unstable frictional sliding stick slip maximum temperature average surface temperature reach 
the dual nature friction 
kragelskii point frictional resistance dual molecular mechanical nature friction arise mechanical interaction due mutual interpenetration individual contact point molecular interaction due mutual attraction surface 
much discussion revolve around relative contribution process 
clearly mechanical interaction depend simply area contact molecular interaction 
therefore mechanical interaction dominates would incorrect assume frictional resistance directly proportional real area contact 
worth note molecular interaction adhesion varies inversely fourth power distance therefore practice either negligibly small lead formation strong bond 
thus rock mechanic standpoint high normal stress encounter crustal environment lead asperity contact intimate enough 
adhesion play important role 
this reasoning use follow analysis stimulate base upon work rabinowicz kragelskii dieterich johnson 
development model outset point although discussion primarily concern process occur contact junction two discrete surface generalization multiple contact surface hence shear zone polycrystalline aggregate immediately exclude 
before proceed theory two observation make concern deformation material condition exhibit considerable ductility 
these observation subsequently adopt generality must therefore regarded assumption supportive evidence 
for ductile deformation response material stress strain rate input approximately independent mean stress confine pressure strain rate dependence deviatoric stress positive characteristic increase function strain rate

gain justification atomic scale consideration effect pressure periodic lattice force

these characteristic appear fundamental rheologic 
response fully dense ceramic metal rock crystalline solid without porosity provide basis upon development theory rest 
thus deviation characteristic assume represent effect unrelated continuum behavior crystal lattice

experimental result dieterich johnson stesky laboratory suggest follow 
low temperature increase deformation rate cause net decrease frictional shearing strength decrease great corresponding increase 
this regime negative rate sensitivity regime potential instability accelerate creep stick slip may occur rabinowicz 
instability possible energetically favorable system deform faster rate 
for reason negative rate sensitivity favor deformation along discrete plane within shear zone rather uniform flow discrete deformation maximize deformation rate hence minimize shear stress require slip 
intermediate temperature shear strength become insensitive change deformation rate decrease balance correspond increase 
this correspond maximum friction versus temperature friction versus velocity relation 
high temperature increase deformation rate increase great decrease frictional shearing strength display usual positive rate sensitivity increase deformation rate cause net increase shearing 
within regime stick slip instability energetically feasible deformation uniform flow favor minimizes deformation rate thus minimize shear stress necessary flow rabinowicz
