the phonodoree formation probably represent deposition flood plain 
the excellent rounding grain pebbles lack silt clay sandy bed suggest near shore environment

the unit also contain large fragment quartzite feldspathic sandstone mudstone similar rock immediately underlie phonodoree formation 
pebble cobble subrounded wellrounded set matrix compose mostly angular subangular sand granule

west sif vaya sequence partly cover alluvium maroon bed seemingly cover greenish gray volcanic conglomerate angular conglomerate bed 
except section southeast copperosity mine thickness vekol foot 
these four section broadly similar match detail 
the difference may partly due fault explanation entirely satisfactory broad sequence rock type repeat 
plausible explanation sediment section deposit separate valley separate fan different source area 
also individual section may include unrecognized unconformities may less similar seem 
certainly change section size angularity composition fragment latite dacite andesite suggest succession volcanic eruption interval uplift 
furthermore general alternation channel lens conglomerate bed mudstone suggest deposition continental condition 
these conjugate line evidence indicate vekol formation derive source area undergo uplift vulcan vekol lay several adjacent valley otherwise locally distinct environment

chiapuk rhyolite the chiapuk rhyolite name nearby village chiapuk weld ash flow crop mile west reward mine 
the southern part area exposure type locality 
where basal contact expose weld tuff seem lie conformably vekol however long reach contact cut obliquely across strike vekol chiapuk probably separate vekol erosion surface low relief 
the top unit either cut fault abut tuff escabrosa limestone cover alluvium 
the chiapuk rhyolite include weld tuff tuff agglomerate probably textural variant ash flow 
the tuff dense porous creamy grayish pink rock whose groundmass contain many angular fragment dense pink porphyritic rhyolite gray porous pumice 
the fragment may much inch long 
the groundmass generally cryptocrystalline show band suggestive plastic flow particularly around pink rhyolite fragment commonly groundmass contains small fragment rhyolite pumice break feldspar crystal 
the truncated section weld tuff foot thick much thin similar section rhyolitic ash flow associate rock elsewhere reservation 
the chiapuk rhyolite similar lithologically stratigraphically structurally cat mountain rhyolite brown tucson mountain rhyolitic deposit several intervene area 
the chiapuk also cut dike monzonite porphyry analogous quartz monzonite dike cut cat mountain 
rock similar cat mountain also crop 
mesozoic formation vekol mountain arizona silver bell mountain richard courtright half way tucson vekol mountain boskruge mountain mile west tucson 
the two unit probably correlate evidence still insufficient conclude actually one formation 
the cat mountain rhyolite date million year rhyolite deposit bell mountain south roskruges million year damon 
the chiapuk rhyolite sufficiently similar deposit consider contemporaneous like probably also late cretaceous age
