some gold however example fox gulch squirrel creek platinum creek mouth squirrel creek introduce glacial action glacial ice north penetrate valley 
the gold find valley therefore local origin may connect genetically certain dike sodic granite syenite cut ultrabasic rock 
sodic granite syenites believe differentiates basic magma think dross gold alloy might show relationship dross platinum metal 
accordingly analysis make laboratory geological survey hand pick sample gold spuirrel creek

ordinarily copper iron constitute dross placer gold relative proportion two metal vary greatly 
analysis iron dominant mineral dross copper occur minute amount 
nickel also form small proportion dross nevertheless nearly times plentiful copper 
the analyst interpret chromium alloyed metal cr203 intergrown include grain gold form chromite feo cr2o3 
this justified fact alloy chromium find complete analysis platinum metal 
the presence cr2o3 show gold must occur bedrock either intergrown chromite contact 
these fact consider adequate relate gold genetically chromite therefore indirectly platinum 
connection also worth mention placer gold hold weakly strong electromagnet though pure gold know diamagnetic 
summary conclusion regard goodnews bay platinum deposit red susie mountain compose ultrabasic rock red mountain except peripheral zone make largely variety peridotite know dunite 
the platinum placer localize mainly valley platinum creek tributary valley clara creek valley salmon river downstream mouth gulch drain eastern side red mountain 
part world platinum metal know associate generally though exclusively ultrabasic rock 
therefore platinum placer localize valley drain flank red mountain 
platinum deposit goodnews bay district 
little doubt dunite related rock red mountain bedrock source platinum metal 
the platinum metal however find place red mountain chemical analysis dunite show trace though small quantity platinum could detect amount rock ordinarily use make chemical analysis 
hand large nugget platinum metal find placer intergrown chromite chromite know constitute percent dunite red mountain 
moreover analysis pebble chromite constitute part placer concentrate show chromite contains ounce platinum metal ton 
therefore believe platinum metal find placer genetically associate chromite occur dunite 
believe dunite originated separation sinking crystal olivine cool magma 
most iron chrome ore limited miscibility magma also separate early stage process cool 
also infer intrusive body ultrabasic rock area though generally lenticular shape approximate vertical position time originate 
therefore follow dunite chromite associate platinum metal probably localize low part lenticular upright intrusive mass lenses subsequently bar erosion platinum metal begin freed bedrock source 
intrusive mass deeply erode ultrabasic rock may therefore contain much platinum possible explanation scarcity platinum metal stream gravel vicinity susie mountain 
from localization placer east side red mountain might infer bedrock source platinum metal likewise localize side mountain 
this may may true know northwest side red mountain site one lobe goodnews glacier 
therefore even platinum metal occur west side red mountain improbable extensive placer deposit would present side glacial action tend dissipate rather concentrate metallic element gravel 
moreover streams side mountain small would also appear insufficient time elapse since retreat glacier formation extensive recent platinum bearing deposit
