origin and age postglacial deposit and assessment potential hazard from future eruption mount baker washington jack hyde dwight crandell abstract eruption geologic process mount baker last year repeatedly affect adjacent area especially valley head volcano 
most mudflows volcano cause massive avalanche volcanic rock partly alter clay steam gas 
future mudflows like could move valley distance ten kilometre 
flood cause rapid melting snow ice lava flow hot rock debris could affect valley floor far volcano especially occurred time high stream discharge due cause 
small amount tephra airborne rock debris erupt least four time last year 
eruption like future probably would seriously endanger human life except within distance perhaps kilometres vent 
lava flow erupt least twice last year move two valley 
future lava flow directly endanger people movement typically slow escape possible 
eruption cause pyroclastic flow flow hot rock debris evidently occur one period flow restrict one valley 
pyroclastic flow seriously endanger human life area affect 
such flow move speed much bury valley floor tens metre hot rock debris distance much volcano

terminology the term tephra use refer fragmental volcanic debris throw volcanic vent transport air thorarinsson 
tephra consist pumice scoria mineral crystal dense rock fragment mixture 
both pumice scoria vesicular mean large amount visible pore space 
scoria somewhat less vesicular pumice typically dark gray brown whereas pumice generally white yellow 
pyroclastic flow hot dry flow volcanic rock debris move flank volcano 
such flow may extend many mile beyond volcano base accompany cloud fine grain material may rise flow height hundred thousand metre 
the downslope movement pyroclastic flow due chiefly gravity although explosive force eruption may provide high initial velocity 
hot air trap within debris hot gas emit rock fragment give pyroclastic flow high degree mobility 
the result deposit may consist pumice dense rock fragment 
pyroclastic flow deposit consist chiefly pumice commonly cause eruption gas rich magma flow mainly nonvesicular rock fragment generally originate avalanche newly erupt hot rock fragment flank volcano partial collapse grow volcanic dome spine 
ash cloud deposit form fine grain pyroclastic flow cloud airborne ash accompany flow crandell mullineaux 
these deposit restrict areal distribution tephra usually show rapid lateral change thickness grain size 
the deposit consist mostly lithic ash pumice common 
mudflow mass water saturate rock debris move downslope fluid influence gravity 
during movement mudflow resembles flow mass wet concrete 
rock fragment volcanic mudflow may either hot cold 
mudflows originate result eruption generally cause spillover crater lake largescale melting snow ice hot rock debris steam volcanic explosion cause avalanche saturate rock debris

potential geologic hazard although mount baker form prior last major glaciation erupt infrequently since repetition event occur volcano last year could threaten human life cause property damage 
problem inherent many evaluation geological hazard long time interval event long comparison human lifespan 
mount baker example interval successive mudflows give valley may long several thousand year 
nevertheless potentially dangerous mudflow could occur virtually time 
another problem farreaching effect certain kind volcanic event 
although area greatest potential hazard close volcano tephra mudflows flood affect area tens kilometre downwind downvalley 
for example extensive mudflow mount baker move downvalley least mudflows volcanoes washington travel 
there people area close volcano much year late spring summer early fall month see large increase transient population especially within mount baker national forest 
basis visitor use figure compile forest service summer weekend might person within area could cover mudflow moderate size 
such event might occur without warn 
potentially hazardous event could occur mount baker include formation mudflows avalanche eruption tephra hot pyroclastic flow lava flow 
possible danger associate event describe follow section 
mudflows avalanche rock debris mount baker great potential geologic hazard avalanche rock debris slop volcano movement result mass downvalley mudflow 
mudflows could originate without warn without associate volcanic activity although eruption would greatly increase probability event 
mudflows move speed per hour bury everything path mud rock debris 
road bridge structure could destroy severely damage 
mudflow move reservoir would displace equivalent volur 
water could result flood downstream dam 
many mudflows mount baker contain hydrothermally alter rock fragment clay 
the distribution mudflows suggest originate either sherman crater area vicinity dorr steamfield northeast flank mountain 
future mudflows presumably cause avalanche alter rock area 
avalanche rock debris high volcano conceivably could move downslope high speed like avalanche ice rock huascaran mountain peru plafker other 
that avalanche volume least million descended vertical distance travel 
it average speed distance 
rapid movement might facilitate friction reduce cushion air trap compress beneath mass hurtle ramplike obstacle along path 
within short distance source avalanche become highly fluid mobile mass mud boulder 
when main body avalanche come rest large destructive wave water debris travel farther downvalley average speed plafker other 
the large deposit mount baker probably move downvalley avalanche rainbow creek valley 
that avalanche descend least vertically within distance 
the area avalanche rock debris would serious consequence boulder creek valley baker lake 
rock mass volume much million could avalanche onto boulder glacier cliff north south sherman crater 
the rock mass altitude first slope volcano range 
the slope floor boulder creek valley flattens less near baker lake 
the distance potential source area lake vertical difference height the slide fall rock mass size mount baker probably would require eruption steam explosion strong local earthquake 
some event probably would also impart initially high velocity mass 
the paths avalanche mount baker probably would restrict zone high risk mudflows flood addition large avalanche move baker lake could cause one wave would threaten area along shoreline might overtop dam 
the likelihood large avalanche mount baker cannot realistically assessed volume distance movement anticipate 
nevertheless possibility mass reach far baker lake disregard 
even though distance seem great 
avalanche move far would require coefficient friction vertical drop divide horizontal distance nearly avalanche huascaran mountain plafker other 
such great distance movement probably require exceptionally favorable condition large volume material high velocity could provide steep initial drop explosion development cushion compress air beneath move avalanche 
tephra hazard tephra great downwind close vent depend volume rate duration eruption strength direction wind distance volcano wilcox mullineaux

pyroclastic flow pyroclastic flow deposit find valley boulder creek seem form one eruptive period 
the infrequency past eruption produce pyroclastic flow suggest danger similar event future great 
however pyroclastic flow occur future volcanic activity could move least far valley head volcano 
the main danger pyroclastic flow result basal flow hot rock debris accompany cloud hot ash gas possible high speed flow cloud 
pyroclastic flow commonly move speed temperature hundred degree mixture hot rock fragment ash could bury valley floor depths many ten metre cloud hot ash gas could cause asphyxiation burn skin injury impact rock fragment 
forest fire could start hot debris

these area include community glacier northwest mount baker 
lava flow reach mouth glacier creek might block road available evacuation develop area however downvalley movement lava flow would slow enough permit evacuation long highway threaten 
lava flow could endanger resort campgrounds forest service facility along baker lake would threaten property rather life 
upper baker dam associate service facility near mouth sulphur creek would directly affect unless large volume lava erupt 
the indirect effect eruption lava serious direct effect 
eruption lava onto snowfield glacier could generate disastrous flood mudflows 
although lava flow also could start forest fire cover road lava volcano like mount baker generally move slowly people could evacuate endanger area 
discussion risk zone the eruptive behavior mount baker last year suggest eruption lava flow pyroclastic flow future less likely eruption tephra formation mudflows thus two general category potential hazard distinguish one another
