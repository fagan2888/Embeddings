this section analyze theis recovery method give transmissivity day 
the latter part drawdown curve figure use compute transmissivity assumption make vertical impermeable boundary affect portion curve

conclusion recommendation data collect test well drill southeast post headquarters white sand missile range show fresh water lens foot thick vicinity 
this lens thicken foot near 
supply well complete near site yield excess gallon per minute 
gravel packing consider mean minimize sand future test production well locality 
potable water occur probably within bedrock encounter depth foot 
the relatively low transmissivity measure indicate well complete near mountain front unconsolidated material low yield well complete fan deposit far basin 
the best quality water measure test well rhodes canyon range center apparently dissolve solid content excess 
well drill area encounter fine grain material poor water bearing property 
yield well would probably great gallon per minute
