this report describe background goal direction nuclear fuels program significant accomplishment past year 
introduction problem energy fuel supply oil natural gas provide percent energy consume united state 
much fuel import nation become increasingly dependent foreign supplier 
nuclear fuel use almost exclusively electrical power generation provide percent energy consume 
most remain energy need country meet burn coal 
production oil united state decline since production natural gas decline since increase exploration fail improve picture economic reserve materially 
these fact become focus national attention short term embargo drastically cut supply import oil gas 
response government announce policy increase use nuclear fuel coal 
follow course however proven easy say do 
coal production increase slowly problem environmental concern lack mining equipment skilled labor major labor strike transport shortage well regulatory problem time lag impose necessity conversion electricity generate plant industrial facility natural gas coal 
increase nuclear fuel use meet similar barrier 
there great environmental concern safety nuclear powerplants community opt exclude plant area 
delay cause regulatory procedure environmental litigation result time involve building nuclear plant typically year 
this lead time combine inflate cost capital equipment construction lead utility cancel order nuclear reactor postpone abandon plan increase nuclear power generation still recently new concern raise safe storage radioactive waste produce nuclear plant 
still factor weigh heavily decide future nuclear power need nuclear mineral fuel 
for example need new fuel resource depend upon government decision whether spent fuel may recycle whether united state intend develop breeder reactor technology fuel produce consume 
these two factor involve important problem establish absolute security radioactive material well geopolitical aspect encourage adoption nuclear technology produce weapon grade material byproduct 
adjunct concern decision may make future build reactor partly entirely use thorium fuel instead uranium another uncertainty determine future uranium thorium need 
other unknowns uranium supply demand equation whether united state access foreign supply uranium case need whether united state prove uranium resource excess project need export user nation consider 
though uncertainty great nuclear power represent significant potential element unite state world mix potential must understand policy formulation 
establish national course toward appropriate mixture energy source serve nation short intermediate long term need essential best possible assessment national uranium thorium resource 
and achieve assessment clear understanding geology uranium occurrence essential 
the national need improve resource assessment the current state understanding uranium resource availability illustrate conclusion two report expert consultant prepare 
one report commission ford foundation conclude enough domestic uranium cost dollar needs year enough high price suffice well next century 
the department energy many industry expert point current exploration discovery rate delay factor mine discover ore indicate report seriously overoptimistic 
the report panel commission national academy science consider many expert pessimistic 
concludes fivefold increase discovery rate development reserve need shortfall uranium supply felt well turn century early enough affect current nuclear plant project year lifetime 
neither report agree current resource estimate department energy assign responsibility national uranium resource estimate 
there ample room disagreement two report embody assumption project demand discovery rate mill capacity price fluctuation national world market next decade 
and department energy resource number involve calculate extension company reserve data surround unexplored ground assumption probable economic factor actually produce ore forward cost 
what lack reliable estimate basic figure much uranium potentially mineable ore grade concentration ground 
such figure easily acquire one truly know lie wait discover undrilled ground 
and art resource estimation generally involve exercise subjective probability 
one recent exercise major uranium area do group expert individual expert estimate vary factor 
two basic facet involve kind estimation geologic information area understand uranium habitat geologic set area method estimation potential resource unexplored ground 
both facet improve 
good appraisal regional resource require new data gather new estimation method develop exist one improve 
this must continue effort reliability resource value improve basic data method improve 
prime importance improvement knowledge economic uranium miner key produce area differ geology 
area contain known reserve also almost certainly large percentage nation undiscovered resource 
well knowledge geology mode uranium occurrence key area permit accurate assessment 
unknown ground compare geology analogous key area 
this knowledge essential attempt estimate favor potential resource outward deposit surround area downward typically shallow depth far drill 
this also help industry sharpen effort find resource convert reserve thereby continue upgrade resource data know uranium area 
the need information even well know sandstone area show figure decrease effectiveness drill find ore evident 
this trend reverse improved understanding therefore luck uranium deposit form 
for uranium nonsandstone setting still basic geologic information need little known occurrence united state 
yet unite state area geologically similar elsewhere world contain enormous uranium resource igneous metamorphic rock 
must learn foreign deposit model possibly analogous setting country make reliable uranium resource 
for thorium picture similar 
only one high temperature gas reactor use thorium partial replacement uranium fuel build operate characteristic still assess 
other reactor would use thorium design stage 
another factor affect future demand possibility nation plan nuclear power may adopt technology produce plutonium byproduct 
thorium reactor could serve purpose thus may become widely used home abroad future 
accordingly assessment thorium resource become important estimate may help determine policy technology direction
