the chemical composition water derive mineral water come contact 
therefore composition bedrock major factor type natural water generate within study area 
addition wind bourn dust pick within study area outside study area deposit eolian material within study area 
water come contact material pick additional constituent 
the dominant process control ground water chemistry within study area dissolution gypsum interaction water carbonate rock 
water contact limestone dolomitic limestone increase concentration ca2 mg2 hco3 
the present hco3 ion imparts acid buffer capacity water proportional concentration 
the bicarbonate ion consume ion raise reaction 
buffer bicarbonate ion hco3 h2co3 
the water equilibrium calcite pco2 calculate average pco2 water use phreeqec buffer calcite value approximately see drever detail calculation 
water come contact acid water process oxidize sulfide acid rain water natural buffer capacity neutralizing introduce acid 
the dissolution gypsum responsible high concentration ca2 so42 water within study area 
gypsum occur within several formation within permian sedimentary rock 
addition gypsum dissolve easily do past reprecipitated runoff contain high concentration ca2 so42 evaporate form temporary shallow lake dry 
this material easily pick wind redistribute available dissolution 
gypsum ubiquitous surface subsurface within study area 
the presence dissolution gypsum probably cause process dedolomitization subsurface 
this process describe black other begin gypsum dissolution release ca2 ion water 
with increase ca2 
calcium carbonate precipitate decrease carbonate ion 
the decrease carbonate ion water cause undersaturation dissolution respect dolomite 
the net effect process increase ca2 mg2 so42 decrease slight decrease bicarbonate concentration see miller detail 
other process within study area include dissolution halite precipitation halite surface capillary action evaporation oxidation organic material aquifer cause reduction oxidation potential 
the elevated chloride content ground water probably due dissolution halite present rock mancos shale 
halite often present deposition shale high content sea water 
because presence gypsum halite ground water contact permian shale high ca2 na2 so42 
chemistry water contact igneous alkalic rock much different water contact permian sedimentary rock 
these water evolve ca2 hco3 water low ionic strength value neutral slightly alkaline 
they well buffer water contact carbonate rock 
water within study area derive solely area igneous rock 
the small amount precipitation fall alkalic igneous rock subsurface water come contact igneous rock evolve toward low ionic strength water mix water derive permian sedimentary rock 
show earlier water pco2 contact carbonate mineral abundant bedrock study area buffer value approximately 
the average value water slightly low buffering calcite indicate process may responsible low 
cornudus mountain south significantly low predict buffer calcite miller 
cornudus mountains area much low value attribute oxidation sporatic petroleum organic material present within sedimentary rock 
this appear case three river area 
the process probably responsible slightly low value dedolomitization lower 
another process could also lower sulfate abundant ground water may reduce h2s reduce environment 
the process generate acid low water 
the reduce environment acid value also cause release iron manganese ground water 
environmental geochemistry three river study area natural anthropogenic related source contribute heavy metal acid environment 
the purpose section determine environmental problem may presently exist potentially exist mining occurs within study area future 
the study area sparsely populate industry present mining take place 
therefore environmental concern must consider context geology particular composition rock 
any present geochemical environmental problem result natural process occur rock study area subject chemical mechanical weathering 
the oxidation pyrite great effect release acid heavy metal natural water area 
pyrite appear absent surface rock 
three river area subsurface rock know contain significant amount pyrite 
addition rock present study area namely limestones sandstone alkalic igneous rock generally contain normal low concentration trace element 
shale particularly black shale anomalous concentration metal appear case shale study area 
other trace element rock also apparently low 
consequently minimal heavy metal acid release rock water normal weather 
two lithology present surface subsurface three river area effective mitigation acid drainage may presently future generate limestone dolomite caliche abundant often cement quaternary alluvium 
tertiary lacustrine bed contain calcite may also occur 
the carbonate mineral react water buffer raise 
heavy metal present hydrolyze precipitate high value 
the major rock group study area alkaline intrusive rock 
these rock less buffer capacity carbonate rock mainly form mineral plagioclase 
but ubiquitous occurrence calcite surficial material provide buffer capacity neutralize acid generate surface environment 
climate play significant role geochemical process 
water necessary chemical weathering occur 
the climate study area semi arid 
because low annual precipitation chemical weather surface probably take place pulse water present follow runoff storm 
within zone ground water water contact rock chemical process take place 
the geochemical environmental consequence future mine depend type mine would develop 
ree base metal precious metal deposit contain pyrite develop acid metal release would occur large amount carbonate mineral surround rock surfical material would quickly buffer acid metal 
effect surface would minimal 
summary main geochemical environmental concern presently study area presence slightly saline water due abundant gypsum sometimes halite neutral slightly acid ground water due dedolomitization reduction sulfate moderately elevate concentration nitrate possibly due leach cattle waste vicinity well site 
these problem except nitrate due natural process operate least year 
possible future mining would probably significant impact chemistry surface ground water
