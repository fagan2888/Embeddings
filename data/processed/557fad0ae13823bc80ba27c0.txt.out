ground water quality leachate generation migration this section discussion basic process involve generation transport landfill leachate 
this discussion intend serve general review chemical process observed landfill though process observe falmouth landfill 
absence surface water drainage landfill precipitation percolate landfill 
chemical refuse added water dissolution chemical reaction 
the dissolution chemical percolate water call leach result solution leachate 
landfill impermeable base leachate percolate downward ground water system beneath site 
microbial activity within landfill break organic material refuse release carbon dioxide product 
this process utilize dissolve oxygen result leachate rapidly becomes deplete oxygen 
the leachate become reduce rather oxidize environment 
environment anaerobic bacteria 
break organic material fermentation process create methane hydrocarbon organic acid ammonia carbon dioxide 
much carbon dioxide use turn methane produce bacteria 
the combination generation ammonia removal carbon dioxide would otherwise react water form weak acid hydrogen ion leachate production methane cause increase leachate baedecker back 
the chemical composition leachate change unsaturated zone due adsorption cation exchange dissolution redox reaction microbial activity 
cation exchange replacement cation positively charge ion include ion metal adsorb grain surface cation strongly hold grain surface 
freshwater monovalent cation cation charge sodium potassium ammonium tend replace divalent trivalent cation include calcium heavy metal 
this chief mean heavy metal include lead zinc cadmium remove solution 
phosphate carbonate remove solution formation insoluble compound environmental protection agency 
iron manganese insoluble oxidize condition may mobilize refuse oxide coat sediment particle unsaturated zone reduce condition baedecker back 
saturate zone leachate generally move direction flow ground water gradually disperse downgradient landfill upgradient downgradient ground water analogue upstream downstream 
the straight line distance volume water travel aquifer source certain amount time less length actual path water travel time 
this water aquifer cannot flow directly two point rather must follow tortuous course around sediment grain comprise aquifer 
because different path flow portion leachate must take around grain two ion enter saturate zone near location time may travel distance downgradient future time 
volume leachate move aquifer leachate progressively scatter flow proceeds various direction around successive sediment grain 
this scatter effect call mechanical dispersion tend spread leachate travel downgradient 
this dilute concentration dissolve material cause leachate mix uncontaminated ground water 
mechanical dispersion great downgradient direction also lateral vertical component 
the water quality area downgradient landfill noticeably poorer surround area transport leachate 
the volume degrade water downgradient area often refer plume 
because dispersion concentration contaminant plume generally high center core plume gradually become dilute toward periphery 
oxidize condition return toward periphery reduce leachate mix uncontaminated water contains dissolve oxygen 
plume often sink within water column due density great surround water kimmel braid due overlie weight water add saturate zone precipitation downgradient landfill 
the depression plume within aquifer often lead misconception contamination ground water present location downgradient landfill sample take shallow well location contain contaminant possible plume fact present location bottom well
