deposit environment 
the cretaceous coal deposit san juan basin product former coastal swamp marsh 
these swamp marsh support heavy precipitation climate conducive rapid vegetal growth moderately fresh water 
due relatively low sulfur content san juan basin coal shomaker wtiyte suggest coal form fresh water environment

coal also form lake margin swamp inland coastal area 
shoreline oscillation subsequent influx continental marine debris upon peat accumulation produce vertical buildup stack peat deposit
