conclusion preliminary field test arsenic area undergone acid sulfate leaching red mountain area western san juan mountain seem useful geochemical prospect particularly mineralize chimney deposit 
the principal advantage test arsenic residual show anomalous broad halo define specific area relatively small pipe locality elaborate sample laboratory test 
general residual lead silver mercury conform residual arsenic value whereas copper zinc generally easily leach acid surface water 
the background value mercury somewhat erratic 
arsenic mercury also greatly exceed arsenic sensitivity local metal concentration

because metal widely disperse fracture porous rock area useful selectivity mercury determination perhaps

many pipe deposit depth tend assume linear form els become series fissure 
the delineation fissure mineralize break surface may course useful outline broad pattern mineral concentration 
whether arsenic sufficiently sensitive purpose questionable without test 
certain precaution sample sample preparation necessary obtain full advantage arsenic test 
the large quantity pyrite many sample tend interfere accuracy field determination 
accordingly fusion sample sodium peroxide prior field determination seem desirable

this difference probably result part inexperience field operator part interfere effect pyrite many sample 
the result also indicate somewhat closer spacing field sample would helpful site establish deposit
