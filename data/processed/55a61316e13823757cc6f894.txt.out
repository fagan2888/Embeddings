all mention delay also present mode shoot except additional delay introduce time record cm would record tape shot since use presently latched time store tape get update later 
the navigation data process without due regard original field time case miss shotpoints deletion data anomaly time interpolate

addition display cms start time wwv clock time also log true firing time airgun use sum shuttle pulse load clock time 
this could output line printer store tape next shotpoint 
would always shoot extra shot end line would easy exist cm software 
every shot would three way check time delay know 
this would also show wire blast time break jitter exist present tiger software tiger synchronize millisecond interrupt 
well proper record display time opportunity make correction cms recorded time know delay include due bot header dps tape change wwv cms time difference zero

appendix seg lds exchange format this appendix list fortran code use exchange refraction wide angle data 
this code series fortran equivalence statement define file trace header information program use read data 
this code develop spencer asudeh gsc use lithoprobe refraction data 
the exchange format call seg lds seg society exploration geophysicist lds lithoprobe data storage superset seg format 
whereas seg provide industry standard exchange seismicreflection data barry seg lds provide suitable format storage exchange seismic refraction data 
any exist seg program capable reading data 
however seg lds go beyond seg three way utilize unused portion seg header informaton unique refraction data extend definition organization within disk file allow require data store word format ibm real integer format define industry standard 
header definition seg lds maintain two part file organization standard seg file header byte long follow seismic trace data block contain byte trace header 
the last byte file header last byte trace header undefined original seg standard use seg lds information relative refraction data shot time 
the main addition allow storage flexible shot receiver line name shoot receiver information data word format different seismic sttributes 
comment within code clearly indicate item unique seg lds 
disk storage seg lds adapt disk storage primarily gsc 
the seg file contain number trace trace contain number data sample 
file organizaton tape consist single line header follow data block contain trace header 
the file series bytes logical record structure byte define tape 
file structure without logical record structure allow easy access machine file must machine dependent physical record length machine transparent user 
for instance byte may easily read language 
use ibm profort compiler file must open direct access chosen record length data must read buffer chunk record length 
because sophisticated processing need direct access particular trace convenient pad trace length minimum byte 
when do easy direct access bytes fortran possible 
other institution user language may ignore restriction 
data word format seg defines four data word format 
the actual format use indicated content bytes line header 
for seg lds choose fifth format gain range lunchbox format utilized gsc sixth format vax fortran 
note seg defines byte organization within byte integer tape 
this opposite vax 
yet decide would
