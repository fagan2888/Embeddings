result and discussion bromine abundance distribution halite the stratigraphic profile bromine content halite bed evaporite fig 
general typical bromine profile marine evaporite halite bed evaporite basin holser raup raup kite 
this profile plot directly analytical result smooth 
the bromine content base halite bed low increase upward toward top bed reach maximum near top 
this general trend indicate generally progressive increase salinity brine halite precipitate 
the bromine content halite bottom halite bed range ppm 
from rapid rise bromine content ppm 
from less rapid steady increase bromine content ppm 
from bromine content less constant from upward bromine content increase irregularly upward maximum ppm 
the high bromine value observe side interval imply zone potash miner 
upper bromine content decrease rapidly ppm 
the stratigraphic distribution bromine indicate evaporite formation result one deposit cycle 
marine evaporites base halite bed minimum bromine content ppm 
the bromine content increase upward brine basin become concentrated 
situation brine become highly concentrated soluble constituent sea water salt potassium magnesium precipitate 
the bromine content halite prior deposition potash mineral usually ppm 
the evaporite formation core follow pattern part the bromine distribution halite bed indicate steady increase brine salinity the vertical part profile indicate period deposition salinity brine remain fairly constant this probably result influx fresh sea water basin balance reflux high salinity brine basin 
this period influx result addition calcium sulfate basin deposition increase quantity anhydrite within halite bed fig 
bromine content halite increase rapidly ppm 
this produced salinity necessary precipitation potassium magnesium mineral 
the bromine content halite bottom halite bed particular interest interval bromine content range ppm significantly low theoretical minimum ppm firstdeposited halite sea water braitsch kiihn holser raup hite 
because low value base halite bed grade smoothly upward value consider normal marine halite possible low value reflect original deposit geochemistry 
this would require however partition coefficient bromine brine bromine incorporate halite precipitated brine different silurian age michigan basin young deposit basin present day sea water 
other factor may responsible low bromine content 
recrystallization originally deposit salt meteoric water solution low bromine content would result secondary salt low bromine content 
coarse crystal size halite base core may indicate influence recrystalhzation 
the base core contain abundant layer anhydrite interbedded halite 
significant quantity disseminate fine grain anhydrite within halite could dilute bromine content sample analyze thus produce low bromine value 
bed halite normally contain small amount percent disseminate anhydrite 
this small amount minor effect analyse bromine distribution halite 
amount percent level would cause dilution bromine sample 
further investigation need try determine reason unusually low bromine content halite base core 
insoluble mineral halite anhydrite major constituent volume percent insoluble mineral fraction halite 
the remainder quartz dolomite trace pyrite determine ray diffraction analysis 
the stratigraphic distribution weight percent insoluble mineral illustrate figure 
the insoluble material distribute evenly throughout halite bed

this interval transitional deposition limestone chloride deposition 
interval anhyomte content increase much percent indicate influx fresh sea water basin
